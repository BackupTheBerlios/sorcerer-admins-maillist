It is easier than that.
To make a runtime only installation of Sorcerer execute:

# rm -rf /usr/{include,lib{,64}/*.a}

However, using find is probably better since
the above command has a tiny probability of over-running
the command line parameter limit.

I figure it is easier to install proper spell archives
and simply rm what is not desired.


&gt;<i> We are already loosed our freedom to choose our depencies anyway, i mean X
</I>&gt;<i> Windows System is mandatory, etc. that sort of stuff.
</I>
xorg is not mandatory.
However, it can occur through optionals.
For example....
core requires a spell that provides system-logger.
rsyslog can provide system-logger
rsyslog can have an optional on postgresql
postgresql has an optional on tk
tk requires libXft and libXScrnSaver
Therefore, spell &quot;core&quot; can have libX11 in it's
requirement list although libX11 is not
a mandatory requirement for the spell &quot;core&quot;


&gt;<i> Just an idea... hybrid distro, source and binary combined...or something...
</I>
Haha, no chance.
I already have enough to do with 3000 spells.
Why would I want to turn 3000 spells into 9000+
spells like pre-compiled binary based distros do with
segregation the installation of source trees into
separate packages.
At least with Sorcerer one has 1/3 or less the headache
as with a pre-compiled binary based distro,
especially if that distro does stuff like breaking net-tools,
bind, iproute2, coreutils into separate packages that install
just single executables such as ip, ping, dig, named, etc...

Sorcerer may not look like it offers much software selection,
but it has at least as much software as would any
pre-compiled binary based distro with 10,000 packages offers.

Having over 1000 installed &quot;packages&quot; is tedious micro-management
to decide exactly what should be kept and what can be discarded.
I remember a decade ago looking at the list of installed software
in dselect and list of available software in dselect and thinking
what a chore it is to go through it all.
That was with Debian.
At least before we transitioned from XFree86 to xorg
we could enjoy boxes with as little as a couple hundred installed spells.
But now 400 to 1400 installed spells is not uncommon.
At least the dispel menu in sorcery offers a quick and sane way
to select spells for removal without having to manually inspect
and consider all 1000 installed spells.

I recall someone wrote some sort of orphan program in order
to discover installed packages on Debian that were not required
and offer the SA the opportunity to remove that software.
At least with Sorcerer that is not required.
Our dispel menu in sorcery is a very sane and quick way
of dispelling stale software.

I would not be surprised if the average SA has no clue about
what half the installed software on their box does.
I would not be surprised if the average SA does not
know the names of half the installed software on their box.
At least with Sorcerer, SAs have a chance of understanding
what is installed, what it should do, and why it is installed.

Back in the DOS days I could know every file on my fixed disk.
Those days will never return.
However, Sorcerer offers intimacy with a box as close as that
can approximate with a modern selection of software.

At the same time Sorcerer offers profiles that allow
many spells to be part of a group of spells such as:
&quot;core&quot; &quot;gnome&quot; &quot;kde&quot;
That way SAs that want to keep their relationship with their box
strictly professional and not at all intimate can use profile spells
when they are available.

Few SAs have expressed any interest in profile spells.
That is why there are so few profile spells.
However, there could be more profile spells that can control
various aspects in a top down orderly fashion.
With profiles the role of a box could be selected as:
server, workstation, or both.
A desired web server to install could be selected from a list of webservers.
The same for a database if a database is required, etc...
It would be possible if those profile spells were written.

For the moment categories offer a poor substitute for better profile spells.
Still SAs can get the desired software installed the way it is,
if the SA knows what software they want installed.
But it is not at all friendly to a new SA who does not even
know what spells gcc and make are supposed to do.

Currently, sorcery's cast is optimized for speed.
It sometimes ask more optional requirement questions than necessary.
It probably asks them in an order that has nothing to do with the order
in which the spells would be installed.
It is not as suitable for elaborate profile spells as it could be.
But it is fast.

I toughed on the subject of profile spells,
because they can expand the convenience offered to SAs
similar to what might be offered with pre-compiled binary based distros,
while still using the same sorcery tools without much modification.


As for categories and attributes.
Many spells could use some cleaning.
SAs introduce spells into the grimoire entirely weird new categories
and attributes instead of using those that are already defined.
Consequently, it makes finding some spells difficult
when one is searching by category or attribute and not name.
