I remember setting up a dual boot 2 drive configuration.
The box had windoze XP and Sorcerer IA32.
For windoze XP to boot windoze XP had to own the MBR
and start running from from the MBR.
It could not simply be booted like windoze 98/95 from the partition.
To do so would invoke the windoze XP resecue/repair program.

The solution was to have the Sorcerer disk first in the boot sequence,
have it load the ms-sys MBR, and then lilo in the boot block,
and then have lilo switch the BIOS assignment of drives
and load the MBR from the windoze disk if booting into windoze XP.

Having Sorcerer's lilo installed into a boot block is very much
a convenience for SAs so that if they happen to try to dual install
Sorcerer and M$ on the same disk then it might not wreck the M$ installation.
Perhaps M$'s XP or later bootloader can load a linux distro?


&gt;<i> if you have several os installed then all are running race condition about
</I>&gt;<i> whom will write the mbr..... either you have to maintain all the
</I>&gt;<i> configuration of all os to be certains they will keep track of the other, or

</I>
Exactly.  Having Sorcerer's lilo install to a boot block of a partition
instead of the MBR allows for something awesome like having
separate x86_64 and IA32 installations of Sorcerer.
Chaining from lilo in the x86_64 boot block to lilo in the IA32 boot
block is trivial.
However, it is not even required since the IA32 installation can be mounted
within the x86_64 installations as /opt/ia32
Then, it can be used concurrently by some additional lines added to
/etc/ld.so.conf and additional PATH statements.
Updating Sorcerer IA32 from an x86_64 installation is as easy as
# chroot /opt/ia32
And then doing all the regularly stuff.


&gt;<i> I can even update a i586 sorcerer from the x86_64 one without bothering ;)
</I>
Right, without bothering to reboot into it.


&gt;<i> anyway if grub has to be installed into mbr I will likely never use it....
</I>
If grub is installed into the MBR and that disk is in the boot sequence
then you will probably have to use grub.
However, I expect that grub can probably be configured to chain
to running lilo in the boot block of a Sorcerer installation.
In that way a SA could still run grub and yet still leave the decision
of what kernel and initramfs to load to the configuration of lilo.


&gt;<i> look at the &quot;rescue usb disk&quot; I made, without lilo it wouldn't even exist or
</I>&gt;<i> you will have to waste a full usb drive for having a small rescue disk, on
</I>&gt;<i> this you have a lilo installed on boot sector of the partition, allowing to
</I>&gt;<i> move it anywhere you want... on a sdcard, on an usb drive, on flash, on a
</I>&gt;<i> harddrive.... it's STANDALONE
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that lilo shall use 1rst partition block as default and optional mbr
</I>&gt;<i> (for crapy filesystems that don't support having a boot sector) and shall
</I>&gt;<i> use UUID by default (and not the old /dev/sd* or /dev/hd* or /dev/mmc*
</I>&gt;<i> or.....) like this anywhere you go, whatever the physical medium of your
</I>&gt;<i> drive, it will boot as expected
</I>
That just about summarizes my feelings about it also.
However, the convenience of being able to install a boot loader
into the MBR can not be underestimated for SAs.
However, it might also be possible that &quot;BIOS enabled virus protection&quot;
might inhibit writes to the MBR and might also fail an update of the MBR?
Linux, however, probably will probably not use BIOS calls to write to a disk?
But even so I feel more comfortable with a ms-sys MBR
that works and does not change.

grub setup to provide a selection to other bootloaders
might also be a viable solution for the MBR because
some types of grub installations,
that would not involve actual selection of linux kernels and initramfs,
would not have to be updated regularly.
In that fashion grub could be installed once and then provide the
selection of whether to boot Sorcerer x86_64, Sorcerer IA32, or
some other POSIX or BSD style installations.
However, chaining from lilo to lilo is just as easy.
