<PRE>Recently, I was thinking that executables can be categorized in 3 ways.
1. Those that exist but are never run.
2. Those that exist and are run sometimes.
3. Those that exist and are run repeatedly.

However, the categories are not a perfect fit for programs.
/bin/sed for example we normally think of as being category 1.
Yet libtool runs /bin/sed repeatedly.
gcc is definitely a category 3 program, because during compilation
of software make invokes gcc repeatedly, usually each time an object
file is created.

I am curious about how to make category 3 programs,
those which are run repeatedly, run faster.
Optimization is one possibility.
However, -O3 makes almost no difference for a program that runs for a
short while.
Instead static linking will reduce the amount of time required to
start those programs.
However, static linking has two obvious costs.
Statically linked executables require more disk space
and they do not provide native language translation.

How important is language translation for gcc and sed error messages?
Is it okay to have a development environment that is almost entirely in English?
Afterall, sorcery does not have decent language translations.
User programs and desktop environments and text editors and such
would still have native language translation where it is already provided.


Before someone objects to the huge size difference for static linking,
I may have a solution for that.
By static linking with uClibc instead of glibc
the size of executables that are statically linked with libc.a
can be reasonable.

I was playing with that recently and wrote a hello.c program that uses printf.
Here is the size of the executable:
glibc dynamic linked 5.3K
uClibc static linked 13K
glibc static linked 608K

Yes statically linked with uClibc's libc.a is larger than glibc
dynamically linked.
But the size difference is reasonable considering that the statically linked
executable loads even faster than a dynamically linked ELF with prelinking.
As we remember pre-linking was a mixed boon since it wasted address space,
but more important modified previously installed ELF libraries and thus
changing the md5sum signatures for previously installed software.
There has not even been a new release of prelink since the start of 2006.

Finally have some speed tests on the pentium 3.

1000 invocations:

4.7s with uClibc static
6.3s with glibc ELF
5.1s with glibc static

Naturally, I have the output piped to /dev/null for the test.
And as we can see a very simple executable statically linked with
uClibc starts faster.
Also in the dynamically linked version
there are not that many symbols to resolve
and link since it is merely a program that invokes printf.
Consequently, the time required for dynamic linking will be much greater
for more complex programs that use many libc functions.

Opinions please?
