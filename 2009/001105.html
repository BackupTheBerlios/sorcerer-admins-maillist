<PRE>you have another side that you have to take into account when making 
tests.... the lazyness of the ld.so.... ld.so can resolve symbols at 
runtime (lazy) or at loadtime (now), it can be set by an env variable if 
i'm correct
lazy resolv is usefull if you won't likely have to resolv lot of 
fuctions, for example :
if (choice ==1)
{
     functionA();
     functionB();
}
else
{
      functionC();
      functionD();
}
if we are in the case choice ==1 then resolving C and D is only a waste 
of time..... that's why lazy is the default, however lazy resolving has 
a lot overhead on runtime....
I never made bench with thoses 2 resolv.... maybe it's a good idea

</I>&gt;<i> However, if Sorcerer did transition to uClibc

</I>&gt;<i> And by frequently, I mean several times a second.
</I>&gt;<i> static linking firefox, for example, would grant no benefit

</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, for user apps such firefox and desktop environments
</I>&gt;<i> static linking wastes while providing a negligible speed increase.
</I>&gt;<i> Jan provide a good insight about SDD drives.
</I>&gt;<i> With no seek time they read multiple files nearly as fast as single files.
</I>&gt;<i> Statically linked executables would still start faster on SDD drives,
</I>&gt;<i> but the initial reading of files from ?disk? to RAM would be no faster.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I did my speed test with a hello.c program.
</I>&gt;<i> Naturally, those 1000 consecutive executions of the program
</I>&gt;<i> were done from cached RAM and not from disk.
</I>&gt;<i> statically linked executables start faster not for having to
</I>&gt;<i> read less files on disk, but because there is less runtime linking.
</I>&gt;<i> Dynamically linked ELFs are like a puzzle that must be assembled
</I>&gt;<i> everytime one wants to look at the picture.
</I>&gt;<i> Statically linked executables are like a puzzle already glued together.
</I>&gt;<i> Since runtime linking happens quickly on modern computers,
</I>&gt;<i> the time required for runtime linking is not usually considered.
</I>&gt;<i> But it exists.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would be more happy to see the .a removed from my disk... their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> presence not only waste disk space but also drop performance since a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directory with a large set of object is slower to access.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree.
</I>&gt;<i> About half a year ago I went through the grimoire making more
</I>&gt;<i> libraries install only shared versions and thus eliminating the
</I>&gt;<i> presence of the static .a libraries on updates.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet even for the benefit of RAM conversation and reduce disk consumption
</I>&gt;<i> there are times when using static linking provides better performance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, when using only glibc
</I>&gt;<i> I waffled about the benefit of static linking.
</I>&gt;<i> static linking with glibc creates executables that are huge!
</I>&gt;<i> I want to infer from that that glibc is not intended for static linking.
</I>&gt;<i> However uClibc is intended for static linking.
</I>&gt;<i> When it comes to sinking a screw
</I>&gt;<i> a screw driver is better tool than a claw hammer.
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise, uClibc is a better tool for static linking.
