It may come as a surprise be we have no consensus about networking
configuration.
Each SAs starts networking differently depending on what they want.
However, I have tried to provide a potentially useful framework.
Unfortunately, it may not be thoroughly tested.

/etc/init.d/networks is the script responsible for raising networks during boot.
It runs once during sysinit and once during the runlevel transition.
That way if networks can not be set up during sysinit
then they can be set up during the runlev el after root filesystem
has transition from initramfs to the real root filesystem.

/etc/init.d/networks is very simple.
It runs files in /etc/networks.d/
Each file should describe a network.
The return status of running the file should
indicate if the network was set up correctly.
/etc/init.d/networks.d/ continues to run files in
/etc/networks.d/ until a network is successfully set up
or there are no more files in /etc/networks.d/ to run

Files in /etc/networks.d/
invoke one or more configured interface templates.
That is because a box on a network may have more
than one networking interface and might use more
than one specific network depending upon where it
is connected when networking starts.

The template file used to have code in it.
There used to be different template files
that had different code to execute that
the SA would select depending on the type
of network that is desired.
But that has changed.

The network file is now more like a form.
Fill out some variables and it is good to go.
That is because the code for deciding how the network
should be set up is contained in a separate functions file:
/etc/networks.d/functions/functions

If you only have one interface to set up
then you can do something very simple
# cd /etc/networks.d/
# cp template/links/generic primary
# nano primary
# /etc/init.d/networks start

If there is only one interface
then merely copy and fill out the generic form
and comment out unused declared variables.

The actual setting up of networks is handled by
invoking various tools such as:

net-tools
iproute2
dhcpcd
wireless_tools

and similar software projects.

An experienced SA would simply write files into
/etc/networks.d/
that have start() and stop() functions
that invoke the tools directly.
That way they will do exactly what the SA wants.

Other distros have a thick layer the separates the SA
from actually knowing what networking tools are
and how to invoke them.
Sorcerer has only a thin convenience layer.
It allows SAs maximum flexibility for setting up networks.
However, for lack of a tight constraint is it not obvious
to newer SAs exactly how and what is proper.

The general rule about setting up networks on a Sorcerer box
is that if it works and the SA likes it
then that was the right way.

The best help for setting up networking is to read a HowTo
from the linux documentation project.
Distributions may have different convenience layers to
obfuscate or ease the SA's job of setting up networking.
However, all distributions have the same core networking
utilities such as /sbin/ip

I am one of the people who wants a better method,
perhaps even menu driven method for setting up networks on Sorcerer.
But due to a lack of consensus and a lack of effort
it did not happen in 2008.
But there were other nice improvements to the distro instead.

As far as networking goes I know about average.
Like most Sorcerer SAs I can invoke the tools and
set up networking on my boxes and then forget
about it for nearly the rest of my life.
Only once have I made the mistake of assigning the same
IP address to interfaces on different boxes.
Therefore, to experienced Sorcerer SAs network is already moot point.

But for people new to the distro
networking, as you pointed out, is a sore point.

Although the basis of the Sorcerer's method for starting networking
is from the init-script /etc/init.d/networks
networking could also be started from udev cold plugging.
Although I know it is possible I would not know how to
write those rules without reading some documentation first.
But my point is that there is no one right way to do it.

Even a 3rd party method network management system might
be a welcome inclusion to Sorcerer.
However, I am not inclined to just use the same one as provided
in Debian nor in Redhat.

If someone with good idea of all or most type of networks
wanted to cooperate with me on this we could write a dialog
driven wizard that enabled creating network configuration files
by answering a series of questions and then be able to select
and group network configuration files into network groups.

However, the closer we move to an abstract layer of setting it up
automatically the more comprehensive it must be about the
coverage of network types.
Otherwise SAs will might think that their network type is not supported
and then abandon Sorcerer without even trying to run the tools
such as /sbin/ip directly.

That is why the current process of configuring the network requires the
SA to copy and edit files in /etc/networks.d/ and subdirs of it
so that the SA has the complete responsibility and control over
configuring interfaces and networks on that box.


Some useful information:

<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/Networking-Overview-HOWTO/">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/Networking-Overview-HOWTO/</A>
man ip
/etc/networks.d/templates/README

I was just editing the README.
And it still seems as if it would be confusing
to anyone that did not already understand the concept


If all of that above seems like too much of a pain.
Just write to the list what your network should be
and we can give you a file such as
/etc/init.d/network to place in /etc/init.d/
with mode 0700
that will start and stop that network directly
without doing all the stuff involving files in /etc/networks.d/
But that solution is only for a simple single network configuration.
If the box requires a fancier network solution
then the way to go is to follow the design of using
network groups and network links.
Doing so avoids a creating a very long and complicated init-script
by instead using separate bash scripts to provide the grouping
for links/interfaces into distinct network configurations.
