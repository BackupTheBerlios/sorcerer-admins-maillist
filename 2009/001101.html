That is good.
I am still testing gcc 4.4.0
I probably ran into some disappointing results before,
because I forgot to break gcc's fix-includes.
I really hate that.
I wonder if there is anyone who benefits and wants gcc
modified header files?

</I>&gt;<i> the last one.
</I>
Perhaps the website is down?
We do not exactly have a public source cache at the moment.
I have mc-4.6.2.tar.7z
Want me to email it to you?


&gt;<i> in ffmpeg opts I still need to remove --enable-libswscale to have it
</I>&gt;<i> compile.
</I>
In addition to there being newer ffmpeg
the latest version of linphone requires the newer ffmpeg.
Do you expect any problems with updating ffmpeg?
Or should we still sit on it?


&gt;<i> From the glibc spell I can see that it is no simple task to get glibc to
</I>&gt;<i> compile &amp; install.
</I>
In some ways uclibc will be easier,
yet it other ways more difficult.
Most libraries when they break binary compatibility
they change the soname so that the new so has a
different soname than the old so.
For example:

/lib/libform.so.5.7
is a library from ncurses.
Above is the full name of the library.
The soname is libform.so.5
If binary compatibility breaks with the next version of ncurses released
then the library will probably be named
/lib/libform.so.6.0
And the so name would be
libform.so.6

uClibc changes the library name on each release,
but not the sonames.
I probably require a far more clever and complex method
than the library cache for handling re-installation of
the currently installed version of uClibc with ELF libraries.
Probably I would require a statically linked mv,
perhaps from busybox.
That way I could do some sort of a fast switch,
moving the old directory to a different name
and the new directory to the proper name
and then eliminating the old directory.
It really is dreadful and I would require at least
a week to think about it and decide how to
do it eloquently without causing any libc ELF
library breaks.

I was just thinking that if uClibc made the soname
the same as the library name
then that would not be half bad.
Afterall why only go halfway along with the disguise
of being an ELF library when it does not properly
change the soname on each binary incompatible release?
Perhaps I can write a patch for that.


&gt;&gt;<i> An entirely static linked executable would also not depend upon
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ld.so nor libc.so.6 in order to run.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even if /lib/ or /lib64/ were missing the program would run if invoked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it would be a good idea to make at least the core utilities that
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer needs statically linked? That way you can cast your way out of
</I>&gt;<i> trouble like I had with my other box.
</I>
I am considering providing a uClibc statically linked busybox.
However, coreutils or at least most of coreutils I want to keep
dynamically linked.
That way I can intercept invocations of libc functions in programs
such as cp, install, mkdir
That convenience is essential for sentinel to be able to track
the files and directories that compiled sources install and modify.
I do not yet want to give up on using sentinel.


&gt;&gt;<i> Speaking of stability.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I suspect that the recent instability you noticed was from gcc
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4.4.0 being installed without first breaking fix-includes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gcc copying and modifying installed header files for other software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is a very unfortunate thing that causes terrible problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, will we try gcc 4.4.0 again sometime in the future?
</I>
Maybe.
If so, I will add in a check to make certain that the installed
version is one without fix-includes in case any boxes or SAs
want to simply restore the previous archive from /var/cache/archive/
But for the moment it might not be a bad idea to wait for gcc 4.4.1
Besides, I have a new linux-modular to compile,
and I want to recompile glibc and a few other software projects
for the next I/R release.

I recently encountered some problems with libcap,
and so I am making libcap go away.
Seems to have compile issues.
It might not be compatible with the latest linux kernel.

I am not forcing boxes to recompile glibc.
However, it might not be a bad idea.
The newer glibc spell, which will be arriving soon,
requires a linux-headers spell to be installed.
Consequently, glibc no longer installs headers for linux.
