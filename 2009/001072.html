</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that raid array can be dynimically updated like lvm allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I was deciding how it aught to work I found it interesting that
</I>&gt;<i> certain choices had to be made that exclude some methods.
</I>&gt;<i> Having LVM2 on top of software RAIDs made sense at the time.
</I>&gt;<i> Use the software RAID to group up the disks.
</I>&gt;<i> Use the LVM2 to break it down.
</I>&gt;<i> However, LVM2 can also be used to group disks.
</I>&gt;<i> But it does not have the same benefits of the software RAID.
</I>&gt;<i> Are there reasons why this order is a mistake or less useful
</I>&gt;<i> than had it been the other way around?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) encryption is the only thing that would work ;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so I'll drop the idea of using lvm, it's sure interesting to be more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flexible and allow fast resizing of partitions, however I don't change  my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partition size every weekend and the actual size seems to fit me...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'll then simply activate my suspend (there are boons with suspend,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> especially on laptops when you run out of battery and don't wanna loose all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your open applications...) and toy around with ext4....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using LUKS encrypted partitions on a notebook that can suspend to disk
</I>&gt;<i> seems counter intuitive, as I mentioned previously.
</I>&gt;<i> Something that might otherwise be encrypted could end up
</I>&gt;<i> written to the swap unencrypted during the suspend.
</I>&gt;<i> If someone managed to un-suspend from disk the notebook
</I>&gt;<i> then the encryption key for / or /home will be loaded back into
</I>&gt;<i> memory and those filesystems will be mounted
</I>&gt;<i> when the notebook resumes running
</I>&gt;<i> if those filesystems were mounted when the notebook was suspended.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although I have not checked prices on large solid state drives,
</I>&gt;<i> probability for an extra $100 a notebook can have a USB
</I>&gt;<i> solid state drive to store almost everything required.
</I>&gt;<i> The fixed disk could be turned into an extra long term
</I>&gt;<i> storage area and spun up and down only when required.
</I>&gt;<i> Probably a memory drive will not be as fast as a fixed disk,
</I>&gt;<i> but the random access times should be excellent!
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>not exactly... usb is a rather slow ass bus... bandwith is great but 
responsiveness is poor....
&gt;<i> It could make loading programs such as firefox nearly instant.
</I>&gt;<i> firefox, for example, access many files while loading.
</I>&gt;<i> And while each file might not be fragmented,
</I>&gt;<i> they might not be close to each other on disk.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>well according to my tests on fast sdcard, the system is usable but 
takes about 1.5 times the one on the disk
&gt;<i> Maybe longer battery life can be achieved by not using the fixed disk drive?
</I>&gt;<i> I vaguely recollect seeing a notebook that advertised a battery charge
</I>&gt;<i> that would power and run the notebook for 7 hours.
</I>&gt;<i> Keep a notebook at 12.5% throttle, do not use the fixed disk drive,
</I>&gt;<i> reduce LCD back-light intensity and maybe it can run for a while?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>lcd is the most energy eater of the pc... however transflective lcd 
aren't widely available.... sadely
yes not using the disk can save some power.... however my laptop barely 
use the disk, my 2G ram never fil more than 500Mo (appart when 
compiling) so disk is almost all time in suspend state....
&gt;<i> Obviously, with 35W CPUs the notebook computer is not yet
</I>&gt;<i> approaching the efficiency of a solar calculator.  *lol*
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I want a 16 gigaherts, 16 core, 256 bit, solar powered notebook.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe someday, yes?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>well appart the frequency.... powers consumption increase with 
frequency, if I'm correct in a way that is exponential an not simply 
linear, but for our cpu frequency it can be approximated as linear
on the other hand multiplying the number of core don't increase much the 
cpu consumption, a 2 core cpu provide about 1,90 the calcul power of a 
single core at the same frequency, but consume at most 1,5 the power of 
the single core, so if the software is well optimised for multicpu then 
you can increase average calcul power with decreasing average consuption....
&gt;<i> I am open to suggestions for making Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> boot and shutdown run faster.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
the problem isn't speed, but rather saving application state and be 
certain to restore it.... I never managed to make it work correctly... 
so suspend is the only way I found to be certain to save and restore my 
env....
