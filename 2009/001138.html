<PRE>The default value is 180 seconds.
However, it requires no more than a few seconds in qemu.
Waiting for it is probably best.
But if you prefer
then a sleep statement can be used instead.
However, if important devices such as disks
are not yet detected, drivers loaded, and have device nodes
then premature continuation of booting will cause the proper
/ to not be mounted.
Instead it may end up at a menu or with initramfs mounted as /

Instead of using udevadm settle
there is udevadm monitor
If running the init-scripts one at a time
then after starting udevadm trigger
udevadm monitor can be started to view what is happening.
The manual page for udevadm has written:

   udevadm monitor [options]
       Listens to the kernel uevents and events sent out by a udev
rule and prints the
       devpath of the event to the console. It can be used to analyze
the event timing, by
       comparing the timestamps of the kernel uevent and the udev event.

       --environment
           Print the complete environment for all events. Can be used
to compare the
           kernel supplied and the udev added environment values.

       --kernel
           Print the kernel uevents.

       --udev
           Print the udev event after the rule processing.

       --help
           Print help text.



Because having udev complete cold plug device detect and provisioning
is important to successful booting I should not circumvent udevadm settle.
However, if one were to detect what device emulation in vmware is
causing udevadm settle to delay for so long
then it might be possible to start vmware without that device emulation
and thus avoid the 180 second udevadm settle delay during boot.

Therefore, this problem is best solved by either the SA,
vmware team, or udev team.

Lastly udevadm settle also support an optional timeout value.
However, I do not know if coldplug events are handled parallel
or serial by udev.  Having udevadm settle exit prematurely
may cause unhandled events and thus the disks may not yet be ready.
Then again, maybe they are ready and booting could continue.
 I merely go with the 180 second default,
because that is what udev is programmed with
and is probably reasonably safe.

If it really does hang (forever) as in longer than 5 minutes
then please report that on the udev email list.

Thanks for the report.
