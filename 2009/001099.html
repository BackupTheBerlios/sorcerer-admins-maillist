<PRE>&gt;<i> I am also curious about the Debian moving their distro over to eglibc (

</I>
<A HREF="http://www.eglibc.org/faq">http://www.eglibc.org/faq</A>

That purty much sums it up.
uClibc would be a better choice for Sorcerer.

If Sorcerer did eventually transition over to an almost entirely
uClibc based distribution
then the problems with non binary compatible upgrades may
be circumvented by compiling software linked
with uClibc's ELF libraries with RPATHs.
That way uClibc's ELFs can be installed in version specific directories
yet also be properly loaded according to the version of uClibc
that was used when a program was compiled.

The backward binary compatibility with glibc is something nice to have.
But it is not essential for a source based distribution.
Obviously, eglibc will not only have glibc's quality of
backward binary compatibility, but eglibc is a fork of glibc
intended to be such a mirror of glibc
that it will be a drop in replacement for glibc
and be both a source and a binary compatible replacement.
It appears that eglibc will be a minimally modified fork of glibc.
The exact motivation for this fork I is probably not apparent,
unless you want to take the FAQ at face value.

eglibc will probably create a division of effort
while at the same time limit eglibc development
so that it can not evolve substantially beyond glibc.
Burnt toast with some of the charred crumbs
scrapped off still tastes like burnt toast.

uClibc still has a bit of the smell,
but not as much of the taste.
uClibc developers are not trying to maintain binary compatibility with glibc.
Consequently, they are more free to make changes that seem beneficial.
Of course it places more burden on the distribution maintainer/integrator
in order to make it all work properly.
For that reason I am not rushing into any big changes.
