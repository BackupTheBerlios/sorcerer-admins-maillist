<PRE>That may be possible.
I usually keep all the spells on my boxes at
the current stable versions recommended by the grimoire.
Therefore, I do not check odd combinations of old and new spells.
However, it is known from past experience that long combinations
of old and new software do not always work.
There was the coreutils requiring a newer linux problem
about a year or two ago.
And more recently either udev or util-linux or
some important software project like that
required newer glibc headers because there was
a header that it required that was not supplied by glibc 2.7

Unless there is reason to hold something back
then generally the safest route is to update all
installed software to current recommended stable levels.
Although I try to add security updates
to the secure version progress.
However, sometimes I do not discover
that an update is for security reasons.

Spell build() might sometimes support older versions of software.
However, they are only required to support compiling the
version specified version in the stable version progress.
That is because if the software is to be installed
or is to be recast due to library updates
then usually the most current stable release is compiled.
Although other version progress is available for some spells
I do not guarantee that it works or was tested.
That was implemented merely because that functionality
was a request made around 2002.
All SAs should please double check
and do their own testing for spells
that have non stable version progress.
