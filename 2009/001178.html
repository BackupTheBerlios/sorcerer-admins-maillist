<PRE>I fixed about 10 sources in grimorie spells today.
Part of it was due to selinux related source tarballs moving.
Someone fixed up one spell, partially,
but neglected to adjust the sources for the others.
Obviously, fixing the &quot;url&quot; and &quot;source&quot; is spells is a worthwhile effort.
Some SAs have tried, but I do not know if anyone is doing it now.

Also Sorcerer is spelled Sorcerer and not sorceror.  :)
Takes too long to type it eror, and it looks too much like error.  :)
*lol*

If you want to do something that contributes
to Sorcerer development please do.
Most SAs that participate do what they see needs to be done
if they so feel like doing it.
Generally, I do not crack the whip at anyone.
:<i>)
</I>
There is always more to be done than I have time nor CPU to do,
consequently, much new and potential beneficial changes I would
not even dream of this year.
But since every SA is different and has different roles for their boxes,
their perspective on how Sorcerer should improve is different.

For example, at the moment there is a bit of a backroom discussion
ongoing about how sorcery can be made more cross-compile friendly.
However, it somewhat depends on how sentinel can be replaced
with a method involving fuse filesystems.
Or perhaps those are two separate discussions.
It can be a bit confusing at times.

Anyway, I do not do much cross compiling.
In order to create the i586-linux-uclibc port
I created a cross-compile toolchain of 4 spells,
then I cross compiled about 10 software projects,
and finally I turned it over to cast to grind out 300+
native compilations.
Currently, 269 spells in the queue.

I expect that success with helping Sorcerer development
depends upon creating a sub-project that is within both
the scopes of knowledge and ability of the person doing it.
Also the person must be eager to put forth the effort.

For example in the past several people have said,
I am going to port Sorcerer to architecture &quot;X&quot;
But does it happen?
Yes once!
Jan ported Sorcerer to x86_64 architecture
and did so mostly on his own.
And it required a huge amount of time, effort, and skill.
But he did it.
Yet most people who say they will do it,
are unable to complete it,
and all their effort goes to waste.

There was one person who said that he converted an existing
distro on alpha to Sorcerer.
And  I made him an alpha sentinel to use on it
so that there would be no need to run strace instead.
strace has a huge 30% or more CPU overhead.
However, unfortunately, the I/R for an alpha port of
Sorcerer was never contributed to me.
Therefore, it is currently unknown if Sorcerer will on alpha exist.

Someone also wanted to port Sorcerer to xbox.
But years have past and I suppose it never happened.
It probably goes to illustrate that ports to new architectures
are a bit too heavy a subproject for most SAs to start with.

Documentation, for example, may be easier
and it also helps the SA writing the documentation
to learn how to wield sorcery better.
Spell checking and improvement are also good places to start.
In both cases a SA can specialize in what they want to document
or improve and can start with something small and achieve a
successful outcome for even just a day's worth of effort.

In addition to doing what you see needs to be done,
my advice is to start with planning and implementation
for that which can be accomplished within a day.
That way if necessary it can even be spread across a week
and yet success will still come even if there are set backs.

For example, one task that a SA might decide is to
review the verbose help provided on the modular augur
functions in the directory /usr/libexec/sorcery/augur.d/
That way if something more should be said about it
then the description can be improved.
Periodically I do this.
Yet I am not entirely certain if what is said about those functions
is sufficient for SAs to understand.

Probably adding documentation close to the sorcery tools
may be better than on a wiki or a website.
The boxes already have the tools installed.
SAs might look there for answers first,
without knowing that there exists somewhere a wiki or website.

In the past the problem with external documentation
is that it goes obsolete quickly.
Almost no documentation external to the sorcery tools
that describe the sorcery tools describes the sorcery tools
that we have used within the last year or two.

Wiki's have boons and banes, of course.
But putting as much quality docs directly into
the sorcery tools as is possible
aught to help SAs stay happier for not
having to look long, far and hard to
find the answer to their question.
