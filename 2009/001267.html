<PRE># du -sm /boot/* | head -n 3

85      /boot/2.6.30

Hmm, does seem larger on my test box also.
However, it is not yet +100M big.

The initrd is composed of select files and directories
archived into a cpio from the directories
/etc /bin /sbin /lib /lib64

Static archive libraries are not included in the archive.
Nothing from /etc/sorcery/ is included.
Many files in /etc/ are not included.
However, if you did something like
# cp -av /etc/sorcery /etc/sorcery.old
then that would cause a large amount of files
to be included in the cpio archive that are
not essential for booting.

Instead of trying to determine exactly
what directories from /etc are worth
including in the initramfs I tried to discover
what directories in /etc/ could be installed by a spell
yet would not be required during sysinit.
I saved a considerable amount of space
in the initramfs by excluding only that.
However, a SA could still create directories
in /etc/ that consume space on the initramfs
yet are otherwise useless during booting.

No doubt that a method for creating a more precise initramfs is possible.
However, I expect it would also require almost constant revision.
If something new is introduced that installs into /bin /sbin /lib or /lib64
and would be required during sysinit
then the initramfs script would require adjustment
or at least some component sourced in by the initramfs
would need to be changed.

If you want a better/more precise initramfs script
then spell complexity must be increased in order
to specify precisely what should be inclined
on an intiramfs if such directories as
/bin /sbin /lib /lib64 and /etc are not included nearly as a whole.

However, from /lib in each initramfs only the
/lib/modules/$VERSION/ from the appropriate kernel version
is included in that initramfs.
Consequently, only modules to load
that are appropriate for the running kernel
are included on the initramfs.

Originally, my design was to create merely one initramfs
usable by all kernels installed in /boot
A single initramfs is faster to generate.
However, booting is a bit slower to load
such a large initramfs, and of course more
memory is required in order to store the entire
content of /lib/modules in the initramfs instead
of only modules required by the kernel being booted.

I mentioned that old method that I obsoleted to demonstrate
that there are potentially other ways of building the initramfs.
Also the initramfs can be compressed in order to conserve maybe 30%.
However, the initramfs is only compressed by default
when it is provided on the Install/Rescue CD.

So the fun options for making the initramfs
require less disk space are: compression or redesign.

I have accepted that initramfs will become larger in time.
Eventually a 256M initramfs will not be absurd.
Even a modern kernel and boot loader can handle it.
Therefore, I am not overly worried about a 100M initramfs.
However, I am not closed to discussion about
what should be done to improve initramfs generation.

Also I should mention that in the past I attempted to selectively
exclude kernel modules and module directories that I expected
would be unessential during sysinit.
However, SAs complained.
Consequently, each initrmafs has a complete set of modules
that is appropriate for the kernel being boot.
Yet it does consume considerable space.
