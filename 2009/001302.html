<PRE>I expected that I had fixed the gawk spell
to prevent that from happening.
I have also old and current gawk logs:

/usr/bin/awk
/usr/bin/gawk
/usr/bin/gawk-3.1.6
/usr/bin/igawk
/usr/bin/pgawk
/usr/bin/pgawk-3.1.6

/usr/bin/awk
/usr/bin/gawk
/usr/bin/gawk-3.1.7
/usr/bin/igawk
/usr/bin/pgawk


As evident the install location did not change.
However, it might be possible that there were some boxes
with an older gawk that was installed in /bin instead
and that could explain why the update failed.

Oddly with version 3.1.7 gawk began requiring that awk
still be installed while gawk is installing.
In other words it forced that awk and gawk become
immutable programs.
I have no idea why the software authors did this.
It seems as if it would be a mistake to require that
the old must still be installed while the new is installing.
make is also weird like that since make is also required
in order to run make install when installing make.

If I had your box I would be tempted to temporarily copy awk
and gawk to /usr/local/bin and then cast gawk
and if it succeeded then remove the awk and gawk from /usr/local/bin
Sorry for the inconvenience.
I tested the gawk update on two boxes to make sure that I had it correct.
However, I did not anticipate that a gawk and awk could be installed
as /bin/{awk,gawk}
Sorry about that.

Thanks for the error report.
