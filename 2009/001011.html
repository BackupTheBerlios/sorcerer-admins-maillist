<PRE>It has several requirements where it does not list it's homepage.
Therefore, I have not tested it yet.
However, I did read some of the documentation.

According to: <A HREF="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/User_FAQ">http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/User_FAQ</A>

&quot;    * Tickless Linux timer: VirtualBox currently does not work well
on Linux kernels with tickless timer support (CONFIG_NO_HZ enabled).
We are investigating the problem but in the meantime you should
disable the tickless timer by disabling that config option or by
adding nohz=off to the Linux kernel command line.
      Starting with VirtualBox 1.5.6 the Linux kernel module knows the
parameter force_async_tsc. Try loading the kernel module with

      modprobe vboxdrv force_async_tsc=1

      and see if that helps to improve things for you.
      (Should not be necessary anymore since VirtualBox 1.6.0) &quot;

Yet it might still be required, because Sorcerer I/Rs are tickless.
There may be other reasons in the VirtualBox documentation
that explain why VirtualBox does not perform good while running a Sorcerer I/R.
For the most part the Sorcerer I/Rs have all the same optimization and
experimental
features enabled as would be in the kernels compiled when a box updates.
The kernels are for as decent performance as modular architecture allows.
They are not intended to be safe.
They are intended to make use of every nifty feature that it can support
for the CPU instruction set that is available and other installed hardware.

I once had a uniprocess CPU for which the APIC was broken.
However, with the kernel parameter to disable APIC,
or rather I simply did not compile support for it,
the kernel was usable and stable.
With APIC it was unusable.

Many kernel parameters are listed in
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
It is worth looking at.
And if one has a hunch that something could be disabled that is problematic
then it is usually easy enough to try disabling it with a kernel parameter.

For example of interesting and somewhat expected parameters,
the linux kernel now has memory testing code.
And it can be activated with memtest=

Reading /usr/src/linux/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
from time to time is good for a yawn or sometimes discovering
something potentially useful.
Sort of makes one wonder if it would be nice to have a bootloader
that can display that file before booting.
Considering how grub can read some types of filesystems
it may be possible to display that file?
Since I do not use grub I am uncertain.
However, please comment if you know if it is done.
If so then it may be useful to have kernel-parameters.txt
also installed in /boot where the filesystem is expected
to be something that a bootloader can handle.
