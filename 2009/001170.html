xinetd only provides a few services by itself.
Many of them are probably disabled by default
and must have their conf file edited to enable them.

&gt;<i>.. were there other spells that configure themselves as xinetd services that
</I>&gt;<i> could be re-cast to clean it?
</I>
Most services that can be launched by xinetd
that also install a service configuration file for xinetd
usually have that service disabled by default.
Therefore, the installed file must be edited by the SA
in order to activate the service.


&gt;<i>&#160;why are services names missing from /etc/services?
</I>
Maybe it's IANA's fault?
Maybe it's software authors' fault by not following
the service names listed by IANA?
Take your pick.
Since I neither specify what services are official
nor write software that uses xinetd
I know that it is not my fault.  :)


&gt;<i>&#160;shouldn't having the default configuration files at
</I>&gt;<i> least make sure definitions for their respecitve services exist at
</I>&gt;<i> installation?
</I>
If I write the xinetd configuration file for the service
then usually it does appear in /etc/services
However, some of those I have not checked in years.
They may be obsolete or been given a new designation by IANA.

A box will automatically receive new /etc/services and /etc/protocols
that are downloaded from IANA and stuffed into a tarball at
the Sorcerer's website.
However, boxes that do not have the spells
&quot;services&quot; &quot;protocols&quot; installed
will not have those files updated.

Some SAs use custom /etc/services.
They expect that service to port translation is slow
and that /etc/services wastes memory.

536K 2009-05-02 19:49 /etc/services

Indeed 536K for some 5000 service to port number translations
is a bit excessive.

If a SA wants a service to run on a specific port
then a service name is not always required.
The SA could write the xinetd service file using
a port number instead.
Or at least that used to work if it no longer does.

The xinetd service files that we have control over
are those in the grimoire in directories
/root/.sorcery/grimoire/*.d/xinetd.d/
It is only about 30 files.

Feel free to fix them up and commit the changes to svn if you want.
It is a worth endeavor.
I could put it on my todo list.
But I still have the x86_64 I/R to complete compilation,
the IA32 I/R to complete compilation,
updates,
the port of the IA32 to uClibc to complete.
Only 300+ more spells to compile to complete the new port.
So far so good.
Looks like I am done cross-compiling
and have enough of a base system to natively compile
for the i586-linux-uclibc target.
And although sorcery can help me do most of the work,
I still have to watch it like a hawk due to little things,
such as me forgetting to compile functionality into uClibc
that is required by some spell casting
or if something requiring glibc should be invoked during
compilation and incur a segfault, etc...
gettext has me a bit worried.
However, it has so many requirements to compile first,
before I can compile it.
I might yet have to think of a way to step around that.

I saw something interesting today.
A CPU overheated.
And the error messages were exactly what I would expect for a glibc break.
It surprised me since it happened during a copy command
and there was no way the command could break the hosts's glibc.
As expected, after I cooled it off and replaced the heatsink's fan
the box booted without problems.
No glibc break afterall.

I still expect to have to replace that heatsink and fan again,
because the fan I attached to the old heatsink would not turn
when I attached it properly.
So I tried to screw it on upside down.
Turns great now.
But not sure if it cools that good.  :)
Funny, huh?

Hope everyone is having a good week.
