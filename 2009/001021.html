</I>backup feature was because long time ago sorcery was not stable enough 
for my own usage.... I crashed the box several times without backup to 
restore and then had to preform a whole install... however this don't 
appears to be the case now (more than 1 year without reinstall...)
&gt;<i> I tend to expect that the SA or SAs that requested it did

</I>&gt;<i> This is what happens when an idea
</I>&gt;<i> is not carefully considered prior to implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> It creates something that is confusing, difficult, and probably less

</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, I am removing it.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>well we discussed long time though... ;)
for preserve I've no idea about what it was doing.... backup was 
creating incremental backup of the system to allow an emergency recovery 
using simply tar
then with a small subset of statically linked apps you could still boot 
on the system and restore it...
&gt;<i> The following will be the current rules regarding most files in /etc/
</I>&gt;<i> The rules below do not apply to files in /etc/{gconf,sorcery,init.d}/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When a spell is dispelled,
</I>&gt;<i> it's modified files from /etc/
</I>&gt;<i> are transferred to /etc.sav/
</I>&gt;<i> where only /etc.sav/ renames /etc/
</I>&gt;<i> This way after the the updated spell finishes installing
</I>&gt;<i> modified /etc/ files can be transferred back into /etc/
</I>&gt;<i> Convenient, yes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The original /etc/ files for spells are now installed in both
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/ and also /etc.ori/
</I>&gt;<i> This way diffing a modified and original /etc/ file
</I>&gt;<i> is as easy as executing the diff command.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, /etc.ori/ is a bit non standard.
</I>&gt;<i> And so is /etc.sav/
</I>&gt;<i> However, these aught to give SAs
</I>&gt;<i> greater convenience than the choice between
</I>&gt;<i> a preserve and backup rules.
</I>&gt;<i> And most boxes have plenty of space to nearly replicate /etc/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The files in /etc.ori/ are merely for SA convenience.
</I>&gt;<i> They have no checksums.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, removing them should not create problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although not /etc/ files,
</I>&gt;<i> all files installed in /usr/doc/ /usr/share/doc/ /usr/share/locale/LC_MESSAGES/
</I>&gt;<i> can also be removed anytime.
</I>&gt;<i> No CPU cycles or disk wear and tear is wasted on
</I>&gt;<i> checking the content of files that are often unessential.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did someone ask how to reconfigure all the installed spells on a Sorcerer box.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # rm /etc/sorcery/log/config/*/sorcery /etc/sorcery/log/opt.{on,off}/*
</I>&gt;<i> # cast --deps $( augur installed )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I have not tried it.
