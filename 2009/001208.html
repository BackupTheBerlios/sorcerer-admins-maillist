<PRE>I appreciate that.

However, I am still going after tiny bugs.
Everyone has probably read the warnings from module-init-tools.
The current stable release no longer wants /etc/modprobe.conf
and requires all files in /etc/modprobe.d/ to have a .conf extension.
So I removed /etc/modprobe.conf from the installation
of module-init-tools.
It looked good.
Then I saw on a run of /etc/init.d/initramfs
a message from find about
/etc/modprobe.conf missing
While the message did not effect the outcome
of updating the initramfs I knew that someone
would eventually report it.
And thus I adjusted the initramfs update script.

At the moment I am in the process of doing a full install
of the IA32 I/R and it is copy and unarchiving files.
Although I carefully inspected the code involving UUIDs
nothing seemed incorrect about it.
And since I am using merely a single partition for the install
there is no chance for a mix-up on this test run.
However, if the test is successful I will test it again
with a more complicated setup, and using ext4 instead of ext3 also.

The previous 2 times I did a full install test I ran into problems.
First, I omitted binutils-v2.18 from the I/R since I knew it would
only be required if glibc was recompiled.
However, glibc-locales requires glibc and therefore inherits
the requirement on binutils-v2.18
Therefore, that omission was not a good idea.

And a time before or after that I discovered that tar
now automatically escapes spaces in file names and thus,
was generating an error code return when archiving atk and ustr.
Therefore, atk and ustr were missing from the archive cache on the I/R
Consequently, ELF failures happened while cast was run.
And of course the box was lacking atk and ustr sources.
Needless to say I aborted the installation and went looking
for the reason what those archives were not included on the I/R

As you can tell these are errors that would merely annoy Sorcerer SAs,
but not impede the installation of someone who strongly desired Sorcerer.
But still these are problems that are obvious, easily spotted, and
should be fixed before an I/R is released for general consumption.

Considering all the possibilities for problems that exist with I/Rs
the I/Rs that I am testing are in very good condition.
But they are not yet perfect.
I can detect, smote, and retry a new I/R candidate about 3 times in a day.
So eventually we will have a winner.
But for the moment there is naught but the mundane process of
hacking away at the bugs until they are gone.

Because many of the bug solutions involve modification of spells
the person who can do this fastest is probably me.
Otherwise the spot and solution to a bug encountered during testing
would take about 2 days.
3 bugs a day is faster progress than 1 bug per 2 days.
Also I am making the same fixes in parallel on the x86_64 I/R
Basically the module-init-tools and subsequent initramfs problem
occur both on the IA32 and x86_64 I/Rs.

While it has probably never actually happened.
I would like to produce an absolute perfect bugless I/R.
But it will probably still have a bug lurking somewhere.
They are so sneaky, afterall.
And that is when I will require feedback to help find and fix those bugs
so they do not become part of the next set of I/Rs released.
Sometimes if serious bugs are reported during the first week
I will be able to rush out new I/Rs.
If I do a massive update of the grimoire
then it might not be remain possible
since I would be waiting an indeterminable amount of time
for the x86_64 I/R to catch up on compilation.

Currently, while testing the new I/R
I am searching for the cause of xf86-video-i810's compilation failure.
I suspect that the problem is related to libpciaccess.
The new version of xorg-server requires libpciaccess
And the last time xf86-video-i810 was compiled
libpciaccess was not installed.
It may be that the xorg-server 1.5.3 is not compatible with
xf86-video-i810 which seems unexpected since the
version of xorg-server that was installed when xf86-video-i810
was last compiled was 1.4 and I am trying to compile the
most recently released xf86-video-i810 source.
And the last successful compile of xf86-video-i810 was the 1.7.4 release.

The release of xorg related tarballs could not be any more confusing!
This is why I do not like updating xorg related spells in between
major xorg release events.
xf86-video-i810 no longer compiles and I do not know what spell
version should be adjusted in what direction.
I suppose I will try a newer xorg-server version next
since I already tried the latest libpciaccess.
But using xorg-server &gt; 1.5.x may cause ATI's or NVIDIA's
pre-compiled drivers to not work.
So I will risk it and try it anyway.

Fortunately, since all Sorcerer I/Rs come with pre-compiled xorg drivers
SAs will not be burdened by this problem at the moment.
However, I want to resolve it because I must compile i810 drivers
for the uclibc port.
If anyone has a recent successful compile for xf86-video-i810
then please send me a snapshot for it:
/var/log/sorcery/snap/xf86-video-i810.gz
