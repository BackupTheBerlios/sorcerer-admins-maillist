<PRE>Two poppler libraries should be installed
one is in /opt/kde4/
the other is in /usr/

Generally, KDE programs know where to find their libraries.
Generally, I would not expect a problem from a KDE
program linking with the poppler in /usr/
instead of the one in /opt/kde4/
That is because almost all KDE4 executables
and libraries should contain an RPATH to /opt/kde4/lib/

Adding /opt/kde4/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf
should not be required.
There is a slim chance that it could cause problems,
but that is extremely unlikely.
At worst it should slow down dynamic linking and
updating of /etc/ld.so.conf slightly.

The problem you saw might also be because
I recently rolled back the version of poppler.
The newer stable version of poppler has a problem
It failed to install poppler-layer.h
and it includes that in poppler.h
That is a serious omission.
I expect that the software authors missed it,
because the newer poppler included a cmake build method.
The cmake build and install methods is probably not
properly tested as is often the case when a software project
introduces cmake support into the source tree.
Consequently, the software authors probably only tested
the autotools method of compilation and installation
and decided that the new poppler was good to go.
Yet perhaps the problem with the cmake build method
will be fixed in the near future.
For the time being I have no problem sitting on it
and using the old version rather than write a custom
build for poppler spells.

As far as I am concerned the newer stable version of poppler
is not yet suitable for use.
However, having several other installed software projects
re-install to deal with the change in the poppler library
is a bit of a waste.
But I did not design it that way.
sorcery only does what sorcery must do.
