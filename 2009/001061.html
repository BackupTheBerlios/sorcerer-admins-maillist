<PRE>Seems as if there is a NFS related problem with the newer kernel.
rpc.nfsd will hang shutdown.
startup of NFS might not work properly either.
I suspect that the recently reported shutdown hangs of Sorcerer are NFS related.
I am still investigating.

/etc/init.d/rpc.nfsd appears to hang during boot also.
However, on most boxes it will be the last init-script run
during the runlevel startup.
Most SAs will not notice it hanging.
Because virtual terminals are made available for login
prior to runlevel execution the hang during boot
does not deny login like it would on other distributions.


rpcbind: server localhost not responding, timed out
RPC: failed to contact local rpcbind server (errno 5).


Plenty repeats of those above two lines in the system log and kernel buffers.

This might be due to several possibilities.

1. did not compile rpcbind with tcpwrappers support
2. misconfigured the linux kernel leaving out something essential.
3. bug in new linux kernel
4. bug in new rpcbind
5. bug in new nfs-utils

I tried recompile rpcbind with tcp_wrappers support.
Still no luck.
rpcinfo indicates the box is not running an rpc server
when rpcbind is running in server mode.

The box used to be able to do NFSv4.
Best guess is that the linux kernel is misconfigured or buggy.

No problems when rebooting to an older kernel.
I checked the difference in the configs.
The newer kernel has
CONFIG_SUNRPC_REGISTER_V4=y
while the older kernel does not.

rpcbind should support rpcbind protocol version 4 as required for
CONFIG_SUNRPC_REGISTER_V4

It is an experimental feature.
However, I am uncertain how to disable it without compiling an
entirely new kernel and modules.
There may be a kernel module parameter that might circumvent this?

Unless nobody has an idea about this,
I am going to compile a linux without that
experimental feature and see if the problem goes away.
This will take about a day to test.
Meanwhile, please provide more information and potential workarounds/solutions
as they occur to you.




In other non related news...
if /boot is full while initramfs images are created
then the box will probably not be able to reboot properly.
Had that happen recently.
Be sure to check that there is adequate space on /boot
The initramfs init-script does not have a graceful recovery
method for handling an out of space error involving /boot.
In that situation rebooting with an Install/Rescue disk to
manually fix the problem is a must.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

I was reading grub2 and hurd documentation today.
Both are interesting reading, of course.
However, neither would one want to run on production boxes.
Please do not take my word for it.
Read the docs at their websites if you are interested.

Although not practical, I would imagine it would be fun to run
a box with hurd, uClibc, busybox, and grub instead of
linux, glibc, coreutils, and lilo, respectively.
Such a box would be fast in some respects,
but fail our expectations when we needed it most.
And statically linked busybox utilities are incredibly fast.
Even makes poorly written shell scripts run fast.  :)
