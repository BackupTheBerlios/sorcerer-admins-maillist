<PRE>Hi,
long time ago I discussed about that.... I know that some of you don't 
see difference between both... I see lot of differences and would like 
to have 2 requirements in spells :
 - build requirements are what is mandatory to build the spell, not to 
run it, a build requirement can be removed from the system without 
causing a crash, however it has to be present on build
 - run requirements is what is mandatory to run without a crash

why do I come back?
I want to use core spell to build automaticaly and usb rescue drive 
using what is on drive, looking at the graph I provided I saw lot of 
spells that aren't mandatory for running the rescue disc, like cmake 
that cause gcc-v4.1 to be installed as well.... AFAIK gcc-v4.1 and cmake 
can be rebuild from gcc... so they don't have to be on the rescue disk
as well there is a difference when doing crosscompiling (and this is one 
of the reason I couldn't go further on crosscompiling) because a build 
requirement is a software that have to be run on host, then have to be 
compiled for host arch and then should not be put on target FS....

as well I find strange that some spell have dependencies upon autotools 
(automake and autoconf) since all autotooled package have a pecular 
version of autotools built-in.... thoses spells are only required if you 
want to create a software that use autotools, else you don't require 
them normaly

best regards
JLM
