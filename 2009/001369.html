<PRE>I discovered recently that linux version 2.6.31.6 turns my wireless
USB NIC into a paperweight.
I spent an embarrassingly long amount of time trying to debug the problem
as if it were a udev problem instead of being caused by the newer kernel.
The module I am using is at76c50x_usb.
Please expect it if you use that.
I have no idea if the problem is limited to only that module.

After a good examining of udev I learned two interesting things.
First, it can load firmware.
However, it does not seem to want to do so successfully during boot.
I have the feeling that this is something like a domino effect
where something else going wrong before it causes the failure later.
After booting I can restart udevd, unload the module, pull out the usb cord
and stuff the usb cord back into the case and then udev has no problem
with loading the module and firmware together.
Another solution that works even better is to rmmod the module
then modprobe the module.
It is rather annoying.
The problem appears to be caused by udev.

udev 147 was completely unsuable for booting.
udev 146 is the version currently listed as stable in the grimoire.
If an older version of udev worked better than 146
then I no longer remember which one.
So for the moment we are at the mercy of udev development
which reminds me of guys with lit cigarettes playing tag using
super-soakers filled with gasoline.
We might be lucky if no boxes go up in flames,
due to bugs in udev.

I am posting this information to the list so that SAs will know
to be extra careful with testing their boxes following updates.
I do what I can to test, but even I discover some things the hard way.

Also someone mentioned new problems involving audio following
the update to the 2.6.31.6 kernel.
I also noticed that aumix was not loading and that
/dev/mixer did not exist.
I suppose that might be due to an inadequate linux .config, however:

# LC_ALL=C grep MIX .config
CONFIG_MIXCOMWD=m
CONFIG_SND_MIXER_OSS=m
CONFIG_SND_MIXART=m

So it looks as if it aught to work.
My impression is that both udev and linux stable releases
have become less reliable.
Please be careful and boot an older kernel
if something odd is happening with the newer kernel.

</PRE>
