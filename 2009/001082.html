</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... AFAIK gcc-v4.1 and cmake
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be rebuild from gcc... so they don't have to be on the rescue disk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as well there is a difference when doing crosscompiling (and this is one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the reason I couldn't go further on crosscompiling) because a build
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requirement is a software that have to be run on host, then have to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compiled for host arch and then should not be put on target FS....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anything did require something that required something
</I>&gt;<i> that required something that required cmake and cmake required gcc-v4.1
</I>&gt;<i> then the compilation of that end something would also require gcc-v4.1
</I>&gt;<i> to be installed.
</I>
WRONG!
make require gcc to be build, any spell that use make don't obligatory
require gcc
there are tons of such exemple, almost one for every code generator,
flex, yacc.....

build and runtime are by essence different, you might need to have a
code generator like yacc to create a file that will eventualy be
compiled and stored into a library.... why all the user that link to
this library will depend on yacc? AFAIK only this spell require it...
once build it will no more ever be used, NOT EVEN FOR COMPILING
same with make (appart hugin for example that will use it at run time)


&gt;<i> Therefore, the requirement chains must be without broken links
</I>&gt;<i> when it comes to having installed software.
</I>&gt;<i> This is especially important when it comes to doing any compilation
</I>&gt;<i> of software during the installation of the I/R.
</I>&gt;<i> Since the network is not yet configured by the SA
</I>&gt;<i> new source tarballs can not simply be downloaded as required.
</I>&gt;<i> All that are available on the I/R is all that can be compiled.
</I>
a compile requirement is composed of 2 things :
- build requirements
- runtime requirements

a function like CreateRescue() would look like

CreateRescue()
{
      leech $(augur runtime_aarof core) $(augur build_aarof core)
      copySourcesToCache $(augur runtime_arof core) $(augur build_arof core)
      copyArchivesToCache $(augur runtime_arof core) $(augur build_arof core)
      makeImage $(augur runtime core)
}

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as well I find strange that some spell have dependencies upon autotools
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (automake and autoconf) since all autotooled package have a pecular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version of autotools built-in.... thoses spells are only required if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to create a software that use autotools, else you don't require
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them normaly
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some sources do require libtool or autoconf or automake installed.
</I>&gt;<i> Many sources have enough in their tree to compile without having
</I>&gt;<i> the above 3 spells installed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are two reasons that Sorcerer has only required and optional spells
</I>&gt;<i> and not build required and run-time required spells.
</I>&gt;<i> The first reason is simplicity.
</I>&gt;<i> The current system is simple and fast.
</I>&gt;<i> Because it does not try to do anything complicated
</I>&gt;<i> it tends to work properly.
</I>&gt;<i> If it were to do fancy stuff
</I>&gt;<i> then unanticipated problems could occur.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second reason is that Sorcerer boxes must update.
</I>&gt;<i> Because Sorcerer boxes update there is a good chance
</I>&gt;<i> that over time every installed spell will recompile.
</I>&gt;<i> If nearly all the installed software will recompile
</I>&gt;<i> then the build requirements will be needed again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is not normally a good reason to have
</I>&gt;<i> spells required only for compilation to not be installed.
</I>&gt;<i> Let us examine gcc and make for examples.
</I>&gt;<i> Feel free to dispel them.
</I>&gt;<i> A box does not require thme to run.
</I>&gt;<i> But if a box lacks archives for them
</I>&gt;<i> then what will will be required when it is time to update?
</I>&gt;<i> Almost nothing can cast without gcc installed.
</I>
That's why gcc is a CORE spell like libc.... almost everything can be
rebuild from them....
however that's a waste to have cmake installed and scons... look at
the few spells that are using them
on a sorcerer box almost 70% of spells will be used once a year... and
will be installed 365 day a year....

&gt;<i> What can parase makefiles if make is not installed?
</I>&gt;<i> Allowing SAs to dispel gcc and make is not a convenience.
</I>&gt;<i> It is a delayed super head-ache!
</I>
NO, core profile is there to ensure that core spell ie spell that will
brake sorcery installation will ever been present, because thoses
spells are requirements of sorcery

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They day will come when they say,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Oh that was dumb, why did I dispel gcc?
</I>&gt;<i> I require it now for updates.
</I>&gt;<i> I have to manually install it from the I/R
</I>&gt;<i> Oh wait, that is an older gcc.
</I>&gt;<i> Now I have to compile it again.
</I>&gt;<i> At least my c++ programs did not quit starting,
</I>&gt;<i> thanks to the libstdc++ libraries stored in the library cache.
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, I installed the older gcc provided on the I/R.
</I>&gt;<i> Great.
</I>&gt;<i> But now my c++ program will not run due to missing symbols.
</I>&gt;<i> They require the newer libstdc++ provided by the newer gcc.
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, I have to compile gcc first before I can do anything.
</I>&gt;<i> I wish I had just left it installed to begin with.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even if SAs could save 300M on a installed system
</I>
300M?!? you're kiding! linux is made for developpers! and what do
developpers like? development tools of course! look at perl, python,
ruby, java, yacc, byacc, bison..... how many time are theses tools
used a year? to be frank on my 9G / partition I use 7G and I'm almost
certain that I can discard 4G of them without even carring...
my box use xfce, fluxbox, and few other binaries that will weight at
most 100M, ok there are dependencies... a typical xubuntu cdrom is
650M _EVERYTHING_BUILD_ ie with lot of tools, the runtime env is only
650M (by the way this is my average memory usage... strange isn't it?)
this means that on my 7G partition, I only require 650M to run the
system... the rest... is only for building
however as you mentioned bellow sorcery as lot of advantages upon
binary based distro and I won't swap to binary based distro because I
know the asle of LinuxFromScratch when you use such distro (it always
miss some header... or library archive... or yadayada)

&gt;<i> by being able to dispel build only requirements
</I>&gt;<i> they would soon come to regret the decision
</I>&gt;<i> for blowing big holes that must be repaired
</I>&gt;<i> before the box can update properly again.
</I>
THAT'S their problem! to be franck nothing prevent me to do
augur install gcc | xargs rm

or rm -rf /var/cache and try to cast without network.....

sorcery won't ever prevent me to do that...

sorcery only warrants that
1) on cast all needed software will be present
2) the installation will be safe

the changes required on sorcery and spell is really low compared to
the possibilities
you always complain about taking time to recompile x86_64 software on
qemu... yes qemu is great... but as all emulation it's slow!
why do you think that most of the time developers use cross-compilers?
 cross compiling isn't an easy setup, but once set crosscompile is a
boon because you can use plain power of the system... however not all
will crosscompile fine and the env shall be enough robust
same the problem with crosscompile is that it require 2 level of
dependencies, build dependencies that will be provided by crosscompile
host, and runtime requirements that will be provided by the target fs
and that won't run on the host (can be for example arm binaries...)

&lt;....&gt;

&gt;<i> I hate to seem so uncompromising about it.
</I>&gt;<i> However, having separate concepts of build and
</I>&gt;<i> runtime requirements is something borrowed from
</I>&gt;<i> pre-compiled binary based distros.
</I>
WRONG, it is a concept that is mandatory when creating a rescue disk,
as well as when crosscompiling.... as explained before...
same it could even be used to provide chrooted installs....
imagine that you could install without having to use a 3rd party lib
to track changes on filesystem, and that this install is performed
into a chrooted env? how can you perform that? hummm what if in build
requirements I have install and gcc.... what do I need to perform
install step? well in fact only what is in build requirement, simply
copy them to some dir, do chroot to this dir and perform the install.
after that clean the dir by removing all file copied and you have a
perfect safe install... it works even on systems that don't support
DESTDIR....
same for crosscompiling, some host binaries has to be present during
the install step, however to prevent having a missbehaving spell
overwrite the host binaries with target binaries, the install shall be
performed in a chroot jail with only a minimal copy of mandatory BUILD
tools....
sorcerer is a source based distro, this means that it shall permit all
what is allowed by such distro : COMPILE, and even crosscompile...

even with this actual design of sorcerer won't warants that some
missbehaving source will not modify some files outside it's source
tree during compilation time, and since tracking can't be activated
all time because of slowness, if some spell do modification before
prepare_install it won't be tracked... hopefully by activating md5sums
you can be on the safe side... most of the time... imaging that glibc
has a bug during install and create an empty /lib/libc.so? ahaha I
wonder how will your box will behave....
