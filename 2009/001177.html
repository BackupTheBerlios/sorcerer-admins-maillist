We owe thanks to uClibc for being very compatible with glibc.
I discovered a recent compile error with device-mapper,
and perhaps adjusting the uClibc configuration will avoid it.
Mostly adjusting uClibc configuration and spells are
all that has been necessary to keep the port compiling.


&gt;<i> I noticed there was a libdrm update or something today, and I decided to yet

</I>&gt;<i> long story, you don't want to know )
</I>
Seemed like the linux-headers mandated the MesaLib update
which mandated the libdrm udpate, and so forth...
I was updating available stable versions for spells
just to keep it all compiled.
The new versions are not necessarily unstable,
but they are not was specified part of the last xorg release.
And xorg releases happen even less frequently than
Sorcerer I/R releases.


&gt;<i> Anyways, with everything in unstable, this intel graphics-enabled laptop now

</I>
Actually, I did not expect that all the individual graphics drivers
would adjust smoothly to the other updates.
However, I expected to deal with it soon since the
uClibc port is recompiling everything that ELF linked with glibc.

The update was compatible with the pre-compiled drivers provided by NVIDIA.
However, I expect that there may still be a bug in the newer
MesaLib or libdrm, because I experienced one graphic lockup
while running an OpenGL program.
I sshed in from outside, killed the process and regained control.


&gt;<i> I might actually try doom3 on it once I get home next month. :)
</I>
Even though it might be doomed to fail?
Also there is the problem of providing the necessary
glibc linked 32 bit ELF libraries to run it.


&gt;<i> In all seriousness, if uClibc is markedly faster in executing programs, I
</I>&gt;<i> might be interested in getting a copy once an I/R for that is ready. I
</I>&gt;<i> suppose that this will hopefully be the smallest I/R of the Sorcerer range?
</I>
It can be.
But design and effort is required to integrate busybox.
Also I must begin testing with lzip to see about replacing
all the 7za compressed archives on the I/R
with lzip compressed archives.


&gt;<i> -Evert-
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. I am slightly glad now that I have an intel chip in my laptop, as it
</I>&gt;<i> means I'll get the same if not better video accell on uClibc.

Not certain if X11 and OpenGL will be faster for using uClibc.
Graphics rather than libc functions involving libc,
will probably not gain a boost from transitioning to uClibc.
That least that is my guess.
Running a game, for example, would probably not have
processes constantly start such as when a source is compiled.
If ydoom3 source code can be acquired, compiled, and statically linked
that could provide some benefit.

I remember years ago the xmame team were
into squeezing every bit of performance possible.
Therefore, xmame executable was statically linked when possible.
Unfortunately, only the compiler can inline code.
Static linking still has function calls even for the smallest of functions
that are linked from a static archive.
Compilation of functions inline,
where the entire code of a function is inserted rather
than a call to the function,
can often increase performance at the expense of
increased code size.
However, inlining of functions that execute inside of a loop
is often an excellent performance benefit since
it skips all the stack play, pushing, popping, address, etc...

When creating the port uclibc port
I could probably have tried for
IA32 C programs compiled with -mregparm=3
I vaguely recollect that -mregparm=3 may be the default for C++ programs,
might be a default for the x86_64 port,
and might be a default for internal kernel functions.
However, I might be wrong about any or all of that.

According to the gcc manual page -mregparm=3 is a one way trip.
Everything must be compiled with it if it is to be used.
Otherwise libraries and executables might disagree about
how parameters should be passed to functions,
and thus do the wrong thing and runtime error.

If -mregparm=3 with gcc works okay,
which seems to be subject to a bit of debate,
then some programs might run faster and be
less bottled by the bus.

However, aside from the question of whether it works
the gcc manual page suggests that those parameters must be
given explicitly forever when compiling anything.
And some sources do not want to use CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS
environment variables.
Therefore, it gave me cause to wonder if it would turn into a pain.
I would not want to have to add it to the gcc spec file
or modify gcc source code to enforce it.
Also, I have not made enough time to play with -mregparm=3

Yet while it may provide some performance improvement,
the benefits are not entirely clear.
If a parameter to a function is not immediately used,
but the registers which hold the parameter must be used
then register content must go into memory
and thus probably have a spot on the stack allocated for it
which is the same as would happen as if the parameter was
passed to the function on the stack instead of in a register.

Oops, I went on a tangent.

Anyway, quality of code, especially execution speed,
is still 99% dependent on the programmer and 1% on compiler.
With all the nifty parameters gcc supports it might seem otherwise.
However, poorly written code still runs slow even with the best
gcc optimizations.  :)
