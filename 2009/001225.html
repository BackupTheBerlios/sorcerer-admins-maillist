<PRE>Someone was mentioning that there should be more checking
to ensure that services specified in xinetd configuration files
have entries also in /etc/services
So I did some checking.
So far I fixed the xinetd configuration files installed by heimdal.
Also those files will now install with services off
since kerberos 5 is required on almost every box,
yet is not usually implemented as the authentication method.

In addition I decided to make /etc/services work a bit more like
how SAs might expect it to work based upon other configuration files.

/etc/services.d/
is the directory that contains the files
that are concatenated into /etc/services

Also /etc/services is stripped of comments.
To read the comments, instead read or grep files in
/etc/services.d/
By elimination of the comments from /etc/services
the size of /etc/services has been reduced by half.
That will reduce memory consumption and
increase the speed at which services names to port numbers
and reverse inquiries are complete.
/etc/services is still huge!
203K
All this file is for is mapping textual names to TCP and UDP port numbes.
It is almost unbelievably large.
And of course 95% and more of the services listed in /etc/services
are services that are never used.

Anyway, I tend to get in the mood to do these last hour sweeping changes
right before releasing new I/R because I tend to see something that
I do not quite like, but am used to regularly ignoring.
:<i>)
</I>
The IA32 I/R should be ready very soon.
I have had two complete successful installs and reboot tests with it.
