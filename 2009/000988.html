<PRE>personaly I don't like modifying the mbr and for various reasons like 
having muliple IDEPENDANTS Os (a sorcerer x86_64, a i586 version and a 
widows) I don't want to have it installed on mbr
shoot the mbr and you shoot everything,
shoot the bootloader and you can't even switch to another os without 
trouble in case the bootloader is in first sector of partition just 
change the active partition and it'll work just fine....
if you have several os installed then all are running race condition 
about whom will write the mbr..... either you have to maintain all the 
configuration of all os to be certains they will keep track of the 
other, or just install the bootloader on 1rst sector and let they live 
their lives.... I can even update a i586 sorcerer from the x86_64 one 
without bothering ;)
anyway if grub has to be installed into mbr I will likely never use it....
look at the &quot;rescue usb disk&quot; I made, without lilo it wouldn't even 
exist or you will have to waste a full usb drive for having a small 
rescue disk, on this you have a lilo installed on boot sector of the 
partition, allowing to move it anywhere you want... on a sdcard, on an 
usb drive, on flash, on a harddrive.... it's STANDALONE

I think that lilo shall use 1rst partition block as default and optional 
mbr (for crapy filesystems that don't support having a boot sector) and 
shall use UUID by default (and not the old /dev/sd* or /dev/hd* or 
/dev/mmc* or.....) like this anywhere you go, whatever the physical 
medium of your drive, it will boot as expected
best regards

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry about big delay but there was a major setback on my home made new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server, it did not supported 8GB RAM (lousy Intel G41 chipset, grrr). I did
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make a ticket to manufacturer (=Asus), but it seems they support 8GB only

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> did not helped on my case. So, because 8GB was needed i did buy new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> motherboard (Asus P5Q Pro) and i have now server running.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Specs: Intel Q6600 Quad core CPU, Asus P5Q Pro motherboard, 8 GB memory kit,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3*750GB Samsung Spinpoint <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sorcerer-admins">F1 at Linux</A> software Raid-5. Main OS is installed on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> USB stick (Ubuntu Intrepid Ipex, eg. 8.10).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now the real problems, as Sorcerer uses lilo, its does not support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paravirtualization. I think GRUB is kinda must if paravirtualized system is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wanted to get booted.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What i encountered during installer that it was not possible to install lilo
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to MBR and when i did manually installed it, it did not booted, i did
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receive error messages but no workarounds available... Oh, virtualization
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technology was KVM.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Has anyone using GRUB with Sorcerer atm? I think if Sorcerer wants to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support virtualization it need to have also option to use GRUB, because what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i did search using google it does not look good, mostly all uses grub
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead lilo so there are not so much support using LILO.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Kyle, can we eg. if i like install Debian/Ubuntu or CentOS or some other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distro which i can boot using paravirtualized drivers or try to mess with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GRUB?
