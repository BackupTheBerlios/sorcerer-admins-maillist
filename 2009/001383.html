<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I know the feeling of testing a new version of udev
and discovering that the box incapable of completing sysinit
due to bugs in the new version of udev.
I would spare you that anguish if I could.
I spare myself the anguish by keeping
an untarred udev archive of a usable udev
within subdirectory /etc/udev.sav/
That way if the installed udev is ineffective
then I can boot with kernel parameter
rdinit=/bin/bash,
# cp /etc/udev.sav/* /
# exec /init
And resume booting the box.
That safety net does not seem like a good solution for a distribution
wide policy.
But I could not stop thinking that something must be done
to give the SA a way out of udev purgatory in the event
that the new version of udev fails during sysinit.
Of course booting with an Install/Rescue disk would provide a way out,
but even I do not like using that solution.
Therefore, I decided to try something different.

/init will now also create a list of loaded modules and a copy of /dev
and store that in /etc/coldplug/{dev/,modules} , respectively.
The reason for that is to try to obtain the end result of
having executed udevadm trigger,
yet without actually having to execute udevadm trigger.

Of course the problem with re-using a list of modules and
also a copy of /dev is that it might not be exactly the same
when a new kernel is booted or when installed hardware changes.
Therefore, the remembered coldplug information stored in
/etc/coldplug/ is only used in certain situations.

When fast booting using /boot/fast/{linux,initrf}
then the information in /etc/coldplug/
is used instead of doing udevadm trigger.
Why?
First, that initrf image contains only the modules that were loaded
when the fast boot initrf image was created.
Therefore, fast booting is incapable of handling hardware changes.
That makes sense, of course, because the price for speed
is knowing exactly what to do and assuming that there are no changes.

If doing a regular non fast booting with a fully populated initrf
then different modules can be loaded in response to hardware changes
and kernel module name changes.
Therefore, udevadm trigger remains the default method
for sysinit when booting from images such as:
/boot/2.6.32{linux,initrf}

However, if the installed udev is a unusable
then using stored information in /etc/coldplug/
might yet work.
Fortunately, that is possible and also easy to do.
Add to the kernel command line the parameter coldplug.
That will instruct scripts run during sysinit to use information in
/etc/coldplug/ instead of doing udevadm trigger if both
/etc/coldplug{dev,modules}
exist.

In summary the kernel parameter coldplug causes information
in /etc/coldplug/{dev,modules} to be used instead of running
udevadm trigger allowing udevd to handle coldplug events.
Also fast booting has the default method of booting
as if the kernel parameter coldplug was given.
Therefore, if a problem exists with this implementation
then please report it on the email list.
If a fast boot initrf image is unusable
then full boot images can still be used.
However, my intention was not to ruin the potential for fast booting.

Fast booting using /etc/coldplug/{dev,modules} seems faster
than previous fast booting using udevadm trigger.
Basically it invokes modprobe about 100 times to load all modules.
But that is not as slow as it should seem.
And on boxes that reach the full 180 second timeout for udevadm settle
then fast booting will definitely be faster.

Please make a note about the kernel command line parameter coldplug.
The kernel ignores it, but the Sorcerer init-scripts
that run during sysinit will look for it.
It could provide a quick way out an unbootable mess
caused by a udev update.

After updating with a version 2009-351 grimoire
the changes described in this email will go into effect.
And if you have any ill premonitions about the update
then please use that as an excuse to update backups first.  :)
