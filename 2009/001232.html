</I>
How odd.
UUIDs are not suppose to change.
They are supposed to be assigned only once.


&gt;<i> Ill look more into it this week , but as long as I don't update the
</I>&gt;<i> kernel everything else seems to be peachy.
</I>
Thanks, I would appreciate more information about it please.


&gt;<i> As for on screen feedback , I'm talking as to what populates TTY1
</I>&gt;<i> after booting into the system when you sit on the login screen . How
</I>&gt;<i> can I change that to display on TTY12 ?
</I>
All output from sysinit is directed to a non console tty.
All output from the runlevel is directed to a different non console tty.
If anything still scrolls on console
then it probably wrote to console
or wrote at a loglevel that permits
the kernel to write the the message to console and/or all active ttys


&gt;<i> And the install only takes me about 19 minutes of the base install .
</I>&gt;<i> Super nice .
</I>
Much longer for me.  :)
But it should install a bit faster for using lzip instead of p7zip
for compression of the archives.
On that 4G box chances are after the archives are copied from CDROM
they remain in the kernel cache for faster unarchiving to the real root /


&gt;<i> Possible to get more debugging info from augur in the future ie;
</I>&gt;<i> running augur easy and it saying &quot; nothing to update &quot; or along those
</I>&gt;<i> lines , but doesn't show any attempt to connect ( my network wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> connected ). I know it sounds bad but for future to have a message
</I>&gt;<i> populate showing that the network might be down or automatically try
</I>&gt;<i> to bring eth0 or wlan0 up ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just a suggestion .
</I>
Please write a wrapper for that.
Many years ago I permitted leech to start PPP connections
when required in order to do downloading.
However, for simplicity the tools today do only those aspects
related to the configuration and installation of software.


&gt;<i> Again thanks for the iso , was an early xmas present .
</I>
With as long as the x86_64 I/R requires to update
it might be until xmas until there is another.


&gt;<i> When the 64bit iso is ready ill get testing on that as well ;)
</I>
It is ready.
