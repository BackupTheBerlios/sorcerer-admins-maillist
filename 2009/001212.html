<PRE>I made it so that sorcery does not invoke the regeneration scripts in
/etc/init.d/
automatically from cast, while casting when booted from the I/R.
Perhaps in the past, a SA too anxious to complete casting might have
ended the chroot too soon and that might have been the reason why
some SAs ended up with boxes where lilo was not installed or
the initramfs was not properly regenerated.

Now, following the completion of cast during the installation
the regeneration scripts are invoked directly from the installer
and run in the foreground so that the completion of those tasks
are waited for before ending the chroot and unmounting
virtual filesystems that were bound into the install filesystem.
With this change proper symlink generation in /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/
will be correct, the initramfs will be correct, and lilo will have
been installed.

I apologize for not having realized that as a possible potential for
causing a failed installation previously.

This morning I discovered something interesting.
The x86_64 qemu box was lzipping 400+ archives.
At first I could not imagine how they became unlzipped.
In fact they had not.
sorcery-clean, which I forgot to modify to support files with extension .lz,
had wiped /var/cache/archive/ hours earlier.
Therefore, all the archives in /var/cache/archive/ had been recently tarred.
That bug will be fixed in the next grimoire tarball release.
I already commit the fix to svn.

Consequently, today begins yet another day of testing,
which might be more like a half day since my workstation
is busy lziping tarballs.
Still I hope to have some new very clean and very reliable I/Rs
available as soon as they pass testing.

Thanks for your patience and bug reporting.
