<PRE>For various reasons it was semi-broken for a few months.
Yes, I know that sucks.
But sometimes a few steps forward requires one step back.
Fortunately, it seems to be working better now.
Sorry about the inconvenience.

With the exception of bug fixes and changes required for the latest
2009 I/R release
I have not made any major changes to sorcery.
If all things stay the same Sorcerer in 2009 will probably be a sleepy year
with mostly just updated versions of software in the grimoire.

There is still no consensus and clear design of how repositories
should be handled.
Fortunately, there are still very few spells that acquire sources from
repositories instead of tarballs.

Although I do have a spell for downloading glibc 2.9 from repository
I intend to keep on using our current version of glibc for as long as
it remains practical.
That we can can allow maximum time for software developers and glibc authors
to do battle about who owns what bug and why.

There is currently no consensus about how networking should be improved.

Documentation for Sorcerer has not appreciably changed
in spite of small improvements that I attempted during 2008.
Maybe for lack of wanting to do any new sorcery development
I will review and revise documentation.
It seems unlike that the grimoire spell definition
will be entirely changed in 2009 as it was during 2008.
But who can tell yet, right?

Sorcery speed is good.
The index is reliable.
Downloading and compilation works as expected.

As usual please report bugs concerning grimoire spells
or if the sorcery tools do unexpected things.
Nothing unexpected seems to happen anymore.  So boring, I know.

However, the latest 2009 I/Rs have a new main menu which is long and
intimidating.
I only did basic installation and boot tests for IA32 and x86_64 I/Rs
and also tested the new boot menu for enhanced rescuing of boxes.
Other aspects of the Sorcerer installer might not all work.
If you find a bug please report it.
That will give me an excuse to fix it and release new I/Rs  :)
If there is nothing wrong
then we will probably continue using the new 2009 I/Rs for a very long time.

</PRE>
