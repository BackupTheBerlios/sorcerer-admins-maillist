</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have nothing against using grub.
</I>&gt;<i> Someone who uses grub should write the support for it.
</I>
Will look into it, but can i use your help if i try to write grub spell to 
Sorcerer?
Migth be too big job to me to get it running...

&gt;<i> I use lilo.
</I>&gt;<i> That is why the initramfs support and integration with lilo is 
</I>excellent.
&gt;<i> Unlike grub that must be installed in the MBR
</I>&gt;<i> lilo can be installed both in boot blocks or the MBR.
</I>
I dont find it bad that GRUB uses MBR, because i dont have any problems to 
dual-boot with it, it can boot your Windowses too, this machine which i 
write this message has GRUB on MBR and it can boot my XP ok, and my laptop 
with GRUB on MBR can boot my Vista OK, no problems. 

&gt;<i> It is true that I do not present an option about where to install lilo
</I>&gt;<i> in the menu driven installer.
</I>&gt;<i> It selects the boot block of /boot if /boot is definied
</I>&gt;<i> or the boot block of /
</I>
My partition table was /dev/hda1 = / and /dev/hda2 = swap, nothing else.

Hmm, it did not installed to MBR, i uses I/R to boot installed system and 
modified lilo.conf, oh, there was no lilo.conf, i used lilo.conf.fast and 
constructed lilo.conf using that, just added boot = /dev/hda and root = 
/dev/hda1, then i was able to boot (as fully virtualized). Please check 
installer that indeed its possible to install lilo to MBR because when i 
did it last night it was not succesfully installed, might be that it did 
go to /dev/hda1, but why there was no lilo.conf on my /etc ? 

And still, booting Sorcerer as paravirtualized is some thing that i don't 
know howto do it.

First you get this error from lilo if you try to install it to 
paravirtualized block device (/dev/vda):
Fatal: Linux experimental device 0x04x needs to be defined.
Check 'man lilo.conf' under 'disk=' and 'max-partitions='

And when you manually do edit disk= and max-partitions to get it installed 
i am getting Keytable read / checksum error. Might be also KVM related bug 
with LILO, nothing todo with LILO but with KVM but that effectively is 
blocking booting it as paravirtualized... Will try to look this again with 
current Sorcerer I/R, those errors where with previous version. Previous 
version did have some wierd problems with its installer running under KVM 
but this current I/R seems to be working pretty much stable under KVM, 
though KVM might to be blame, its not so production ready...:)

Btw new I/R is way better than previous one, grats on that. I did find it 
more comfortable to use than previous one and it did worked more stable 
ways than previous one. Good job.
