Uhmm.. cause I think tcpwrappers is enabled by default on most
packages that want to use it?   I didn't puposefully select it.

</I>
Monotone.  (monotone.ca) ... it uses boost and Botan. (I think this is
more a fault of the Botan maintainers than anything... the CPU I'm
using actually doesn't say 'opteron' but is a 64bit processor
anyhow... so it's setup scripts for configure.pl that it uses is just
making bad assumptions....

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am reasonably certain that the networking templates

</I>&gt;<i> both multiple IPv4 and IPv6 address if desired.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm not sure what the IP is being set for 'eth0' as first... the first
IP address in the list is set on device eth0:0... but yes it looks
like the lists of IP are working very well... but that doesn't address
setting the hardware address :)

Oh - but - dhcpd - the server for DHCP, doesn't like my
configuration... there is no IPv4 on ETH0, and it is only checking
eth0 and eth1... when I specify eth0:0:1 (which is the interface with
the real IP I want to serve DHCP from) it says there's no subnet or
that it has no ipv4 address..., or it's not broadcast enabled... I
gave up looking at it for a bit... I don't get it.  It's the same
configuration which was just working on my prior gateway....

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (My cable company has the hw addr of my card registered, and this new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> box, being the new gateway, needed to emulate the old address - well,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> guess I could call them and say that I had to replace it and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> re-register the new IP *shrug* )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They know the MAC address of the previous card?
</I>&gt;<i> It might be possible to change the MAC address of a card
</I>&gt;<i> or fake a different one, perhaps?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
ipconfig hw ether 00:00:blah

&gt;&gt;<i> oh - and dhclient, for some reason, doesn't seem to work, so I had to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> re-order the detect of dhcpcd and dhclient in functions... I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know why it doesn't work, but it just sits there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I vaguely recall Jan pointing out that dhclient must be started
</I>&gt;<i> during runlevels instead of during sysinit.
</I>&gt;<i> I forgot exactly why.
</I>&gt;<i> Or maybe that was some other program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Other than that this has gone very smoothly. &#160;I now have a amd x64 box
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as my gateway with quite a bit of extra space (if you need a build
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> site)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am always at a lack of x86_64 CPU power.
</I>&gt;<i> I am currently awaiting the outcome of an linux-modular
</I>&gt;<i> compile on qemu-system-x86_64
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
:<i>) linux-modular still takes like 20 minutes to build... but it's not
</I>utterly horrible :)... I can set you up with an account soon - it's
not quite stable yet (I'm not sure if rebooting will come back up yet)
