<PRE>I did multiple installation and reboot tests with the new I/Rs
They pass.
I even discovered an odd race condition between when
/dev is moved from /dev to /media/root/dev
and I corrected that with a tiny sleep statement.
Everyone already knows that I hate making booting
any slower than absolutely necessary.
But it was very odd when the chrooted
mount -a failed because the previous mount --move command
was not yet completed by the kernel.

As I am writing this email I am uploading the new I/Rs
They aught to be ready for download by or before Jan 05 00:00 UTC 2009
They have a more complete and linear main menu, as requested.
And they have a new menu while booting from the I/R
that presents different outcomes:

boot the I/R as usual;
load a previously installed kernel and initramfs and boot that ( to
avoid lilo errors );
continue booting but mount something different
than the initramfs for the real root filesystem ( to avoid lilo and
initramfs errors )

The third option is especially hand when a kernel and initramfs can
not be loaded
since booting from the I/R for rescue would become necessary.
This new menu is also a request.

Not every aspect of the Sorcerer menu driven installer was tested.
I tested installing it onto a single / partition
and installing it using a /boot and / partition.
I did not test the LVM, mdadm, luks or other aspects.
If you try them and they do not work
then please report the problem so that it can be fixed in the next release.

Also the previously released I/R from 2009 seems fine for use.
The menu driven installer on that CD has been more thoroughly tested.
It may be worth having if the 1st 2009 I/R does not do as expected.
The menu driven installer is still a very simple bash script.
Therefore, fixing bugs as they are encountered should not be difficult.

Thanks for all the input and feedback.
Good luck with your networks in 2009!
