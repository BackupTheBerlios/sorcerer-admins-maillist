</I>
When I was deciding how it aught to work I found it interesting that
certain choices had to be made that exclude some methods.
Having LVM2 on top of software RAIDs made sense at the time.
Use the software RAID to group up the disks.
Use the LVM2 to break it down.
However, LVM2 can also be used to group disks.
But it does not have the same benefits of the software RAID.
Are there reasons why this order is a mistake or less useful
than had it been the other way around?


&gt;<i> 3) encryption is the only thing that would work ;)
</I>&gt;<i> so I'll drop the idea of using lvm, it's sure interesting to be more

</I>
Using LUKS encrypted partitions on a notebook that can suspend to disk
seems counter intuitive, as I mentioned previously.
Something that might otherwise be encrypted could end up
written to the swap unencrypted during the suspend.
If someone managed to un-suspend from disk the notebook
then the encryption key for / or /home will be loaded back into
memory and those filesystems will be mounted
when the notebook resumes running
if those filesystems were mounted when the notebook was suspended.


Although I have not checked prices on large solid state drives,
probability for an extra $100 a notebook can have a USB
solid state drive to store almost everything required.
The fixed disk could be turned into an extra long term
storage area and spun up and down only when required.
Probably a memory drive will not be as fast as a fixed disk,
but the random access times should be excellent!
It could make loading programs such as firefox nearly instant.
firefox, for example, access many files while loading.
And while each file might not be fragmented,
they might not be close to each other on disk.

Maybe longer battery life can be achieved by not using the fixed disk drive?
I vaguely recollect seeing a notebook that advertised a battery charge
that would power and run the notebook for 7 hours.
Keep a notebook at 12.5% throttle, do not use the fixed disk drive,
reduce LCD back-light intensity and maybe it can run for a while?
Obviously, with 35W CPUs the notebook computer is not yet
approaching the efficiency of a solar calculator.  *lol*
Yes, I want a 16 gigaherts, 16 core, 256 bit, solar powered notebook.  :)
Maybe someday, yes?

I am open to suggestions for making Sorcerer
boot and shutdown run faster.
