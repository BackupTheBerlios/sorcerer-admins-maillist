eglibc is going to be glibc with a handful of lines changes.
If they are not breaking binary compatibility with glibc
then we can expect that if it quacks like a duck, walks like a duck,
and swims like a duck, then it's a duck!

I have a spell for installing glibc 2.9 from a repository.
It works just fine.
It requires updating since glibc should no longer install linux header files.
But other than that it worked fine before.


&gt;<i> Be that as it may, 668 of my 800 installed spells compiled OK with today's

</I>
# dispel libcap.
# rm /usr/include/sys/capability.h
# cast glibc

Be sure to use the LAG-0 grimoire
that became available about an hour ago.
And that will fix the libcap problem.

I have been sitting on the solution for about a week,
but been too busy playing with uClibc in order to update svn
I did not want to accidentally commit something to svn
that could be problematic.
As for libcap.
Apparently, it does not compile with current linux headers installed.
I do not know what is wrong with it.
I am assuming it is no longer required.
I know what linux capabilities are.
However Sorcerer's init was never modified in order
to implement linux capabilities so that root capabilities
can be dropped without switching the user away from root.
Basically it is a form of security which is unlikely anyone uses.
At least Sorcerer SAs probably do not use it.

I finally had a good compile with p7zip statically linked with uClibc.

It is a considerably smaller than previously.
Statically linked with glibc it was 1.8M
The only change I had to do to make it work
was switch the -O3 optimization to -Os.
Why it segmentation faults with -O3 I do not yet know.
I previously expected that bugs that appear as a result
of optimization selection were caused by gcc
and not the libc library that a program is linked with.
But is not as if -O3 is fatal in all instances.
I tried it with my hello.c program and it still worked fine.


&gt;<i> Soon I'll tell you if the system is more or less stable than it was... I has
</I>&gt;<i> a weird error when stuff linking to libc.so.6 would segfault.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tomorrow I'll run my movieeditor again, as this program can reliably trigger
</I>&gt;<i> that error.
</I>
Should be interesting.
With most other potential problems crossed off
I suspect that the previous stability problems were
caused by gcc's fix-includes.
It is so irritating.
Sometimes I want to switch from gcc to some other compiler.
Yet I have no clue what would be a good drop in replacement.
Some have tried and died and become history.

</I>&gt;<i> P.S. My kernels usually are the most up to date part of my boxen, just
</I>&gt;<i> because of the hardware that I run them on. So, no painfully funniness of
</I>&gt;<i> too old kernels... But, you just reminded me, I should really download a
</I>&gt;<i> 32bit I/R again.&#160; I miss the days of the really tiny I/R downloads.
</I>

It is conceivable that really tiny I/R may yet return.
I was emailing with the author of lzip
and newer versions of lzip seem to be excellent at compressing files,
perhaps even better than p7zip.
Although I must do some testing,
I might in the future release I/Rs where
all the archives for installed software are
lzip compressed instead of p7zip compressed.

Merely a matter of time and priorities has been
delaying my investigation of that.

Recently, the conversation on the list has been towards
&quot;build requirements&quot; which seems very much like an aspect
of the intention of creating or converting a deployment of Sorcerer
into a very tiny binary only deployment such as an embedded system.
Perhaps someone wants to be able to run a nearly complete Sorcerer
distribution off of a 2G SDD, for example.

Consequently, the integration of uClibc with Sorcerer could
provide the answers to several requests at once.
It could be used to make Sorcerer potentially better
for converting into an embedded deployment.
Also it may avoid future headaches involving glibc.
With as much as I still want to re-compile for the x86_64 I/R
and also the fixes related to libcap
I still have plenty of time to wait.
So I want to make some progress with uClibc first,
and then start testing and playing with lzip.
At first I was also waiting for the new stable release of lzip.
Fortunately, that has already happened.

It is interesting that you reported the expected change with Debian.
Since I have not been reading slashdot, I was unaware.
The near concurrent timing is interesting.
It seems like glibc has creates some itches
that senior level SAs want to scratch.
I know glibc has been itching me since even before glibc 2.9
But if nothing else it adds reason to believe
that transitioning to alternate libc is an issue worthy of exploration.
Obviously, going to eglibc aught to be easy
since it is basically glibc with an e in front of the name.  *lol*
Yet I have no idea what the stands for.  :)

While apparently there are some uClibc based distros,
the idea of transitioning from glibc to uClibc is bold.
If a complete transition is deemed worthy
then it might not be complete in 2009.
Frankly, we should not expect one way or the other.
We should only expect to test and see.
Best to start with some small stuff and see
how we like the changes.
Does it seem faster, better, smaller?
If so we can continue to add onto it until
the uClibc build environment becomes native instead
of being cross compiled.
