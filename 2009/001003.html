&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> New server machine is up and running - finally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some points from new I/R version, regarding its installer. Its a very

</I>&gt;<i> All current major distros works like a charm under KVM, Xen, 
</I>&gt;<i> VirtualBox, etc. I have tested several distros, Ubuntu, Debian, 
</I>&gt;<i> CentOS, Fedora. All Just Works, no major problems, but when i try 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer, i always get it to mess it up very seriously, installer does 
</I>&gt;<i> do wierd things, no bootloader, spell depencies are selecting so much 
</I>&gt;<i> packets so i need to scream loudly to my machine and kick it out of my 
</I>&gt;<i> window.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, i am using Virtualbox thru SSH X11 tunnel, and when i was 
</I>&gt;<i> installing current Sorcerer I/R its install - option in menu is very 
</I>&gt;<i> bad for virtualization environments. First it jammed my whole SSH 
</I>&gt;<i> session to Virtualbox, then i did fire it up using RDP connection and 
</I>&gt;<i> founded it did say Out of Memory errors, i was using 256MB RAM, so 
</I>&gt;<i> clearly thats not enough. Then i upgraded it to 512MB and it was 
</I>&gt;<i> enough, i did not bother to try eg. 384MB, etc... so i dont know what 
</I>&gt;<i> memory requirements are.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In compile option in installer menu, when i did go thru it, it asked 
</I>&gt;<i> spell selections, etc. i picked up cracklib, but its sources are not 
</I>&gt;<i> in I/R discs, so basicily whole system was not installing properly 
</I>&gt;<i> because nice &quot;Auto Failure&quot; feature, so eg. initramfs, init-functions 
</I>&gt;<i> etc, all refused to install because i picked cracklib... Including 
</I>&gt;<i> that lilo refused to not to make /etc/lilo.conf... arf.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay when i fixed all those horrible bugs i did manage to start 
</I>&gt;<i> sorcerer, but why are spell depencies always installing lots of stuff 
</I>&gt;<i> i dont need, meaning whole X Window/X.org and lots of X Window related 
</I>&gt;<i> spells, like media codecs, media players, etc.  I dont want some 
</I>&gt;<i> desktop crap installed, i want a very basic tools installed and no 
</I>&gt;<i> listening ports in default but currently i would guess its wanting to 
</I>&gt;<i> run some multimedia game pc and lots of ports listening for some 
</I>&gt;<i> services i dont know what they are (think some services heimdal 
</I>&gt;<i> wants?), so i think we need some options what we need to install and 
</I>&gt;<i> what not. Then some basic tools are missing in default, like ping 
</I>&gt;<i> command, thats wierd. I love Ubuntu way that there is zero listening 
</I>&gt;<i> daemons when you install it, you have to even install openssh-server 
</I>&gt;<i> to get SSH port open, but Sorcerer is a very different beast, it opens 
</I>&gt;<i> like 10 or more services that i dont even know what they are, its just 
</I>&gt;<i> so very wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, i almost forgot, network configuration, its just horrible, current 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;templates&quot; just suck. I would assume that almost all would need to 
</I>&gt;<i> use static ip or dhcp, but there are no instructions how to do it, and 
</I>&gt;<i> when you look general template, its not clear what to do, its very 
</I>&gt;<i> very confusing, clearly better templates are needed and installer 
</I>&gt;<i> should also have support to setup network settings (static, dhcp, 
</I>&gt;<i> etc). Currently i just love Debian style interfaces configuration, 
</I>&gt;<i> about billion time better system there than we have right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh yeah this is a rant but journey to get Sorcerer to run under 
</I>&gt;<i> virtualized environment is so full of pain to do and default depencies 
</I>&gt;<i> are so wrong. Clearly we need to polish installer to work better in 
</I>&gt;<i> different environments and to test it much much more to get all bugs 
</I>&gt;<i> out of it. Also, those spell depencies, i just dont get it why in 
</I>&gt;<i> default after installation i always to manage to get it to position to 
</I>&gt;<i> have install several GUI stuff, i think we need to get also solution 
</I>&gt;<i> to console only usage or at least some howto guide how to ban all 
</I>&gt;<i> graphics relates spells and howto reset system if whole X Window 
</I>&gt;<i> System / X.org wants to cast but your dont need it, or you need only 
</I>&gt;<i> basic X.org libraries, not several multimedia codecs, players, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kyle, how many servers is needed, we need to move 
</I>&gt;<i> sorcerer.silverice.org and ppr.silverice.org to this new server. If i 
</I>&gt;<i> install one server for sorcerer.silverice.org and for 
</I>&gt;<i> ppr.silverice.org? Then perhaps another server where we perhaps can 
</I>&gt;<i> set some automatic way to build new versions of spells, etc, perhaps 
</I>&gt;<i> third one for testing 64-bit sorcerer?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>whaow what a flame shoot ;)
I agree with some point like the fact that after install there shall be 
only terminal application installed
I didn't review the network templates for a while, but last time I 
checked it I was a little bit confused, since I can now read bash I 
looked further and then understood... but maybe a template per feature 
supported might be better.... let say instead of a &quot;generic&quot; into links 
then a dhcp, a static ethernet, a static wlan....
the network template seems to be readable and then I don't think it 
shall be &quot;improved&quot; right?

this is only a clue but if I look about others installers like ubuntu 
one, it simply duplicate the cd content onto the new root partition and 
update boot loader, so basically after install you have exactly the same 
OS than on the CD, I think this is better approach, I used this method 
to create the usb recovery disk (much more usefull from my point of view 
than a CD, it's small and don't scratch ;) )
so basically I think that a better way to install and simplier way is to 
duplicate the CD/usb content on the drive
like this you start from a totaly clean env, without preselected 
dependencies, btw is there any augur command that &quot;forget&quot; an optional 
requirement on all spell allready configured?
ie something that do

# augur forgetopt xinetd

forgetopt () {
    for spell in $(grep -l ${1} /etc/sorcery/log/opt.on); do
         sed -i &quot;s:${1}::g&quot; ${spell};
         echo &quot;${1}&quot; &gt;&gt; ${spell/opt.on/opt.off}
    done
}

best regards
