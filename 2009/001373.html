<PRE>I was assuming that the 4.3.1 version phonon is
the one included in the qt-x11-opensource.
Both use the same backend.
I still agree with the way that I set it up.
I do not agree because it worked.
When I booted a 2.6.31.6 linux kernel
I suddenly had a missing /dev/mixer and other sound problems.
But when I booted an older linux kernel 2.6.30.4
then both sound and networking worked fine.
Therefore, the problem seems to be linux related.

Although the 2.6.31.6 linux kernel seems to be configured correctly,
and I did double check the .config,
it seems to have issues or bugs involving sound
and at least the at76c50x_usb related networking,
although the problem might not be in that module.

Support for phonon is required for KDE.
KDE authors removed the latest phonon source tarball.
I presume that they will provide no new phonon.
Therefore, the newest phonon will be provided in qt-x11-opensource.
That is why I made the spell changes.

Obviously, the phonon 4.3.0 has problems since it
preferred using xine as the backend.
4.3.1 source tarball no longer effective exists for download.
So I do not want to force phonon back to version 4.3.0
and neglect using the newer phonon in qt-x11-opensource.
And yes, I tried it before discarding that solution.
Therefore, I still favor the solution of using phonon that
is installed by qt-x11-opensource because it should
eliminate phonon concerns with future updates of KDE
and qt-x11-opensource since phonon is now being provided
with qt-x11-opensource.
