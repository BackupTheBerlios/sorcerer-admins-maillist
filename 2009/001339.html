<PRE>I was unaware of the update.
That is why nothing broke for me.

Thanks for reporting the problem G&#225;sp&#225;r &#193;kos.

Updating xorg related spells is tricky.
The version numbers on the tarballs have
practically no meaning.
There has not been a full release of
an xorg version in a long time.
And because the last full release of xorg
contained some drivers that were somewhat faulty
it is unlikely that any distro provides only what
was part of the original X11R7.4 release.
So everyone has a mix of tarballs
with a mix of benefits and problems.

Jan Merka was probably trying to solve one problem
when he accidentally created a new problem.
Sometimes I accidentally create new problems
by updating to the most recently released
source tarballs that the software authors declared stable.
Often major updates of libraries like poppler are
best to hold back for while so that software authors
can adjust their sources to properly work with
the newer stable library versions.
Finding out what works is often try and see.

Since Jan Merka started this ball rolling and
knows what spells were modified
I am going to relax, do nothing, and wait
for him to retest and fix them.
If he can make a combination of newer xorg
related spells work better than the current lot
then that would be an improvement.


Everything below this line is old information
that is not directly related to the problem of
making the current combination of xorg spells work together.
However, it might be useful reading for those who have
a moment to spare.


For now spells/grimoire/sorcery support 4+ version progresses.
The primary 4 are:
stable
secure
unstable
latest
legacy

stable specifies the version recommended for use.

secure specifies the most recent version that was released
in order to fix a security problem.
The stable and secure version might be the same.
However, the secure version will usually be older,
and never newer than the stable version.

unstable specifies versions that the software author released
as developmental or unstable.
Sometimes I might add a version to unstable
if I tested it and discovered that it does not work.
That is a bad habit.
I really aught to add a version such as that to latest.

latest specifies versions of tarballs
that the software author released
that the software author considered stable.
However the version specified by latest
often create some problems if deployed.
So versions specified in latest
are something in between stable and unstable.

legacy specifies versions that were formerly stable
and in some cases beneficial to use at least
for a short while for SAs that would cringe at
the pain caused by an update to stable.

If an update of installed software using the
the stable version progress causes some bad breaks
and the spell has a legacy version available
then that is a subtle hint by someone that you
might want to try the legacy version.

Currently only the jpeg spell has a legacy version specified.
This is because there is a problem evident when using
gqview with the stable version of jpeg.
However, all other programs seem okay with
using the stable version of jpeg.
So it might be a bug in gqview.

When testing updates to the xorg related spells
using the latest version progress is probably best.
After one is certain that the new versions play nice
together then the changes can be made to the stable
version progress.
It is a bit more difficult to test this way.
But it allows some longer term testing
without causing pain for others,
because almost nobody will specify the
the latest version progress for their installed spells.
Using the &quot;latest version progress&quot; in this way
makes it sort of like a testing slot.
By using latest is implies that an understanding
that the version should be stable,
yet a hunch that something could go wrong
if it is deployed as stable.

I created the different version progress to
grant a bit of flexibility for SAs and grimoire gurus
without making it overly complex.

Some addition information is available by typing
# augur help progress

However, for the most part the version progress information
is not documented in official docs,
because we are using it with a &quot;try and see&quot; attitude.
It seems better than what we used to have.
But it was not over-planned and therefore
we might change anything and everything about it
if it becomes necessary and beneficial to do so.

For example the &quot;legacy version progress&quot;
was probably only added especially for the
jpeg spell because during the time that we
have had version progress only for two spells
did legacy version progress seem like it might be a god idea.

I apologize if my reply is a bit verbose
and seems like a bit of a digression to
the matter at hand.
I do not know if using different version progresses
would have been useful in this situation.
However, if it could be useful in future testing
then I prefer SAs and grimoire gurus to know about
the possibility of using version progress.

It is true that sometimes problems happen because
Sorcerer evolves spell by spell
instead of mega huge re-install everything from new CD leap.
However, the infrequent tiny headaches are often
small and easy to cope with
compared to the head-spliters we would have
if many things were messed up concurrently following
a full wipe and re-install from new CDs.

That is why Sorcerer has only one grimoire
instead of something like Debian's 3 different distribution
branches named after characters in the movie &quot;Toy Story.&quot;
Or at least that is what I thought they were doing previously.

Fortunately, the version progress provides a good
compromise for SAs and grimoire gurus.
Since Sorcerer is source based
we can cut the design of the distribution
as precisely as a single spell.
In contrast pre-compiled binary based distros
must keep huge masses of packages
in sync with the libraries they require
because pre-compiled binary based distros
can not detect problems and
do trivial healing following an update
like Sorcerer boxes do.

However, in order to maximize Sorcerer's advantage
we must make use of the version progress.
The way it is now is basically how it occurred to me.
I do not recall much discussion contributing to how it became.
Or maybe I forgot.
Basically I am eager to admit that it could become better.

However, if upon looking at what I wrote
you are thinking, &quot;Hmm that is not exactly intuitive
and it really aught to be this way instead...&quot;
Then please state your opinion and reasoning
on the list email so that it can be discussed
and therefore sorcery version progress can
evolve in a way that will encourage and help
SAs and grimoire gurus want to use it.

The current functionality of version progress
is stable and reliable.
Yes, it really works.
And we like that.
However, it is still &quot;try and see.&quot;
So there it is not definite that it will continue
forever especially if something thinks of something better.

Last year most of the discussion about version progress
had to do with how to integrate better support for
downloading from repositories instead of tarballs.
There were many good ideas.
I remember Jan Merka had an elaborate idea involving
storing repositories open somewhere in /var/cache/repo/
or in /var/cache/sources/
instead of converting repositories into tarballs.
But somehow we fell short of making any big changes
in sorcery to bring about better repository support.

There are a few spells in the grimoire that use repositories.
As expected they are held together with chewing gum
and scotch tape.
Sorcery has just enough modification to make it work.
And probably for the lack of having many spells that
use repository nobody has collected a huge amount of
data and experience that provides a clear indication
of how support for tarballs, svn, cvs, git, etc...
should all be integrated into an improved &quot;version progress system.&quot;
However, if one is considering about how it should be improved
then considering support for other methods of source
tree acquisition might also be a good idea.
Chances all that it will all have to play nice together
in the future if more software authors become
too lazy to roll tarballs.  :)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Are you absolutely certain about the version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; progresses that you have set and forced for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; software installed on that box?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; By executing:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; # augur progress
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; it will remind the SA about what version progress is set.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; However, if certain version progress was changed,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; but a newer and update was not completed after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; then unexpected previously selected versions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; might be installed instead of having it all congruent.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Most of the versions listed as the most current version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; in stable are tested once known to work and usually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; continue to work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; However, versions listed in the unstable progress
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; are not tested and probably will not work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Some might work if all the appropriate spells
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; are forced to unstable version progress.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; However, since xorg related spells often have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; different source trees that install headers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and different source trees that install libraries
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; it is usually a less than trivial task to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; unstable versions of xorg related spells.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; However, since this is Sorcerer the SA
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; does receive the final say about what is installed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; But if any of it are from non stable version progress
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; then I probably will not know what to expect or why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; something went wrong.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; So far my best guess is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the most obvious and easiest way to make it fail.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps a version progress is being forced?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Please double check.
