</I>
An executable can be linked with several libraries.
Some of those libraries can be ELF, some can be static.
The content of static libraries becomes part of the executable.
Therefore, if an executable is entirely static linked
then it ca not suffer an ELF failure.
An entirely static linked executable would also not depend upon
ld.so nor libc.so.6 in order to run.
Even if /lib/ or /lib64/ were missing the program would run if invoked.


&gt;<i> I would be willing to do a test on a fully loaded system in a few weeks when
</I>&gt;<i> I get back home to my testing station back home.
</I>
I am not planning any big changes.
I am just trying a few programs at a time.


&gt;<i> I am particularly interested in what the overall size increase will be.

</I>
Speaking of stability.
I suspect that the recent instability you noticed was from gcc
4.4.0 being installed without first breaking fix-includes.
gcc copying and modifying installed header files for other software
is a very unfortunate thing that causes terrible problems.


&gt;<i> It might even not be so bad to link with glibc. I would certainly like to
</I>&gt;<i> give it a go...
</I>
If Sorcerer transitions entirely to uClibc,
which I am only saying may be a possibility,
then glibc and libstdc++ ELF libraries
would still be provided in order to run some
software that is distributed in pre-compiled binary packages
that are not entirely statically linked.
However, one such program comes to mind that might be problematic.
I do not know if macromedia's firefox flash plugin that is
ELF linked with libc.so.6 and libstdc++.so.6 can be made
to work with a firefox linked with uClibc.
My guess is yes that it will work.
But still everything should be tried and discovered to work or not work,
rather than making any assumptions that become difficult to back out of.

&gt;<i> I don't particularly care for different languages to my own... besides,
</I>&gt;<i> since Sorcerer is compiled from source all the programs will have the
</I>&gt;<i> language preference of the SA in there already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am also curious about the Debian moving their distro over to eglibc (
</I>&gt;<i> mainly because those maintainers are actually willing to receive patches )
</I>
When I was searching for alternative glibcs
I did not discover eglibc.
Thanks for providing the information.
I will look it up.
Also I was unaware of Debian's transition to eglibc.
Has it just begun or is it already complete?
