<PRE>according to what I read :
1) suspend/resume can't be done using a lvm swap partition : since the 
swap partition shall be accessible directly from kernel boot (don't go 
through init process)
2) in sorcerer it's not possible to use software raid on top of lvm, 
since lvm shall be activated first before raid is activated, however I'm 
not sure that raid array can be dynimically updated like lvm allow
3) encryption is the only thing that would work ;)
so I'll drop the idea of using lvm, it's sure interesting to be more 
flexible and allow fast resizing of partitions, however I don't change  
my partition size every weekend and the actual size seems to fit me...
I'll then simply activate my suspend (there are boons with suspend, 
especially on laptops when you run out of battery and don't wanna loose 
all your open applications...) and toy around with ext4....

</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, applying LUKS encryption to a

</I>&gt;<i> swap does not start until runlevels.
</I>&gt;<i> It is often activated first when the runlevel begins.
</I>&gt;<i> runlevels begin after sysinit finishes.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, having swap on a software RAID, LVM, or encrypted
</I>&gt;<i> should be possible if it is supported.
</I>&gt;<i> If I remember correctly LVM is simply a front end,
</I>&gt;<i> a complicated one at that, to the device mapper.
</I>&gt;<i> And the device mapper is used to partition disks,
</I>&gt;<i> but not in the traditional method of partitioning.
</I>&gt;<i> Having an LUKS encrypted swap works.
</I>&gt;<i> It is support in linux.
</I>&gt;<i> The designated luks swap partition is initialized with
</I>&gt;<i> a random key on each boot.
</I>&gt;<i> Since LUKS can work ontop of LVM this combination should be possible.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I do not recall testing if swap can be made directly
</I>&gt;<i> on a LVM logical volume.
</I>&gt;<i> Logically, I would expect it to be so.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> But it does require testing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The order of software raids, LVM2, and LUKS on Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> is probably different than any other distro.
</I>&gt;<i> I selected this order so that if an encrypted filesystem
</I>&gt;<i> were to span two or more physical volumes
</I>&gt;<i> then each volume would not require a separate password prompt
</I>&gt;<i> and/or separate password.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it has not been extensively tested.
</I>&gt;<i> I usually use either regular partitions, LUKS encrypted partitions,
</I>&gt;<i> or LVM2, but not a combination of the above .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, if it is indeed set up correctly
</I>&gt;<i> then Sorcerer should support any of the sophisticated
</I>&gt;<i> partitioning, volume management, and encryption that
</I>&gt;<i> is available on most any distribution.
</I>&gt;<i> However, evms is not supported!
</I>&gt;<i> Also, different encryption methods other than LUKS
</I>&gt;<i> are not supported by the menu driven installer.
</I>&gt;<i> However, you can use them if desired, such as using
</I>&gt;<i> the cryptloop device to create a looped back encrypted
</I>&gt;<i> filesystem out of a file, partition, or logical device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As with most things about POSIX systems,
</I>&gt;<i> there is usually more than one way to do it,
</I>&gt;<i> and not just one &quot;correct&quot; way.
</I>&gt;<i> Also there is no good substitution for just playing
</I>&gt;<i> with it to gain a feel for how it works.
</I>&gt;<i> Even reading the manual pages for LVM2 is rather confusing.
</I>&gt;<i> What's a logical group, logical volume, physical volume?
</I>&gt;<i> I barely remember.
</I>&gt;<i> But once one sets up a LVM2 style deployment a few times
</I>&gt;<i> then it becomes almost intuitive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Encrypted root filesystem in conjunction with a CMOS password,
</I>&gt;<i> and decent lilo password is a good combination for a notebook.
</I>&gt;<i> For a secret or higher level notebook and/or workstation
</I>&gt;<i> then I also recommend using an encrypted swap.
</I>&gt;<i> Given sufficient RAM, 3G 4G, most Sorcerer boxes will do
</I>&gt;<i> almost no swapping.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet still disk caching and buffering can be improved on those boxes,
</I>&gt;<i> by having some swap space so that RAM that remains nearly unused
</I>&gt;<i> while a box is running can be swapped to disk and thus become available
</I>&gt;<i> for other more important uses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a dual core or quad core box
</I>&gt;<i> the impact of an encrypted root filesystem is nearly negligible
</I>&gt;<i> since there is almost always spare CPU available for handling the encryption.
</I>&gt;<i> That is nice to know.
</I>&gt;<i> Also it is nearly impossible to buy a new notebook computer
</I>&gt;<i> that is not a SMP core.
</I>&gt;<i> That is also why the x86_64 linux-modular configuration only
</I>&gt;<i> has the SMP configuration and not a separate non SMP configuration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer is a decent operating system to use in an environment where
</I>&gt;<i> one's bytes must remain safe.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it does not have completed support for selinux.
</I>&gt;<i> However, not many SAs would be able to configure and deploy
</I>&gt;<i> a selinux enabled box properly to maximize the security benefits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jan might know the answers to the suspend/resume questions.
</I>&gt;<i> I know nothing bout suspend/resume,
</I>&gt;<i> except that a suspend/resume swap partition
</I>&gt;<i> must not be an encrypted partition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Shutting down a Sorcerer box properly and restarting it,
</I>&gt;<i> is not such a dangerous nor long process provided that
</I>&gt;<i> the /boot partition did not run out of space while generating initramfs images.
</I>&gt;<i> A full suspend to disk is not a necessity on a notebook,
</I>&gt;<i> especially where security is paramount!
</I>&gt;<i> A suspend to disk would write the entire contents of RAM
</I>&gt;<i> unencrypted to the suspend/swap partition.
</I>&gt;<i> This is counter-intuitive to having encrypted filesystems!
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, I recommend either:
</I>&gt;<i> a non encrypted deployment that can suspend to disk;
</I>&gt;<i> or an encrypted deployment that can not suspend to disk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, remember that if a notebook goes out of one's possession
</I>&gt;<i> that someone could tamper with the initramfs and linux kernel
</I>&gt;<i> that reside on the unencrypted boot partition.
</I>&gt;<i> There is one way to prevent that!
</I>&gt;<i> Keep a separate USB drive key for booting that is only plugged
</I>&gt;<i> into the notebook when the notebook is booted.
</I>&gt;<i> Soon as the notebook is booted,
</I>&gt;<i> and assuming no updates linux are required,
</I>&gt;<i> umount /boot and remove the USB key.
</I>&gt;<i> This way the entire contents of the notebook disk drives can be encrypted,
</I>&gt;<i> while the only unencrypted bytes are store on the USB key which is kept
</I>&gt;<i> normally separated from the notebook.
</I>&gt;<i> This way if the notebook, but not USB key,
</I>&gt;<i> go out of possession and then return
</I>&gt;<i> the data on the notebook will have not been compromised
</I>&gt;<i> nor adjusted so that the notebook can be rooted on the next boot.
</I>&gt;<i> Fun huh?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes users that share a notebook can have separate personal USB keys.
</I>&gt;<i> But they would all have to know the LUKS password for the / partition
</I>&gt;<i> unless each has separate encrypted partitions that they can use.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I seriously doubt with the low expense of notebook computers
</I>&gt;<i> that a company would share the deployment of notebooks among users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If one uses a separate USB key for booting a notebook,
</I>&gt;<i> please make a dd backup of that key onto another key.
</I>&gt;<i> We all know how having just one key tends tends to invite
</I>&gt;<i> the problem of a key being lost or damaged.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, with the Sorcerer method for LUKS encryption,
</I>&gt;<i> LUKS encrypted filesystems receive their password from
</I>&gt;<i> a prompt made to the SA during boot.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, the actual password key is not stored on disk in a file.
</I>&gt;<i> Memorize the password and swallow the paper.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> Just joking about eating the paper.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is good to know that the merely having
</I>&gt;<i> an encrypted notebook and USB key to boot it is not
</I>&gt;<i> enough to boot the box and gain access to the encrypted / filesystem.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if anyone gains possession to the unencrypted USB key,
</I>&gt;<i> that can be compromised so that on a future boot the notebook
</I>&gt;<i> could be rooted while running.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Someone might know about notebooks that have fixed disk encryption
</I>&gt;<i> where a password is promoted for during the BIOS portion of boot.
</I>&gt;<i> Those notebooks might be more secure than can be achieved using
</I>&gt;<i> LUKS software encryption provided with Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I do not know what notebooks come with
</I>&gt;<i> hardware encryption for the fixed disks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I saw a cute tiny notebook with a solid state drive at the other day.
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like a little toy.
</I>&gt;<i> Has only meager 16G drive.
</I>&gt;<i> But it is a step in the direction towards disk less portables.
</I>&gt;<i> It would be usable by someone with eagle eyed vision and
</I>&gt;<i> would not mind attaching a USB external drive,
</I>&gt;<i> or as an email / websurfing box?
