Why does that to me seem that it would make something

</I>&gt;<i> will be installed 365 day a year....
</I>
Good idea, but understated.
If atimes were enabled on Sorcerer boxes, which normally they are not,
then the filesystem would reveal that over 90% of the installed files
are not accessed over a long period of time.
Here is a fun fact:

# du -sm /boot/{2.6.29.1,fast}
83      /boot/2.6.29.1
13      /boot/fast

Both directories have the same kernel image.
However, the initramfs image is different.
The one in /boot/fast consists of only the files
that are used on the initrf the last time a boot occurred
using the full initrf provided in /boot/2.6.29.1/
That is why /boot/fast is a meager 15% the size of /boot/2.6.29.1

Although Sorcerer boxes could be made to delete files
that are not used that solution might not be best.
For example, manual pages might not normally be used.
But when one wants to read one, it is good to have them installed.  :)

Too bad atimes are bad for a fixed disk lifespan,
otherwise they might have potential usefulness.

&gt;<i> 300M?!? you're kiding! linux is made for developpers! and what do
</I>&gt;<i> developpers like? development tools of course! look at perl, python,

</I>&gt;<i> used a year? to be frank on my 9G / partition I use 7G and I'm almost
</I>&gt;<i> certain that I can discard 4G of them without even carring...
</I>
At first Python, perl, ruby, java, etc... seem unessential.
However, sometimes tools such as those are used for
even trival tasks such as reading manual pages.
Perl might still be required for reading manual pages.
Who know what Python might be used for?
Before Debian boxes switched to dash all their init-scripts were perl.
Programmers use these scripting, editing, and macro languages
for convenience and now we are stuck with having to install them.
Years ago there was a time when I supplied a Sorcerer I/R disk
that did not have perl installed.
Now it even has such perl, tcl, tk, probably even Python installed.
Without a very careful selection of installed software
discarding the heavy requirements is difficult.


&gt;<i> my box use xfce, fluxbox, and few other binaries that will weight at
</I>&gt;<i> most 100M, ok there are dependencies... a typical xubuntu cdrom is
</I>&gt;<i> 650M _EVERYTHING_BUILD_ ie with lot of tools, the runtime env is only

</I>&gt;<i> this means that on my 7G partition, I only require 650M to run the

</I>&gt;<i> know the asle of LinuxFromScratch when you use such distro (it always
</I>&gt;<i> miss some header... or library archive... or yadayada)
</I>
I do not know what LinuxFromScratch as evolved into,
but originally it was a tiny document that described how
to install some very old versions of about 30 software projects.
According to some reports from other SAs who tried LFS,
putting together a box that way requires months of effort and work.
And then it would only boot.
In contrast Sorcerer only requires a few hours which are mostly
non interactive compilation time.
Hardly a headache.
But probably less informative than doing it without a distro.
I would be curios to know if anyone with a LFS box
can keep installed software up to date like a Sorcerer box.


&gt;&gt;<i> by being able to dispel build only requirements
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they would soon come to regret the decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for blowing big holes that must be repaired

</I>

&gt;<i> or rm -rf /var/cache and try to cast without network.....

</I>

&gt;<i> sorcery won't ever prevent me to do that...
</I>
Should it?


&gt;<i> the changes required on sorcery and spell is really low compared to
</I>&gt;<i> the possibilities
</I>&gt;<i> you always complain about taking time to recompile x86_64 software on

</I>&gt;<i> host, and runtime requirements that will be provided by the target fs
</I>&gt;<i> and that won't run on the host (can be for example arm binaries...)
</I>
I do not have to speculate about cross-compiling.
I have done enough cross-compiling to know exactly
why I would rather wait for qemu to do it instead of
cross-compiling software.
And yes I do probably still have archived cross-compile
tool chains for x86_64 architecture.


&gt;&gt;<i> I hate to seem so uncompromising about it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, having separate concepts of build and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> runtime requirements is something borrowed from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pre-compiled binary based distros.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WRONG, it is a concept that is mandatory when creating a rescue disk,
</I>&gt;<i> as well as when crosscompiling.... as explained before...
</I>&gt;<i> same it could even be used to provide chrooted installs....
</I>&gt;<i> imagine that you could install without having to use a 3rd party lib
</I>&gt;<i> to track changes on filesystem, and that this install is performed
</I>&gt;<i> into a chrooted env? how can you perform that? hummm what if in build
</I>&gt;<i> requirements I have install and gcc.... what do I need to perform
</I>&gt;<i> install step? well in fact only what is in build requirement, simply
</I>&gt;<i> copy them to some dir, do chroot to this dir and perform the install.
</I>&gt;<i> after that clean the dir by removing all file copied and you have a
</I>&gt;<i> perfect safe install... it works even on systems that don't support
</I>&gt;<i> DESTDIR....
</I>
It is actually easier than that.
Simply create a union fileystem using fuse
Make the all the files in the / filesystem appear within the chroot
filesystem without them actually being there.
That way there is no copying involved.
Yet why do I not do that?
Because dispel has to executed outside of the chroot.
Some sources will not install properly until
the previously installed files are removed.

Currently, sorcery dispels previously installed software
just before the newly compiled software is installed.
This is a great boon/convenience that we take for granted.
It minimizes the amount of time and probability that a program
will be executed and fail execution.

For example, we can run firefox while updating firefox.
But if firefox is not running and we start to run it while
firefox is installing
then firefox would be unavailable.
However, since firefox is not dispelled before it compiles,
it is available to start, right up until the point at which
the new firefox begins installing.
It is not 100% availability, but it is better than having
to bring a box to runlevel 1, kick off all the users,
and create an hour or two of downtime while installed
software is updated.

As far as I recall no SA has complained about software
being unavailable and not starting during updates.
There is a probability for problems to happen.
But in actuality they rarely happen.

The current system using sentinel's pre-load library
requires less overhead and CPU cycles than a fuse overlay
or union filesystem and it also is far more reliable and disk friendly
than doing a cp of all files that may be required in order to compile
a source tree.
There are far more files required to compile a source than
most SAs would expect.
Identifying and copying all those files into a chroot would
be a chore of epic proportions.
No one would want for that to happen each time a source is compiled.
And it would require separate chroots for concurrently compiling sources.
It would require a tremendous amount of disk space.

Obviously, if a cut down embedded
installation of Sorcerer suitable only for runtime is desired
then the easiest way is still to start with a proper and full Sorcerer
installation,
copy it, and then delete the files that would not be required such as
/usr/lib/*.a and /usr/include/

If someone runs that cut down box for a time with atimes enabled
then it would probably be possible to eliminate another 90% of files
that are not used during normal operations.
Yet if a user or application requested it to do something unusual
that had not been done before
then it would probably break for trying to access a file
that is not present, but should be.


&gt;<i> same for crosscompiling, some host binaries has to be present during
</I>&gt;<i> the install step, however to prevent having a missbehaving spell
</I>&gt;<i> overwrite the host binaries with target binaries, the install shall be
</I>&gt;<i> performed in a chroot jail with only a minimal copy of mandatory BUILD
</I>&gt;<i> tools....
</I>&gt;<i> sorcerer is a source based distro, this means that it shall permit all
</I>&gt;<i> what is allowed by such distro : COMPILE, and even crosscompile...
</I>
cross-compilation is not normally performed chrooted.
Merely the target of installation is changed so that
the installed files do not go into / nor /usr


&gt;<i> even with this actual design of sorcerer won't warants that some
</I>&gt;<i> missbehaving source will not modify some files outside it's source
</I>&gt;<i> tree during compilation time, and since tracking can't be activated
</I>&gt;<i> all time because of slowness, if some spell do modification before
</I>&gt;<i> prepare_install it won't be tracked... hopefully by activating md5sums
</I>&gt;<i> you can be on the safe side... most of the time... imaging that glibc
</I>&gt;<i> has a bug during install and create an empty /lib/libc.so? ahaha I
</I>&gt;<i> wonder how will your box will behave....
</I>
glibc can not be installed ontop of a running glibc.
That is why the library cache is present so that installed libraries
can be moved out of their normal installed positions, yet be made
available for use while newer libraries are installed.

As for chrooting...
Any program running with the root account can break free of a chroot,
if it was programmed to do so.
That is why services that run inside a chroot also switch
the user and group away from root after it is started.


Interesting ideas.
I would like to summarize.
Yes, a Sorcerer box can be chopped down into what is absolutely necessary.
But do not expect to be able to easily repair and update it that way.
Cut it back if desired,
but do not fail to maintain also a complete master installation for updating.
This concept is the same concept that is used when
creating the /boot/fast/initrf

/boot/fast/initrf is a cut down initramfs image.
Although it can be used during boot
I do not attempt to replace the initramfs image
in /boot/2.6.29.1/initrf with the /boot/fast/initrf
Why?
Because if there is a problem with/ boot/fast/initrf
then /boot/2.6.29.1/initrf is the one that should be booted,
because it is far easier to trouble-shoot.
Simply changing the installed motherboard could
render /boot/fast/initrf unusable, for example.
But /boot/2.6.29.1/initrf would still work if the SA selects it.
Consequently, it shows that the convenience and speed
of a cut down filesystem can be enjoyed.
But the proper filesystem must still be available somewhere
in the event that the cut down filesystem becomes inadequate.

Because it is possible to cut down a filesystem upwards of 90%
the concept of having build-only requirements is but a drop
in the bucket compared to what could be achieved if the SA
knows exactly what files can be removed and does so.
Asking for build-only requirements is like asking for grapes,
when really you want grapefruit.
And the way to enjoy the bigger fruit is to know how to
cut a filesystem.
However, do not epxect to be able to repair a cut down filesystem.
It is not impossible, but it is complicated.
Therefore, still maintain a proper Sorcerer installation somewhere.
