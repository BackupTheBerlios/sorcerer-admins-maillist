<PRE>There are 3 things we should remember.

More memory consumed = more page faulting = slower programs.
Something that I discovered with the sdelta series of programs
was that it was faster to repeatedly calculate as required a block size
using a subtraction of offsets rather than to store block sizes
using additional memory.
An x86_64 operating system uses by default
64 bit integers instead of 32 bit integers.
64 bit are twice as large and therefore use twice as much memory.
The x86_64 instruction set is also a bit larger.
Consequently, x86_64 will use more memory.
Using more memory = slower execution.

Almost all programs used today are written for 32 bit architecture,
and some would still work on 16 bit architecture.
Programs designed for 32 bit architecture run no faster for
being compiled on 64 bit architecture.
Some programs do use 64 bit integers explicitly,
such as the programs that I write.
However, the compiler can still handle 64 bit integer math using
32 bit registers by using additional instructions.

While 64 bit architecture does allow addressing nearly 64G of memory,
few programs address more than 1G of memory,
mostly by design, but a few respect the limitations of
being run on 32 bit operating systems.

So will running a 64 bit operating system grant better program performance?
Probably not.
It uses a bit more memory and a bit more disk space than IA32.
However, there are some instances where a 64 bit operating system
would be good for the task:
a dedicated high a capacity database server;
a top level domain name server.

When there is a great deal of data that is needed
and must be accessed quickly,
and have as much stored in RAM as possible
then those roles are better suited to 64 bit architecture
than 32 bit architecture,
and a box fully loaded with RAM.

So with that said, no Sorcerer SA need be sad
about running Sorcerer IA32 on their x86_64 boxes
instead of Sorcerer x86_64.
With delayed bus writes and half sized integers
performance of an IA32 operating system on an x86_64 box
aught to be excellent.
