<PRE>Hi agree with evert,
since I don't install often sorcerer (to be franck the last time I did 
was due to a total mess of the FS after an upgrade, and to be franck 
it's so long that I don't remember when hahaha) I rarely contribute on 
feedback about the installer. But if we want to have a good installer we 
shall do it often
&quot;I do not agree with having the option to select any spell for which you 
do not have sources until Sorcerer is installed and network aware.&quot; I 
also agrees about that
for my point of view I thinks that an I/R shall have everything to run a 
console and to connect to some network, it shall be a standalone 
sorcerer, simply it boots from CD instead of harddrive
after some testing with usb drive I noticed that one of the fastest way 
to create a bootable device is simply to copy from an existing sorcerer 
(either cdrom or harddrive) and to configure lilo and fstab to use 
/dev/disk/by-uuid/* entries instead of legacy /dev/sd* or /dev/hd* or 
anything else.... this is really the fastest way and the most secure 
one, it can be performed without having to boot on the I/R (ie from an 
existing sorcerer, from any linux, even from windows, and I even created 
it using a virtual machine under windows (don't shoot the messenger ;) 
)), and this has several advantages

so from my point of view, what an I/R media be is : a network aware 
minimalistic (console only) sorcerer box that can copy itself to another 
media through a menu

an additional interesting point : I don't aggree with evert about the 
skillcheck when trying anything different with the install : if a 
modular kernel (ie a kernel that has every module compiled) wasn't 
provided it would be hopeless to even boot the rescue cd from an usb 
drive or a virtualised host.... what I see is that the issues are not to 
boot the I/R and to run it in any env, the issues arrise AFTER the 
install! for some reason, after the install, the state of the box isn't 
the same than while booting the I/R
you can have everything running on the I/R and can't even boot on the 
new install....

best regards

</I>&gt;<i> I agree that the Sorcerer I/R should be as small as possible. In my

</I>&gt;<i> you can cast anything you want. This approach has the added benefit of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Hi
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     New server machine is up and running - finally.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Some points from new I/R version, regarding its installer. Its a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     very hostile toward any virtualization environment...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     All current major distros works like a charm under KVM, Xen,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     VirtualBox, etc. I have tested several distros, Ubuntu, Debian,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     CentOS, Fedora. All Just Works, no major problems, but when i try
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Sorcerer, i always get it to mess it up very seriously, installer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     does do wierd things, no bootloader, spell depencies are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     selecting so much packets so i need to scream loudly to my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     machine and kick it out of my window.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     For example, i am using Virtualbox thru SSH X11 tunnel, and when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     i was installing current Sorcerer I/R its install - option in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     menu is very bad for virtualization environments. First it jammed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     my whole SSH session to Virtualbox, then i did fire it up using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     RDP connection and founded it did say Out of Memory errors, i was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     using 256MB RAM, so clearly thats not enough. Then i upgraded it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to 512MB and it was enough, i did not bother to try eg. 384MB,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     etc... so i dont know what memory requirements are.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     In compile option in installer menu, when i did go thru it, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     asked spell selections, etc. i picked up cracklib, but its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     sources are not in I/R discs, so basicily whole system was not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     installing properly because nice &quot;Auto Failure&quot; feature, so eg.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     initramfs, init-functions etc, all refused to install because i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     picked cracklib... Including that lilo refused to not to make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     /etc/lilo.conf... arf.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Okay when i fixed all those horrible bugs i did manage to start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     sorcerer, but why are spell depencies always installing lots of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     stuff i dont need, meaning whole X Window/X.org and lots of X
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Window related spells, like media codecs, media players, etc.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     dont want some desktop crap installed, i want a very basic tools
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     installed and no listening ports in default but currently i would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     guess its wanting to run some multimedia game pc and lots of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ports listening for some services i dont know what they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (think some services heimdal wants?), so i think we need some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     options what we need to install and what not. Then some basic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     tools are missing in default, like ping command, thats wierd. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     love Ubuntu way that there is zero listening daemons when you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     install it, you have to even install openssh-server to get SSH
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     port open, but Sorcerer is a very different beast, it opens like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     10 or more services that i dont even know what they are, its just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     so very wrong.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Oh, i almost forgot, network configuration, its just horrible,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     current &quot;templates&quot; just suck. I would assume that almost all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     would need to use static ip or dhcp, but there are no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     instructions how to do it, and when you look general template,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     its not clear what to do, its very very confusing, clearly better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     templates are needed and installer should also have support to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     setup network settings (static, dhcp, etc). Currently i just love
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Debian style interfaces configuration, about billion time better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     system there than we have right now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Oh yeah this is a rant but journey to get Sorcerer to run under
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     virtualized environment is so full of pain to do and default
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     depencies are so wrong. Clearly we need to polish installer to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     work better in different environments and to test it much much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     more to get all bugs out of it. Also, those spell depencies, i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     just dont get it why in default after installation i always to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     manage to get it to position to have install several GUI stuff, i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     think we need to get also solution to console only usage or at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     least some howto guide how to ban all graphics relates spells and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     howto reset system if whole X Window System / X.org wants to cast
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     but your dont need it, or you need only basic X.org libraries,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     not several multimedia codecs, players, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Kyle, how many servers is needed, we need to move
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     sorcerer.silverice.org &lt;<A HREF="http://sorcerer.silverice.org">http://sorcerer.silverice.org</A>&gt; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ppr.silverice.org &lt;<A HREF="http://ppr.silverice.org">http://ppr.silverice.org</A>&gt; to this new server.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     If i install one server for sorcerer.silverice.org
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &lt;<A HREF="http://sorcerer.silverice.org">http://sorcerer.silverice.org</A>&gt; and for ppr.silverice.org
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &lt;<A HREF="http://ppr.silverice.org">http://ppr.silverice.org</A>&gt;? Then perhaps another server where we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     perhaps can set some automatic way to build new versions of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     spells, etc, perhaps third one for testing 64-bit sorcerer?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>     whaow what a flame shoot ;)
</I>&gt;<i>     I agree with some point like the fact that after install there
</I>&gt;<i>     shall be only terminal application installed
</I>&gt;<i>     I didn't review the network templates for a while, but last time I
</I>&gt;<i>     checked it I was a little bit confused, since I can now read bash
</I>&gt;<i>     I looked further and then understood... but maybe a template per
</I>&gt;<i>     feature supported might be better.... let say instead of a
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;generic&quot; into links then a dhcp, a static ethernet, a static wlan....
</I>&gt;<i>     the network template seems to be readable and then I don't think
</I>&gt;<i>     it shall be &quot;improved&quot; right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     this is only a clue but if I look about others installers like
</I>&gt;<i>     ubuntu one, it simply duplicate the cd content onto the new root
</I>&gt;<i>     partition and update boot loader, so basically after install you
</I>&gt;<i>     have exactly the same OS than on the CD, I think this is better
</I>&gt;<i>     approach, I used this method to create the usb recovery disk (much
</I>&gt;<i>     more usefull from my point of view than a CD, it's small and don't
</I>&gt;<i>     scratch ;) )
</I>&gt;<i>     so basically I think that a better way to install and simplier way
</I>&gt;<i>     is to duplicate the CD/usb content on the drive
</I>&gt;<i>     like this you start from a totaly clean env, without preselected
</I>&gt;<i>     dependencies, btw is there any augur command that &quot;forget&quot; an
</I>&gt;<i>     optional requirement on all spell allready configured?
</I>&gt;<i>     ie something that do
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     # augur forgetopt xinetd
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     forgetopt () {
</I>&gt;<i>         for spell in $(grep -l ${1} /etc/sorcery/log/opt.on); do
</I>&gt;<i>              sed -i &quot;s:${1}::g&quot; ${spell};
</I>&gt;<i>              echo &quot;${1}&quot; &gt;&gt; ${spell/opt.on/opt.off}
</I>&gt;<i>         done
</I>&gt;<i>     }
