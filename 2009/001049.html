<PRE>The network templates are better in the grimoire tarball
than on the last I/R
But they are still a long way from becoming excellent.

&gt;<i> There was some other package that didn't recognize it should inclue
</I>&gt;<i> -lwrap... but I forgot what that was...
</I>
What do you want to use TCP wrappers for when
you have iptables and a linux box?


&gt;<i> Botan didn't recognize my processor, and I had to hand-add --cpu=amd64 to spell
</I>
Do you use Botan for anything?
It is not actually required by any spell in the grimoire.


&gt;<i> It would be nice if the functions in /etc/networks.d/functions would
</I>&gt;<i> support setting like ETHADDR to specify the ethernet address of a
</I>&gt;<i> card... not a big deal, until I update next and functinos are
</I>&gt;<i> overwritten.
</I>
I am reasonably certain that the networking templates
allow to specify multiple IP address for a network device,
both multiple IPv4 and IPv6 address if desired.


&gt;<i> (My cable company has the hw addr of my card registered, and this new
</I>&gt;<i> box, being the new gateway, needed to emulate the old address - well,
</I>&gt;<i> guess I could call them and say that I had to replace it and
</I>&gt;<i> re-register the new IP *shrug* )
</I>
They know the MAC address of the previous card?
It might be possible to change the MAC address of a card
or fake a different one, perhaps?

&gt;<i> oh - and dhclient, for some reason, doesn't seem to work, so I had to
</I>&gt;<i> re-order the detect of dhcpcd and dhclient in functions... I don't
</I>&gt;<i> know why it doesn't work, but it just sits there.
</I>
I vaguely recall Jan pointing out that dhclient must be started
during runlevels instead of during sysinit.
I forgot exactly why.
Or maybe that was some other program.


&gt;<i> Other than that this has gone very smoothly. &#160;I now have a amd x64 box
</I>&gt;<i> as my gateway with quite a bit of extra space (if you need a build
</I>&gt;<i> site)
</I>
I am always at a lack of x86_64 CPU power.
I am currently awaiting the outcome of an linux-modular
compile on qemu-system-x86_64
