<PRE>I am still working on improving the networking templates.
Nobody offered help with that so I have been testing
and bug fixing it one line at a time.
The networking templates in the currently grimoire are
better than those that were available on the last initramfs.
By better I only mean that they have less bugs.
The ones on the 2009 I/R break in some places.

As for handling the services associated with providing the Sorcerer I/R,
and patches, I leave that to you Pekka.Panula.
Having a real x86_64 installation is for nothing but
testing would be a boon to increasing the quality of the
the x86_64 port of Sorcerer.
However, it must be properly firewalled, because
there is no telling what it might run when rebooted.
Also it will probably break and not reboot from time to time
and require a SA with local access to be able to fix it.
I broke the booting of my IA32 test box several times
usually when updating udev stuff.

Having a virtual x86_64 Sorcerer machine with near full speed emulation
would be useful if it can be started and controlled using something
like qemu and a VNC client so that it can be repaired
even remotely by me if it fails to reboot when rebooted.


Now to return to the previous topic.
I expect that I have understood the basics of the feedback,
and yes it was feedback and not flames.

1. Prevent selecting of uninstalled optionals
when running cast while booted from the I/R.

2. Networking templates suck.

3. inetutils should be added to the list of software
that is unarchived onto the initramfs/rootfs

That much I can improve.


Speaking of fun stuff...

I see this often in the kernel buffer.

uhci_hcd 0000:00:1f.2: host controller process error, something bad happened!
uhci_hcd 0000:00:1f.2: host controller halted, very bad!
uhci_hcd 0000:00:1f.2: HC died; cleaning up

Seems as if the new USB NIC I bought for my IA32 test box
not only disconnects itself from the network from time to time,
but also causes the controller driver to die.
Fortunately, I can
# rmmod uhci_usb
# modprobe uhci-usb
# /etc/init.d/networks restart
And I can do the check and execute the commands periodically by a script.
But still it is annoying.
Standard networking templates do not handle something like this.
Anyone else have weird networking issues the want to tell me about?
It might deserve some further consideration?

</I>&gt;<i> Some points from new I/R version, regarding its installer. Its a very

</I>&gt;<i> All current major distros works like a charm under KVM, Xen, VirtualBox,

</I>&gt;<i> depencies are selecting so much packets so i need to scream loudly to my
</I>&gt;<i> machine and kick it out of my window.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, i am using Virtualbox thru SSH X11 tunnel, and when i was
</I>&gt;<i> installing current Sorcerer I/R its install - option in menu is very bad for
</I>&gt;<i> virtualization environments. First it jammed my whole SSH session to
</I>&gt;<i> Virtualbox, then i did fire it up using RDP connection and founded it did
</I>&gt;<i> say Out of Memory errors, i was using 256MB RAM, so clearly thats not
</I>&gt;<i> enough. Then i upgraded it to 512MB and it was enough, i did not bother to
</I>&gt;<i> try eg. 384MB, etc... so i dont know what memory requirements are.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In compile option in installer menu, when i did go thru it, it asked spell
</I>&gt;<i> selections, etc. i picked up cracklib, but its sources are not in I/R discs,
</I>&gt;<i> so basicily whole system was not installing properly because nice &quot;Auto
</I>&gt;<i> Failure&quot; feature, so eg. initramfs, init-functions etc, all refused to
</I>&gt;<i> install because i picked cracklib... Including that lilo refused to not to
</I>&gt;<i> make /etc/lilo.conf... arf.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay when i fixed all those horrible bugs i did manage to start sorcerer,
</I>&gt;<i> but why are spell depencies always installing lots of stuff i dont need,
</I>&gt;<i> meaning whole X Window/X.org and lots of X Window related spells, like media
</I>&gt;<i> codecs, media players, etc.  I dont want some desktop crap installed, i want
</I>&gt;<i> a very basic tools installed and no listening ports in default but currently
</I>&gt;<i> i would guess its wanting to run some multimedia game pc and lots of ports
</I>&gt;<i> listening for some services i dont know what they are (think some services
</I>&gt;<i> heimdal wants?), so i think we need some options what we need to install and
</I>&gt;<i> what not. Then some basic tools are missing in default, like ping command,
</I>&gt;<i> thats wierd. I love Ubuntu way that there is zero listening daemons when you
</I>&gt;<i> install it, you have to even install openssh-server to get SSH port open,
</I>&gt;<i> but Sorcerer is a very different beast, it opens like 10 or more services
</I>&gt;<i> that i dont even know what they are, its just so very wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, i almost forgot, network configuration, its just horrible, current
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;templates&quot; just suck. I would assume that almost all would need to use
</I>&gt;<i> static ip or dhcp, but there are no instructions how to do it, and when you
</I>&gt;<i> look general template, its not clear what to do, its very very confusing,
</I>&gt;<i> clearly better templates are needed and installer should also have support
</I>&gt;<i> to setup network settings (static, dhcp, etc). Currently i just love Debian
</I>&gt;<i> style interfaces configuration, about billion time better system there than
</I>&gt;<i> we have right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh yeah this is a rant but journey to get Sorcerer to run under virtualized
</I>&gt;<i> environment is so full of pain to do and default depencies are so wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly we need to polish installer to work better in different environments
</I>&gt;<i> and to test it much much more to get all bugs out of it. Also, those spell
</I>&gt;<i> depencies, i just dont get it why in default after installation i always to
</I>&gt;<i> manage to get it to position to have install several GUI stuff, i think we
</I>&gt;<i> need to get also solution to console only usage or at least some howto guide
</I>&gt;<i> how to ban all graphics relates spells and howto reset system if whole X
</I>&gt;<i> Window System / X.org wants to cast but your dont need it, or you need only
</I>&gt;<i> basic X.org libraries, not several multimedia codecs, players, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kyle, how many servers is needed, we need to move sorcerer.silverice.org and
</I>&gt;<i> ppr.silverice.org to this new server. If i install one server for
</I>&gt;<i> sorcerer.silverice.org and for ppr.silverice.org? Then perhaps another
</I>&gt;<i> server where we perhaps can set some automatic way to build new versions of
</I>&gt;<i> spells, etc, perhaps third one for testing 64-bit sorcerer?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Terveisin/Regards,
