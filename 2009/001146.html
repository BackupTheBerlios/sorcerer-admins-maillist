<PRE>Le Tue, 12 May 2009 10:20:44 -0700,
Kyle Sallee &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sorcerer-admins">kyle.sallee at gmail.com</A>&gt; a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> Ok.
</I>&gt;<i> That is news to me.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for reporting it.
</I>&gt;<i> Since I do not have jdk installed on any 64 bit architectures
</I>&gt;<i> I was unaware that it was missing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems unclear why a whole 64 bit jdk would be provided,
</I>&gt;<i> yet be without the 64 bit plugin.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps there are other java implementations we should consider?
</I>&gt;<i> Could perhaps gcc's java be used as a plugin?
</I>&gt;<i> Nobody is probably eager to try and compile jdk from source,
</I>&gt;<i> but it could be attempted if one has a few weeks to try it.
</I>
is there a good tutorial about? lol

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, I am in the process of creating an i586-linux-uclibc
</I>&gt;<i> port of Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course jdk will not run on it.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, we could use some alternatives.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the moment I have a long way to go before the port is complete.
</I>&gt;<i> I am doing much manual compilation merely because sentinel is
</I>&gt;<i> unusable as a preload in a mixed target environment.
</I>
that's also what I was complaining about in a previous mail... great
spirits always gather ;)
I was looking into unionfs-fuse code some time ago and it would'nt be
that difficult to have it modified so that it can filter the content of
the filesystem... imagine you create an unionfs with compile tools as
RO part and tmpfs as RW part and set a filter so that the only files
seable from RO part are the ones provided by the augur arof...
then compile it into a chroot jail on top of the unionfs... and you 
likely have one of the best way to compile a software... more 
relyable than sentinel, suitable for crosscompilation or even
test compilation... allowing to double check the compile requirements...
well loooooot of boons....
in fact it require another thing beside filtering : providing native
tools into a separate tree like /opt/ but this can be achieved by a
mount --bind easely
the filtered unionfs would have been there only for replacing sentinel

&gt;<i> &lt;....&gt;
</I>well if I could complete the ARCH feature of sorcery instead of speaking
long time about a minor change into spell format (merly just adding 
build_requirement function as an alias to requirement into main sorcery
when ARCH isn't set...) it wouldn't have been pain in the ass to test
uclibc....
ARCH feature was meant for crosscompiling... however the mechanism
bellow is much more versatile... it was meant to allow compiling into a
safe chroot jail... allowing to make any test as if you were into an
emulated env but without the trouble of emulated env... anyway a dream 
remain a dream sometime

best regards
JLM
