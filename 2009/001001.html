<PRE>Hi

New server machine is up and running - finally. 

Some points from new I/R version, regarding its installer. Its a very 
hostile toward any virtualization environment... 
All current major distros works like a charm under KVM, Xen, VirtualBox, 
etc. I have tested several distros, Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora. All 
Just Works, no major problems, but when i try Sorcerer, i always get it to 
mess it up very seriously, installer does do wierd things, no bootloader, 
spell depencies are selecting so much packets so i need to scream loudly 
to my machine and kick it out of my window. 

For example, i am using Virtualbox thru SSH X11 tunnel, and when i was 
installing current Sorcerer I/R its install - option in menu is very bad 
for virtualization environments. First it jammed my whole SSH session to 
Virtualbox, then i did fire it up using RDP connection and founded it did 
say Out of Memory errors, i was using 256MB RAM, so clearly thats not 
enough. Then i upgraded it to 512MB and it was enough, i did not bother to 
try eg. 384MB, etc... so i dont know what memory requirements are.

In compile option in installer menu, when i did go thru it, it asked spell 
selections, etc. i picked up cracklib, but its sources are not in I/R 
discs, so basicily whole system was not installing properly because nice 
&quot;Auto Failure&quot; feature, so eg. initramfs, init-functions etc, all refused 
to install because i picked cracklib... Including that lilo refused to not 
to make /etc/lilo.conf... arf. 

Okay when i fixed all those horrible bugs i did manage to start sorcerer, 
but why are spell depencies always installing lots of stuff i dont need, 
meaning whole X Window/X.org and lots of X Window related spells, like 
media codecs, media players, etc.  I dont want some desktop crap 
installed, i want a very basic tools installed and no listening ports in 
default but currently i would guess its wanting to run some multimedia 
game pc and lots of ports listening for some services i dont know what 
they are (think some services heimdal wants?), so i think we need some 
options what we need to install and what not. Then some basic tools are 
missing in default, like ping command, thats wierd. I love Ubuntu way that 
there is zero listening daemons when you install it, you have to even 
install openssh-server to get SSH port open, but Sorcerer is a very 
different beast, it opens like 10 or more services that i dont even know 
what they are, its just so very wrong. 

Oh, i almost forgot, network configuration, its just horrible, current 
&quot;templates&quot; just suck. I would assume that almost all would need to use 
static ip or dhcp, but there are no instructions how to do it, and when 
you look general template, its not clear what to do, its very very 
confusing, clearly better templates are needed and installer should also 
have support to setup network settings (static, dhcp, etc). Currently i 
just love Debian style interfaces configuration, about billion time better 
system there than we have right now. 

Oh yeah this is a rant but journey to get Sorcerer to run under 
virtualized environment is so full of pain to do and default depencies are 
so wrong. Clearly we need to polish installer to work better in different 
environments and to test it much much more to get all bugs out of it. 
Also, those spell depencies, i just dont get it why in default after 
installation i always to manage to get it to position to have install 
several GUI stuff, i think we need to get also solution to console only 
usage or at least some howto guide how to ban all graphics relates spells 
and howto reset system if whole X Window System / X.org wants to cast but 
your dont need it, or you need only basic X.org libraries, not several 
multimedia codecs, players, etc. 

Kyle, how many servers is needed, we need to move sorcerer.silverice.org 
and ppr.silverice.org to this new server. If i install one server for 
sorcerer.silverice.org and for ppr.silverice.org? Then perhaps another 
server where we perhaps can set some automatic way to build new versions 
of spells, etc, perhaps third one for testing 64-bit sorcerer?

Terveisin/Regards,
   Pekka Panula, Net Servant Oy
