The new 2.6.30 configs are in the grimoire.
Usually transitions are not problematic.
However, there are exceptions.
The kernel configuration involving NFS was problematic in the past.

Recently, there are some new kernel features
involving filesystem and file caching.
I have not read the docs on it, yet.
So I compiled it as loadable modules.
My test box is booted with 2.6.30 now,
but my workstation is still 2.6.29.2
However, 2.6.30 is installed.
I have just been busy testing other stuff.


&gt;<i> kqemu spell is marked as broken... but this is what qemu says it uses
</I>&gt;<i> to run in non-emulation mode (virtualized, so instructions run n the
</I>&gt;<i> bare metal)
</I>
I am uncertain where to acquire the source
for kqemu that is compatible with linux 2.6.30
Any ideas about that?
I do not know who is maintaining a kqemu module.

Seems as if those who are more interested in virtual machine emulation
are going the route of buying the new motherboards and microproessors
that support the additional instructions that are used by kvm.

If kvm is loaded on a CPU that does not support it,
the syslog will have something like:

kernel: has_svn: can't execute cpuid_8000000a
kernel: kvm: no hardware support

I tried it anyway.  :)

Ah, there is a new experimental versioning filesystem in the linux kernel.
When I saw the configure options come up for it
I could not help but wonder if Jan would want to play with that.
*chuckle*

Hope everyone's week had a great start.
