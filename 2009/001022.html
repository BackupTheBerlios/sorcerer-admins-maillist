<PRE>The backup/preserve rule for files in /etc
did not have anything to do with backing up the filesystem.
Those are different issues entirely.

The changes I announced most recently were to indicate to SAs
that I made changes so that SA can easily keep both modified
files in /etc while having easy access to the originals in /etc.ori/

It saves SAs the trouble of having to copy before modifying,
yet still having the original to revert to at anytime for any reason.
Basically, this change is merely implementing a convenience that
SAs would do otherwise on an as needed basis.


As for restoring boxes to a previous state
there are snapshot logs that a SA can use
to discover exactly what software at what versions
were installed on a given date.
/var/log/sorcery/snap.gz

There are a number of ways to use it.

# zcat snap.gz | LC_ALL=C grep &quot;^200902210903&quot; | cut -f2-

That would show all the software and versions installed at that time.

# zcat snap.gz | LC_ALL=C grep &quot;grimoire&quot;

That would show the times of snapshots when the grimoire was installed
and the installed version of the grimoire.
It will show many lines because the grimoire is always installed.
If one wanted to know what versions of the grimoire had been installed...

# zcat snap.gz | LC_ALL=C grep &quot;grimoire&quot; | cut -f2- | uniq

snapshot logs can be used in any way the SA wants.
The information in a snapshot log can be used to
recreate the installed software the way
that it would have been at a certain time in the past.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The following will be the current rules regarding most files in /etc/

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When a spell is dispelled,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This way after the the updated spell finishes installing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modified /etc/ files can be transferred back into /etc/
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Convenient, yes?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The original /etc/ files for spells are now installed in both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /etc/ and also /etc.ori/
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This way diffing a modified and original /etc/ file

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, /etc.ori/ is a bit non standard.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And so is /etc.sav/
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, these aught to give SAs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> greater convenience than the choice between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a preserve and backup rules.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And most boxes have plenty of space to nearly replicate /etc/
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The files in /etc.ori/ are merely for SA convenience.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They have no checksums.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Consequently, removing them should not create problems.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Although not /etc/ files,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all files installed in /usr/doc/ /usr/share/doc/ /usr/share/locale/LC_MESSAGES/
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can also be removed anytime.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No CPU cycles or disk wear and tear is wasted on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> checking the content of files that are often unessential.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Did someone ask how to reconfigure all the installed spells on a Sorcerer box.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> # rm /etc/sorcery/log/config/*/sorcery /etc/sorcery/log/opt.{on,off}/*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> # cast --deps $( augur installed )
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, I have not tried it.
