</I>
I hope you did not do that as root
or were careful to specify that the extracted files
should go into the current directory and not into /

The initramfs contains 2 cpio archives
that are concatenated together.
Chances are that the command you used
only extracted the first of the two cpio archives.
The kernel would have extracted both.
37M seems about right for the kernel module initramfs.

</I>
For SA convenience Sorcerer does not use a cut down sysinit
with separate utilities only used during sysinit such as uClibc and busybox.
Instead Sorcerer uses a sysinit built from the utilities
that we understand and want to use and would normally use.
Consequently, the Sorcerer initramfs
is as large as the directories I mentioned before.
Why not go for the minimized initramfs?
A better question is why?
Who runs a Sorcerer box that has less than 384M of RAM?
Do we not build boxes with +1G of RAM?
We can afford fluffy complete initramfs images.
We are not using 66Mhz 386DX with 16M of RAM and 512M of disk space.
That is ancient history.
So why use a tiny initramfs?

Besides, cutting back the initramfs size also
requires some reduction in the nearly 40M of kernel modules
that are provided on the initramfs.
There is no way some other distro provides a tiny initramfs
and a full compliment of kernel modules
with it being at least as large as required for the kernel modules.
But when I tried that before some Sorcerer SAs did not
want the exclusion of any kernel modules from the initramfs.

Consequently, the current initramfs is not much of a compromise.
It is big and fluffy.
The only compromise is that I provide separate initramfs for each linux kernel.
That minimizes the amount of RAM required to load the initramfs
during boot by excluding from each initramfs a full compliment
of kernel modules for each /boot/*/linux kernel

However, making just one initramfs for all /boot/*/linux
would conserve more disk space,
but require more RAM during boot,
and require longer to load.

The minimum size for an initramfs is 0
A kernel with required filesystem and disk device drivers compiled in
can boot the fixed disk and mount the real root filesystem
instead of having to use an initramfs.
We all know that from experience since it was the preferred
Sorcerer method for booting for many years.

The next smallest initramfs size is
1M + the size of the desired kernel modules
sysinit can be run by a busybox that is statically linked with uClibc.
The potential usefulness of this is amazing!
However it is still more limited a Sorcerer initramfs.

I know how to create busybox powered initramfs images.
However, the compliment of kernel modules is
60x to 100x larger than busybox and required init-scripts.
Therefore, if there is no compromise made about what
kernel modules are made available on the initramfs
then using busybox seems silly.
The difference between a 40M initramfs and a 80M initramfs
is not that big in my mind when I have at least 512M of RAM to load it.
Consequently, the art of making a tiny initramfs
involves deciding what should be cut and sacrificed.

# ls -lah /boot/fast
total 14M
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K 2009-05-26 13:23 .
drwxr-xr-x 7 root root 4.0K 2009-05-26 13:24 ..
-rw------- 1 root root  12M 2009-05-26 13:23 initrf
-rw-r--r-- 2 root root 1.6M 2009-05-09 05:25 linux
-rw-r--r-- 2 root root 770K 2009-05-09 05:25 System.map

Here is a gnu utility and glibc based initramfs precisely
trimmed to the required files and modules
that are required for booting my file server.
12M
Impressive considering that it does not use busybox/uClibc.
What is the catch?
It is only suitable for booting the computer it was made on,
assuming that computer has no hardware changes.
It is also nearly useless for debugging.
Even /bin/ls would be probably be missing from that initramfs
since /bin/ls is not normally run during sysinit.
Do you mind doing directory listings with
# echo *
?

With an initramfs image like that,
which is easy to generate by rebooting a box,
one can extract the content of the cpio images
to see exactly what modules are stored in the initramfs
and how much of the initramfs space the modules require.

At the moment I am not interested in that.
However, to someone interested in making very tiny initramfs
images then it should provide some clues about what module
directories from a linux kernel should be included as a whole
on the initramfs.

I am under the impression that for modules that were not
possible to load during sysinit,
due to being excluded from the initramfs,
that another invocation of a udev cold plug trigger event
can cause those modules to be loaded during runlevel
when the true root filesystem is mounted.
Therefore, we could make progress at whittling down
the intiramfs load of modules if Sorcerer SAs form
some consensus about what modules should be
excluded from initramfs generation.
Otherwise we can leave the intiramfs generation
as it is currently since it works and is not broke.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hmm, does seem larger on my test box also.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, it is not yet +100M big.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The initrd is composed of select files and directories
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> archived into a cpio from the directories
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /etc /bin /sbin /lib /lib64
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Static archive libraries are not included in the archive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nothing from /etc/sorcery/ is included.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Many files in /etc/ are not included.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, if you did something like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> # cp -av /etc/sorcery /etc/sorcery.old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then that would cause a large amount of files
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be included in the cpio archive that are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not essential for booting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Instead of trying to determine exactly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what directories from /etc are worth
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> including in the initramfs I tried to discover
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what directories in /etc/ could be installed by a spell
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet would not be required during sysinit.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I saved a considerable amount of space
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the initramfs by excluding only that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, a SA could still create directories
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in /etc/ that consume space on the initramfs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet are otherwise useless during booting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No doubt that a method for creating a more precise initramfs is possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, I expect it would also require almost constant revision.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If something new is introduced that installs into /bin /sbin /lib or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /lib64
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and would be required during sysinit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then the initramfs script would require adjustment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or at least some component sourced in by the initramfs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would need to be changed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you want a better/more precise initramfs script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then spell complexity must be increased in order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to specify precisely what should be inclined
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on an intiramfs if such directories as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /bin /sbin /lib /lib64 and /etc are not included nearly as a whole.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, from /lib in each initramfs only the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /lib/modules/$VERSION/ from the appropriate kernel version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is included in that initramfs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Consequently, only modules to load
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that are appropriate for the running kernel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are included on the initramfs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Originally, my design was to create merely one initramfs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usable by all kernels installed in /boot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A single initramfs is faster to generate.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, booting is a bit slower to load
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such a large initramfs, and of course more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory is required in order to store the entire
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> content of /lib/modules in the initramfs instead
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of only modules required by the kernel being booted.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I mentioned that old method that I obsoleted to demonstrate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that there are potentially other ways of building the initramfs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also the initramfs can be compressed in order to conserve maybe 30%.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, the initramfs is only compressed by default
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when it is provided on the Install/Rescue CD.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So the fun options for making the initramfs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> require less disk space are: compression or redesign.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have accepted that initramfs will become larger in time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Eventually a 256M initramfs will not be absurd.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even a modern kernel and boot loader can handle it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Therefore, I am not overly worried about a 100M initramfs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, I am not closed to discussion about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what should be done to improve initramfs generation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also I should mention that in the past I attempted to selectively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exclude kernel modules and module directories that I expected
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be unessential during sysinit.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, SAs complained.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Consequently, each initrmafs has a complete set of modules
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is appropriate for the kernel being boot.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yet it does consume considerable space.
