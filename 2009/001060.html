Although I appreciate new spells as much as any SA,
I write on average a few hundred each year.
Therefore, I prefer if someone else embraces the burden
of checking contributed spells to make certain that they are
of sufficient quality.

While testing new perl--* spells I often discover that
the requirement lists for those spells
are missing all the spells that they should require.
Instead they only list perl as a requirement.
Sure the software installs,
but I would not expect it to run properly with missing requirements.

Therefore, please do your best to make certain that the requirement
lists for contribute spells are correct and not recursive,
because once a spell enters the grimoire there is no telling how
long it may be before I check it.
Usually, it will go unchecked until a newer version of it becomes available.

I do not intend to seem ungrateful for new spell contributions,
however tending 3500+ spells is already a big task.
That is why I prefer new spells to enter the grimoire already
in a flawless state.
It requires of me longer to check and fix an incomplete spell
than it does for those spell authors to make the spell.
I end up looking at the source tree, reading INSTALL README,
visiting the software homepage, reading there,
running augur check many times, etc...
It becomes a lot of extra work for me to fix a spell
which in most cases provides software which I will
never use and maybe only one other SA might use.
That is why I prefer the person who writes the spell to do their best,
and then the person who checks the spell to do their best.
That way when I update the spell it will require little effort by me.
Otherwise, if the person who writes the spell does so sloppily
then 95% of the effort of fixing that spell becomes my problem.
And if the grimoire is 95% full of 95% broken spells
then the distribution will 95% not work.
So if we want it to work we must all do are parts properly.

I probably seem not appreciative,
however I estimate that the having the current grimoire usable
to be of more importance than having a lot of new spells that
are busted and neglected.
The grimoire is already full of many neglected spells that
could benefit from better init-scripts, better spells, etc...

Only in the last month or two did I fix httpd spell
so that it properly requires apr-util, for example.
and that fixed problems with httpd and subversion.
I just now noticed I forgot to add apr-util as a requirement
to subversion and now corrected it.
It just goes doubly to show much effort is still required to
maintain and improve existing spells,
enough that I am still making mistakes.

That is why I tend to personally not want
to handle the checking and integration of contributed spells.
I already have 3500+ spells that that
require attention and fixing.  :)

However, I like new contributed spells when they work properly.
Sometimes I even throw one into the grimoire just for fun
that I wrote myself.
smoking guns, which is the spell called &quot;sg&quot;
is an amusing game and just for fun.
However, the spell is proper and installs the software properly
and the software is usable.
I added that spell in 2009, just for fun.
Enjoy.
