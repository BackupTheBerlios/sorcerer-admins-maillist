I have already fixed some of the tiny errors and requeued spells to cast.
281 spells to cast on an i586 pentium mmx will require some time.
However, it seems to be on course.
Also it seems a bit faster already compiling in the native uClibc architecture.

Since uClibc does not support selinux
there will be no selinux entanglement with this port.
It should not be too difficult to pull apart and strip down
for those that want a thinner more precise installation.

Seems unlikely that NVIDIA and ATI pre-compiled binary drivers will be
usable on the uClibc port.
Also I might not include a spell for installing glibc compatible libraries.
The reason for that is because any installed ELF that requires glibc libraries
probably requires other ELF libraries that also link with glibc libraries.
The thought of setting up a &quot;to glibc&quot; cross-compile tool chain is unappealing
when a chrooted Sorcerer installation based upon glibc can be grafted
onto the host filesystem in the same fashion that an IA32 port can be grafted
onto an x86_64 filesystem.

For pure servers and workstations the uClibc port is small and fast!
However, I have not yet decided how I want to implement locales data
base support.
Currently, uClibc is provided with wide character support and thus is
locales enabled,
however it has no locales databases compiled into the uClibc's libc.
Why?
Mainly because support for all UTF-8 locales requires an additional 300K.
That 300K is probably added directly into the size of static linked executables.
So, for the moment no locales support until with the uClibc port
until I have more time to play and experiment with it.

Once implemented, selecting locales database
will require uClibc re-compilation and re-installation,
unlike glibc where the locales databases exist outside of the libraries.
However, since most SAs will only want to support a few locales
the size increase will not be the full 300K.

Currently, uClibc does not support shift locales and probably not
some if not all of the non UTF-8 locales.
