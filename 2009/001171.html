<PRE>Somewhat less than 3G of address space
can be allocated on IA32 architecture.
And somewhere under 64G of address space
can be allocated on x86_64 architecture.
Those are the limits.
Allocation of address space has it's uses
even if that memory is not used or not used immediately.
Allocating a large address space is very useful for compression programs.
Many programs do it.
And while it does cost a little bit of additional RAM as overhead,
it is not a necessarily bad thing.
Each program has mostly it's own private address space.
Just because one process has allocated 2G of address space
does not mean that a different process can not allocate 2G of address space.
The linux kernel is rather generous in allowing overcommit,
which means more address space can be allocated than
there is both RAM + swap to back it.
However, sometimes linux will fail large allocations of address space.
I have had it do that to my programs when I was somewhat
overtasking my workstation.

Sometimes I consider that the availability of a system swap space
are was poor design for POSIX.
When allocating large amounts of address space
with intention to use that address space
then performance is usually better when
the backing for the address space is mmaped
to a temporary file instead of being backed by
the system swap.

As long as disk space is available on /tmp
and /tmp is not a tmpfs
then only the architecture limitations
effect the limit for the amount of address space
that an be allocated and used.

When looking at process in top
I do not know the way, if possible,
to determine if the address space requested
is backed by system swap or a private tmp file.
Yet that might be something a SA would want to know.
If a box has only a 512M swap area
then that might be sufficient even for programs
using 2.5G of RAM if that program backs the
address space with a private temporary file.

The way sdelta3 works is that it backs the memory
address space allocated using a private temporary file.
For a short while, while berlios was not putting me
under the a quota the size of the eye of a needle
I managed to be able to generate some sdelta3 patch
files on their box, which had almost no swap area,
by using a private temporary file for backing.

Anyway, my insight into backing address space
with swap or tmpfiles is probably beyond the
usefulness and interest of most SAs,
so I will leave it at that.
