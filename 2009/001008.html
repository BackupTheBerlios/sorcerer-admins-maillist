<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Thanks for the bug reports.
I wish I had the hardware to test it.
I test installations of Sorcerer ia32 and x86_64
using qemu and qemu-system-x86_64 both with -m 384.
The memory requirement is not steep.

I have not attempted to ssh into the box,
but instead connect to qemu using a VNC client.

Yes there are many daemons started that continue
to run when booting a box.
Most can be safely killed.

/etc/init.d/rpcbind stop
/etc/init.d/multipathd stop
/etc/init.d/acpid stop
/etc/init.d/bgz stop
/etc/init.d/dbus stop
/etc/init.d/cups stop
/etc/init.d/immune stop
/etc/init.d/rpc.idmapd stop
/etc/init.d/xinetd stop
/etc/init.d/msyslog stop
/etc/inti.d/sshd stop
/etc/init.d/hald stop

However, if sshd is stopped
then the box will not listen for inbound ssh connections
even if a network interface is raised.

bgz, the background compression program,
will stop itself after a few minutes.
bgz and immune are parts of Sorcerer that I wrote.
The rest of the services are standard to most boxes.
They are for syslog, printing, NFS, SSH
Most of the services started by xinetd are provided by heimdal.
They provide kerberos secured services.
They can be disabled by editing the files in /etc/xinet.d/*
and then setting disable = yes and then restarting xinetd.
However, if no xinetd launched services are required
then chmod 600 /etc/init.d/xinetd will keep it from running.

The services running are not secure in the fact that each
freshly installed Sorcerer box has an empty root password.
Security minded SAs should set the root password ASAP.

Libraries provided by xorg come pre-installed.
If not wanted
then they can be uninstalled using dispel.
Unless the SA starts selecting optionals as on
during execution of cast
then much of the software provided on a new box
will be optional and easily removed.

Since a newly installed box will not have DNS and Internet,
selecting options as on that are not already [*] installed
will cause spells to fail to compile when their optional
requirements can not be downloaded and installed.
Installing software requires an Internet connection.
Sorcerer boxes come with only a tiny selection of
source tarballs in /var/cache/sources/

The latest Install/Rescue disks are from 2009.
They have enough experimental kernel options enabled
that they should be able to run virtualized.

The base installation of Sorcerer comes with a lot of fun software,
including libraries and executables for playing audio and video files.
For almost all graphics hardware starting an X session is also possible.
The reason for the additional software is to ease SAs'
the hassle and concern of installing the software required to run X.
No guess work is required since everything except proprietary drivers
from NVIDIA and ATI are included.
The speed difference for having xorg already installed saves
about 2 hours of compilation while costing about 5 extra
minutes for installation.
The additional software can be removed using
sorcery's dispel menu for about 2 minutes of effort.

Completely removing xorg is possible.
It is not easy.
Some installed software may break.
It should not cause any critical breaks.
Installation of xorg is nearly standard among
both workstations and dedicated servers.

Since <A HREF="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</A> is downloadable
I will give it a try.
However, qemu version 0.9.0 might work better.
I have not tried booting a vmware virtualized Sorcerer box.
Probably all of the software on the Sorcerer x86_64 I/R
was compiled within qemu-system-x86_64
Almost all of it has -march=native
If that caused a problem please let me know
and a different -march can be used.

# augur from /usr/bin/ping
inetutils:/usr/bin/ping
inetutils:/usr/bin/ping6

ping is available.
So are almost all of the other expected tools.
However, when the Install/Rescue CD boots
from CD it has only the tools expected of an initramfs.
Therefore, /lib /lib64 /sbin /bin are available.
Little else is available.
However, after installation to a fixed disk or flash drives is complete,
and it finishes booting from that
then all of /usr/bin and /usr/sbin and /usr/lib and /usr/lib64 is available.

The reason why the content of the entire 300+ megabyte CD
is not loaded into the initramfs is obvious.
It is not required when installing the Sorcerer box.
However, the tools can be added to the initramfs by:
# cd /
# 7za x -so /media/cdrom/var/cache/archive/inetutils-*.tar.7z | tar -xf -

If the box has the RAM and
then the entire contents of /var/cache/archive can be
uncompressed onto the initramfs rootfs.
Currently, bfr, coreutils, file, kexec-tools, msyslog, openssh,
openssl, parted, pciutils, usbutils, util-linux
are unpacked from archive onto the initramfs.
I will also include inetutils in the next release.
Every little bit added to the initramfs rootfs will increase
the amount of RAM required for installation.
I do not know what the base requirement is since I test using 384M
384M is the current recommended minimum requirement for deploying Sorcerer.
The IA32 test box has merely 384M of RAM.

openssh works great to and from Sorcerer boxes.
dialog works excellent over openssh assuming
that the terminal on the client side can support ncurses.
If the terminal is less than adequate
then I am not certain what the results would be.
I do not know if dialog controls
the terminal using common ANSI control sequences or not.
I do most of my sshing from either a linux console
or from KDE 4's konsole program.
Both work great.

I continually try to improve the Sorcerer Install/Rescue disks.
In the past dialog was not an unreasonable requirement
for providing an easy to navigate interface for SAs.
Even sorcery, the menu driven tool, from the sorcery tools
uses dialog for interacting with the SA.
If the use of dialog should be discontinued
then this requires a great deal of code to be rewritten
and also something of an adequate substitute for dialog
to be provided.
Any recommendations?

As for the other reported issues,
please be as specific as possible.
Exactly what should be fixed is not entirely clear.
Removing all the software from the I/R that is
xorg and xine related would be a regression to
a style that would require SAs more time to
complete the installation of most boxes.
Also, just as it is easy enough to derail an installation,
by selecting optional software such as cracklib,
which is not provided on the I/R
If none of xorg is provided then
it will increase the amount of opportunities
for the SA to select software which can not be installed.

cracklib and cracklib-words will now have tarballs provided on the I/R
However, SAs are still encouraged to not select optionals as on
during the installation sequence.

Apparently, I must modify cast
so that optionals can be be selected during Sorcerer installation.
However, it is a performance hit that will exist
for each time cast is invoked.
It was not something that I wanted to do.
But at least that much will prevent SAs from running into trouble
until after their first reboot to fixed disk or flash drive.

You may want to invoke sorcery
and visit the dispel menu,
because it can very amusingly be used
to tear the guts right out of a Sorcerer installation.
Both lone software, installed software without requirements upon it,
and also software that is installed but only optionally required
can be selected for removal using dispel.
It could be used to dispel 100+ spells
including all of the xine and xorg stuff.
It provides a progression from menu to menu where
software can be selected for removal.
As software is selected for removal,
installed software may enter into the categories of optional and lone.
When it does that software becomes available for consideration for
removal on the next dialog presented by dispel.

It repeats this process until there is no software left to consider.
It is like first removing a coat, then a sweater, then a shirt, then a T-shirt.
Removing a T-shirt while still wearing one's coat makes no sense, correct?
In that respect software presented for the possibility of removal
is only presented when it makes sense to do so.
Removing ncurses, for example, never makes sense,
because /bin/bash requires it and
a box would break bad if ncurses were permanently removed.
Consequently, nonsensical removal decisions are not presented to the SA.

Thanks to SA feedback, sorcery's dispel menu provides a very eloquent
method for selecting software for removal.
It is both powerful, yet pleasing since it will not usually give a SA
enough choices to completely wreck their box.

However, for lack of understanding sorcery's select menu,
SAs have wrecked their boxes by uninstalling essential software.
The select menu is not a good idea for Sorcerer SA novices.

Since Sorcerer evolved from a distribution that was originally
intended only to scratch the itch that senior level SAs acquire
from using pre-compiled binary based distros,
the Sorcerer distro has a plenty of ways for a SA to wreck
their box if the SA has a novice moment.
However, much of the functionality added in 2008 was
to bring Sorcerer closer to the type of distro that can be
used by merely experienced SAs
without the skills expected of a senior level SA.
However, Sorcerer still has a long way to go before
it could become as novice friendly as many of
the pre-compiled binary based distros are.
Still, as it currently is, it is not a bad compromise between
giving SAs absolute control over every aspect of their deployed box,
and having the convenience of such things
as an entirely modular linux kernel.
Sorcerer has both good power and good convenience.

In the past some discussion was made about the decision
to make scripts in /etc/init.d/ non modifiable.
They would be considered executables and not configuration files.
Currently, the only thing that is supported is changing the mode
on files in /etc/init.d/
The changes that the SA makes to the mode of the file will
continue to be maintained as installed software updates.
Non executable init-scripts will not run automatically during boot and shutdown.

But what if the SA wants to use a customized init script?
Is there a problem?
Is it impossible?
No it is easy.
Just copy the existing init-script to a new name.
Modify it.
Add the # Provides: the_original_name
Make the new init-script executable.
Make the old init-script non-executable.
Then, try to remember the change and make certain
that the SAs custom init-script is commensurate with
the original init-script each time the box is updated.
The last part is the pain.
The other parts are easy.

I am not trying to make Sorcerer difficult for SAs.
I am trying to provide a Sorcerer as a distribution
that will continue booting and is upgradeable.
Sorcerer init-scripts have changed frequently and
dramatically in the past.
They have changed both content, name, and what they accomplish.
There is no one /etc/init.d/mount script that does everything
that was expected of /etc/init.d/mount in 2004.
Instead almost every divisionable aspect of booting has
been provided in separate init-scripts that are easily checked,
read and do exactly what is expected.
This is why each Sorcerer box has over 100
init-scripts just from the initial installation.
It would be a mess to create all the symbolic links
in /etc/rc.d/*/ if not Sorcerer using the method described in the LSB.
Yet because it does use a proposed standard method for init-scripts,
Sorcerer has a LSB backward compatible implementation of init-script
handling that is fast, tiny, and eloquent.
The average size of init-scripts is less than 24 lines.

I wanted to discuss the init-scripts because it shows
that the Sorcerer implementation is dedicated to being
simple, powerful, flexible.
I receive my the benefit of my best attempt to keep Sorcerer
boxes on the rails by enforcing that SAs use stock init-scripts.
Yet SAs can still shove back by disabling stock init-scripts
and providing their own.
However, the SA must keep their init-scripts using separate names,
just as custom spells should have separate names,
but use the eprovide to provide the original.

There is plenty of room for compromise for achieving with Sorcerer
the distribution that is more than adequate for the tasks of each
senior level SA.
However, such as having xorg pre-installed,
the boons to one SA may be the banes to another.
And for that reason compromise is required.

I apologize for the inconvenience with deploying Sorcerer
using non qemu virtualization.
The more feedback that is provided about that
the sooner Sorcerer can become more virtualization friendly.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> New server machine is up and running - finally.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some points from new I/R version, regarding its installer. Its a very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hostile toward any virtualization environment...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All current major distros works like a charm under KVM, Xen, VirtualBox,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc. I have tested several distros, Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora. All
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just Works, no major problems, but when i try Sorcerer, i always get it to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mess it up very seriously, installer does do wierd things, no bootloader,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spell depencies are selecting so much packets so i need to scream loudly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to my machine and kick it out of my window.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, i am using Virtualbox thru SSH X11 tunnel, and when i was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installing current Sorcerer I/R its install - option in menu is very bad
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for virtualization environments. First it jammed my whole SSH session to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Virtualbox, then i did fire it up using RDP connection and founded it did
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> say Out of Memory errors, i was using 256MB RAM, so clearly thats not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enough. Then i upgraded it to 512MB and it was enough, i did not bother to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> try eg. 384MB, etc... so i dont know what memory requirements are.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In compile option in installer menu, when i did go thru it, it asked spell
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> selections, etc. i picked up cracklib, but its sources are not in I/R
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discs, so basicily whole system was not installing properly because nice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Auto Failure&quot; feature, so eg. initramfs, init-functions etc, all refused
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to install because i picked cracklib... Including that lilo refused to not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to make /etc/lilo.conf... arf.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Okay when i fixed all those horrible bugs i did manage to start sorcerer,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but why are spell depencies always installing lots of stuff i dont need,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meaning whole X Window/X.org and lots of X Window related spells, like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> media codecs, media players, etc.  I dont want some desktop crap
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installed, i want a very basic tools installed and no listening ports in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> default but currently i would guess its wanting to run some multimedia
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> game pc and lots of ports listening for some services i dont know what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they are (think some services heimdal wants?), so i think we need some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> options what we need to install and what not. Then some basic tools are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> missing in default, like ping command, thats wierd. I love Ubuntu way that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is zero listening daemons when you install it, you have to even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> install openssh-server to get SSH port open, but Sorcerer is a very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different beast, it opens like 10 or more services that i dont even know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what they are, its just so very wrong.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Oh, i almost forgot, network configuration, its just horrible, current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;templates&quot; just suck. I would assume that almost all would need to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> static ip or dhcp, but there are no instructions how to do it, and when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you look general template, its not clear what to do, its very very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> confusing, clearly better templates are needed and installer should also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have support to setup network settings (static, dhcp, etc). Currently i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just love Debian style interfaces configuration, about billion time better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system there than we have right now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Oh yeah this is a rant but journey to get Sorcerer to run under
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> virtualized environment is so full of pain to do and default depencies are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so wrong. Clearly we need to polish installer to work better in different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> environments and to test it much much more to get all bugs out of it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, those spell depencies, i just dont get it why in default after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installation i always to manage to get it to position to have install
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> several GUI stuff, i think we need to get also solution to console only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usage or at least some howto guide how to ban all graphics relates spells
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and howto reset system if whole X Window System / X.org wants to cast but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your dont need it, or you need only basic X.org libraries, not several
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multimedia codecs, players, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Kyle, how many servers is needed, we need to move sorcerer.silverice.org
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and ppr.silverice.org to this new server. If i install one server for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sorcerer.silverice.org and for ppr.silverice.org? Then perhaps another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server where we perhaps can set some automatic way to build new versions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of spells, etc, perhaps third one for testing 64-bit sorcerer?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
