<PRE>The next LAG=0 update or the following update at LAG=1 brings some
interesting changes.
About 30 to 100 installed software projects will recompile
at the same version as already installed.
This will become apparently only after the update is in progress.

This mass fixing happens because the libxcb-xlib library
that was previously installed by libxcb is no longer installed.
Consequently, boxes will have many installed libtool archive files that
reference this missing library and also many libraries and perhaps executables
installed that link with the missing xcb-xlib library yet should not
have been linked with it.
Only libX11 should have linked with it,
but libtool is not that smart of a utility.
Anyway it is a rather large tangle.
However, sorcery will comb it straight without hardly the pain of any
pulled hair.

In contrast binary based distros that are updating across that
will have to re-create hundreds of pre-compiled binary packages
that boxes would have to download and install.
But with Sorcerer installed software that must be fixed
is merely recompiled from the previously acquired sources.
This is one of those times that amounts to a significant savings in bandwidth.

Still because of the amount of software that will probably be recompiled
please do not do start this update with little disk space available.
Due to some oddities in the way LA files were created
some LA files will not be properly identified as broke by the LA check.
Therefore, if the update must be restarted midway again
then be sure to recast libxcb also so that all the effected
*.la files will be discovered and the software which owns those files
will be reinstalled.

Have fun.
And I posted this to message to the list to avoid the usual questions
about why software that is already installed is being reinstalled.
This time the finger can be pointed at libxcb and libtool software authors.
sorcery just cleans up the mess that the update creates.
