<PRE>Hi there .

I, for one am glad that someone else is actually trying to install Sorerer
from the I/R and running in to a few issues.
Without trying to flame, I would like to add my bit.

The installer does need a little work. We should all test it a little more
and give more feedback to Kyle in order to get it in a good enough shape to
compete with the other installers out there.

I agree that the Sorcerer I/R should be as small as possible. In my mind, as
long as you have a working Sorcerer that is network aware, you can cast
anything you want. This approach has the added benefit of only installing
what you need.

I do not agree with having the option to select any spell for which you do
not have sources until Sorcerer is installed and network aware.

Lastly, by avoiding the skillcheck of compiling a custom kernel, we now have
a much bigger skillcheck when trying to do anything a little different with
the install, like a virtual environment, installing on removable media like
usb hard drives. There should, at the very least be some clear guidelines on
how to go from linux-modular to linux. Since I am the person that managed
this a few times, I'll try to re-install and at least write this little bit
of documentation.


I wish you all a very nice day.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> New server machine is up and running - finally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some points from new I/R version, regarding its installer. Its a very
</I>&gt;<i> hostile toward any virtualization environment...
</I>&gt;<i> All current major distros works like a charm under KVM, Xen, VirtualBox,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. I have tested several distros, Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora. All Just
</I>&gt;<i> Works, no major problems, but when i try Sorcerer, i always get it to mess
</I>&gt;<i> it up very seriously, installer does do wierd things, no bootloader, spell
</I>&gt;<i> depencies are selecting so much packets so i need to scream loudly to my
</I>&gt;<i> machine and kick it out of my window.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, i am using Virtualbox thru SSH X11 tunnel, and when i was
</I>&gt;<i> installing current Sorcerer I/R its install - option in menu is very bad for
</I>&gt;<i> virtualization environments. First it jammed my whole SSH session to
</I>&gt;<i> Virtualbox, then i did fire it up using RDP connection and founded it did
</I>&gt;<i> say Out of Memory errors, i was using 256MB RAM, so clearly thats not
</I>&gt;<i> enough. Then i upgraded it to 512MB and it was enough, i did not bother to
</I>&gt;<i> try eg. 384MB, etc... so i dont know what memory requirements are.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In compile option in installer menu, when i did go thru it, it asked spell
</I>&gt;<i> selections, etc. i picked up cracklib, but its sources are not in I/R discs,
</I>&gt;<i> so basicily whole system was not installing properly because nice &quot;Auto
</I>&gt;<i> Failure&quot; feature, so eg. initramfs, init-functions etc, all refused to
</I>&gt;<i> install because i picked cracklib... Including that lilo refused to not to
</I>&gt;<i> make /etc/lilo.conf... arf.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay when i fixed all those horrible bugs i did manage to start sorcerer,
</I>&gt;<i> but why are spell depencies always installing lots of stuff i dont need,
</I>&gt;<i> meaning whole X Window/X.org and lots of X Window related spells, like media
</I>&gt;<i> codecs, media players, etc.  I dont want some desktop crap installed, i want
</I>&gt;<i> a very basic tools installed and no listening ports in default but currently
</I>&gt;<i> i would guess its wanting to run some multimedia game pc and lots of ports
</I>&gt;<i> listening for some services i dont know what they are (think some services
</I>&gt;<i> heimdal wants?), so i think we need some options what we need to install and
</I>&gt;<i> what not. Then some basic tools are missing in default, like ping command,
</I>&gt;<i> thats wierd. I love Ubuntu way that there is zero listening daemons when you
</I>&gt;<i> install it, you have to even install openssh-server to get SSH port open,
</I>&gt;<i> but Sorcerer is a very different beast, it opens like 10 or more services
</I>&gt;<i> that i dont even know what they are, its just so very wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, i almost forgot, network configuration, its just horrible, current
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;templates&quot; just suck. I would assume that almost all would need to use
</I>&gt;<i> static ip or dhcp, but there are no instructions how to do it, and when you
</I>&gt;<i> look general template, its not clear what to do, its very very confusing,
</I>&gt;<i> clearly better templates are needed and installer should also have support
</I>&gt;<i> to setup network settings (static, dhcp, etc). Currently i just love Debian
</I>&gt;<i> style interfaces configuration, about billion time better system there than
</I>&gt;<i> we have right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh yeah this is a rant but journey to get Sorcerer to run under virtualized
</I>&gt;<i> environment is so full of pain to do and default depencies are so wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly we need to polish installer to work better in different environments
</I>&gt;<i> and to test it much much more to get all bugs out of it. Also, those spell
</I>&gt;<i> depencies, i just dont get it why in default after installation i always to
</I>&gt;<i> manage to get it to position to have install several GUI stuff, i think we
</I>&gt;<i> need to get also solution to console only usage or at least some howto guide
</I>&gt;<i> how to ban all graphics relates spells and howto reset system if whole X
</I>&gt;<i> Window System / X.org wants to cast but your dont need it, or you need only
</I>&gt;<i> basic X.org libraries, not several multimedia codecs, players, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kyle, how many servers is needed, we need to move sorcerer.silverice.organd
</I>&gt;<i> ppr.silverice.org to this new server. If i install one server for
</I>&gt;<i> sorcerer.silverice.org and for ppr.silverice.org? Then perhaps another
</I>&gt;<i> server where we perhaps can set some automatic way to build new versions of
</I>&gt;<i> spells, etc, perhaps third one for testing 64-bit sorcerer?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>  whaow what a flame shoot ;)
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with some point like the fact that after install there shall be
</I>&gt;<i> only terminal application installed
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't review the network templates for a while, but last time I checked
</I>&gt;<i> it I was a little bit confused, since I can now read bash I looked further
</I>&gt;<i> and then understood... but maybe a template per feature supported might be
</I>&gt;<i> better.... let say instead of a &quot;generic&quot; into links then a dhcp, a static
</I>&gt;<i> ethernet, a static wlan....
</I>&gt;<i> the network template seems to be readable and then I don't think it shall
</I>&gt;<i> be &quot;improved&quot; right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this is only a clue but if I look about others installers like ubuntu one,
</I>&gt;<i> it simply duplicate the cd content onto the new root partition and update
</I>&gt;<i> boot loader, so basically after install you have exactly the same OS than on
</I>&gt;<i> the CD, I think this is better approach, I used this method to create the
</I>&gt;<i> usb recovery disk (much more usefull from my point of view than a CD, it's
</I>&gt;<i> small and don't scratch ;) )
</I>&gt;<i> so basically I think that a better way to install and simplier way is to
</I>&gt;<i> duplicate the CD/usb content on the drive
</I>&gt;<i> like this you start from a totaly clean env, without preselected
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies, btw is there any augur command that &quot;forget&quot; an optional
</I>&gt;<i> requirement on all spell allready configured?
</I>&gt;<i> ie something that do
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # augur forgetopt xinetd
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> forgetopt () {
</I>&gt;<i>     for spell in $(grep -l ${1} /etc/sorcery/log/opt.on); do
</I>&gt;<i>          sed -i &quot;s:${1}::g&quot; ${spell};
</I>&gt;<i>          echo &quot;${1}&quot; &gt;&gt; ${spell/opt.on/opt.off}
</I>&gt;<i>     done
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> best regards
