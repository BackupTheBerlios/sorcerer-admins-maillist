<PRE>I have nothing against using grub.
Someone who uses grub should write the support for it.
I use lilo.
That is why the initramfs support and integration with lilo is excellent.
Unlike grub that must be installed in the MBR
lilo can be installed both in boot blocks or the MBR.

Edit /etc/lilo.conf*
Please remember that /etc/lilo.conf and /etc/lilo.conf.fast
are constructed files and therefore to properly make the change
also /etc/lilo.conf.head must be adjusted.
Chance the boot = to specify the entire disk instead of a partition.
So instead of /dev/sda1 use /dev/sda
Instead of /dev/hda1 use /dev/hda
Run lilo
Look for error messages.
Reboot.
Enter BIOS/CMOS setup menu
Make certain that disk is on the boot list.
Continue booting.

It is true that I do not present an option about where to install lilo
in the menu driven installer.
It selects the boot block of /boot if /boot is definied
or the boot block of /
However, that should be sufficient for installation.
After the first reboot just use the above steps.
Two lilos will be installed.
However, since booting runs the MBR first
the lilo in the MBR will run.
In order to return to using the lilo in a boot block
a ms-sys bootable MBR must be installed in the MBR.
