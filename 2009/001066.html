<PRE>Looking at /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/ on an I/R's initramfs I see that..
S08mdadm*
S13vgchange
S14cryptsetup

Software raids start first,
then logical volumes are started
and finally encryption is started.
So apparently service that starts later
can encapsulate the service that starts earlier.
Consequently, applying LUKS encryption to a
logical volume should be possible.

swap does not start until runlevels.
It is often activated first when the runlevel begins.
runlevels begin after sysinit finishes.
Therefore, having swap on a software RAID, LVM, or encrypted
should be possible if it is supported.
If I remember correctly LVM is simply a front end,
a complicated one at that, to the device mapper.
And the device mapper is used to partition disks,
but not in the traditional method of partitioning.
Having an LUKS encrypted swap works.
It is support in linux.
The designated luks swap partition is initialized with
a random key on each boot.
Since LUKS can work ontop of LVM this combination should be possible.
However, I do not recall testing if swap can be made directly
on a LVM logical volume.
Logically, I would expect it to be so.  :)
But it does require testing.

The order of software raids, LVM2, and LUKS on Sorcerer
is probably different than any other distro.
I selected this order so that if an encrypted filesystem
were to span two or more physical volumes
then each volume would not require a separate password prompt
and/or separate password.
However, it has not been extensively tested.
I usually use either regular partitions, LUKS encrypted partitions,
or LVM2, but not a combination of the above .

However, if it is indeed set up correctly
then Sorcerer should support any of the sophisticated
partitioning, volume management, and encryption that
is available on most any distribution.
However, evms is not supported!
Also, different encryption methods other than LUKS
are not supported by the menu driven installer.
However, you can use them if desired, such as using
the cryptloop device to create a looped back encrypted
filesystem out of a file, partition, or logical device.

As with most things about POSIX systems,
there is usually more than one way to do it,
and not just one &quot;correct&quot; way.
Also there is no good substitution for just playing
with it to gain a feel for how it works.
Even reading the manual pages for LVM2 is rather confusing.
What's a logical group, logical volume, physical volume?
I barely remember.
But once one sets up a LVM2 style deployment a few times
then it becomes almost intuitive.

Encrypted root filesystem in conjunction with a CMOS password,
and decent lilo password is a good combination for a notebook.
For a secret or higher level notebook and/or workstation
then I also recommend using an encrypted swap.
Given sufficient RAM, 3G 4G, most Sorcerer boxes will do
almost no swapping.
Yet still disk caching and buffering can be improved on those boxes,
by having some swap space so that RAM that remains nearly unused
while a box is running can be swapped to disk and thus become available
for other more important uses.

On a dual core or quad core box
the impact of an encrypted root filesystem is nearly negligible
since there is almost always spare CPU available for handling the encryption.
That is nice to know.
Also it is nearly impossible to buy a new notebook computer
that is not a SMP core.
That is also why the x86_64 linux-modular configuration only
has the SMP configuration and not a separate non SMP configuration.

Sorcerer is a decent operating system to use in an environment where
one's bytes must remain safe.
However, it does not have completed support for selinux.
However, not many SAs would be able to configure and deploy
a selinux enabled box properly to maximize the security benefits.

Jan might know the answers to the suspend/resume questions.
I know nothing bout suspend/resume,
except that a suspend/resume swap partition
must not be an encrypted partition.

Shutting down a Sorcerer box properly and restarting it,
is not such a dangerous nor long process provided that
the /boot partition did not run out of space while generating initramfs images.
A full suspend to disk is not a necessity on a notebook,
especially where security is paramount!
A suspend to disk would write the entire contents of RAM
unencrypted to the suspend/swap partition.
This is counter-intuitive to having encrypted filesystems!
Consequently, I recommend either:
a non encrypted deployment that can suspend to disk;
or an encrypted deployment that can not suspend to disk.

Lastly, remember that if a notebook goes out of one's possession
that someone could tamper with the initramfs and linux kernel
that reside on the unencrypted boot partition.
There is one way to prevent that!
Keep a separate USB drive key for booting that is only plugged
into the notebook when the notebook is booted.
Soon as the notebook is booted,
and assuming no updates linux are required,
umount /boot and remove the USB key.
This way the entire contents of the notebook disk drives can be encrypted,
while the only unencrypted bytes are store on the USB key which is kept
normally separated from the notebook.
This way if the notebook, but not USB key,
go out of possession and then return
the data on the notebook will have not been compromised
nor adjusted so that the notebook can be rooted on the next boot.
Fun huh?

Yes users that share a notebook can have separate personal USB keys.
But they would all have to know the LUKS password for the / partition
unless each has separate encrypted partitions that they can use.
However, I seriously doubt with the low expense of notebook computers
that a company would share the deployment of notebooks among users.

If one uses a separate USB key for booting a notebook,
please make a dd backup of that key onto another key.
We all know how having just one key tends tends to invite
the problem of a key being lost or damaged.
Also, with the Sorcerer method for LUKS encryption,
LUKS encrypted filesystems receive their password from
a prompt made to the SA during boot.
Yes, the actual password key is not stored on disk in a file.
Memorize the password and swallow the paper.  :)
Just joking about eating the paper.
However, it is good to know that the merely having
an encrypted notebook and USB key to boot it is not
enough to boot the box and gain access to the encrypted / filesystem.
However, if anyone gains possession to the unencrypted USB key,
that can be compromised so that on a future boot the notebook
could be rooted while running.

Someone might know about notebooks that have fixed disk encryption
where a password is promoted for during the BIOS portion of boot.
Those notebooks might be more secure than can be achieved using
LUKS software encryption provided with Sorcerer.
However, I do not know what notebooks come with
hardware encryption for the fixed disks.

I saw a cute tiny notebook with a solid state drive at the other day.
Looks like a little toy.
Has only meager 16G drive.
But it is a step in the direction towards disk less portables.
It would be usable by someone with eagle eyed vision and
would not mind attaching a USB external drive,
or as an email / websurfing box?
