<PRE>Hi,
that's not so easy
some spell have runtime dependencies on tools usually used for compilation
this is the case of enblend that require make to run.... although 
enblend is only doing photo stiching... but it use make to perform the 
tasks.

however there is a small an efficient way :

discard_req() { return 0; }

if [ -n ${ARCH} ]; then
    alias build_requirement=discard_req
else
    alias build_requirement=requirement
fi


I assume that a user that is cross compiling has all the build 
requirement installed and that sorcery hasn't to track them, a command 
augur build_req can be implemented easely to display build requirements
this imply that if crosscompiling or creating a rescue disc, the 
buildrequirements are simply droped.

best regards
JLM

</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; long time ago I discussed about that.... I know that some of you
</I>&gt;<i>     don't
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; see difference between both... I see lot of differences and
</I>&gt;<i>     would like
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; to have 2 requirements in spells :
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;  - build requirements are what is mandatory to build the spell,
</I>&gt;<i>     not to
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; run it, a build requirement can be removed from the system without
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; causing a crash, however it has to be present on build
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;  - run requirements is what is mandatory to run without a crash
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; why do I come back?
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; I want to use core spell to build automaticaly and usb rescue drive
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; using what is on drive, looking at the graph I provided I saw lot of
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; spells that aren't mandatory for running the rescue disc, like cmake
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; that cause gcc-v4.1 to be installed as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     cmake has no requirement on gcc-v4.1!
</I>&gt;<i>     I edited that out of the spell and put a comment in it
</I>&gt;<i>     to prevent anyone from adding that to cmake.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; ... AFAIK gcc-v4.1 and cmake
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; can be rebuild from gcc... so they don't have to be on the
</I>&gt;<i>     rescue disk
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; as well there is a difference when doing crosscompiling (and
</I>&gt;<i>     this is one
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; of the reason I couldn't go further on crosscompiling) because a
</I>&gt;<i>     build
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; requirement is a software that have to be run on host, then have
</I>&gt;<i>     to be
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; compiled for host arch and then should not be put on target FS....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     If anything did require something that required something
</I>&gt;<i>     that required something that required cmake and cmake required
</I>&gt;<i>     gcc-v4.1
</I>&gt;<i>     then the compilation of that end something would also require gcc-v4.1
</I>&gt;<i>     to be installed.
</I>&gt;<i>     Therefore, the requirement chains must be without broken links
</I>&gt;<i>     when it comes to having installed software.
</I>&gt;<i>     This is especially important when it comes to doing any compilation
</I>&gt;<i>     of software during the installation of the I/R.
</I>&gt;<i>     Since the network is not yet configured by the SA
</I>&gt;<i>     new source tarballs can not simply be downloaded as required.
</I>&gt;<i>     All that are available on the I/R is all that can be compiled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; as well I find strange that some spell have dependencies upon
</I>&gt;<i>     autotools
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; (automake and autoconf) since all autotooled package have a pecular
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; version of autotools built-in.... thoses spells are only
</I>&gt;<i>     required if you
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; want to create a software that use autotools, else you don't require
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; them normaly
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Some sources do require libtool or autoconf or automake installed.
</I>&gt;<i>     Many sources have enough in their tree to compile without having
</I>&gt;<i>     the above 3 spells installed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     There are two reasons that Sorcerer has only required and optional
</I>&gt;<i>     spells
</I>&gt;<i>     and not build required and run-time required spells.
</I>&gt;<i>     The first reason is simplicity.
</I>&gt;<i>     The current system is simple and fast.
</I>&gt;<i>     Because it does not try to do anything complicated
</I>&gt;<i>     it tends to work properly.
</I>&gt;<i>     If it were to do fancy stuff
</I>&gt;<i>     then unanticipated problems could occur.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The second reason is that Sorcerer boxes must update.
</I>&gt;<i>     Because Sorcerer boxes update there is a good chance
</I>&gt;<i>     that over time every installed spell will recompile.
</I>&gt;<i>     If nearly all the installed software will recompile
</I>&gt;<i>     then the build requirements will be needed again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     There is not normally a good reason to have
</I>&gt;<i>     spells required only for compilation to not be installed.
</I>&gt;<i>     Let us examine gcc and make for examples.
</I>&gt;<i>     Feel free to dispel them.
</I>&gt;<i>     A box does not require thme to run.
</I>&gt;<i>     But if a box lacks archives for them
</I>&gt;<i>     then what will will be required when it is time to update?
</I>&gt;<i>     Almost nothing can cast without gcc installed.
</I>&gt;<i>     What can parase makefiles if make is not installed?
</I>&gt;<i>     Allowing SAs to dispel gcc and make is not a convenience.
</I>&gt;<i>     It is a delayed super head-ache!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     They day will come when they say,
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;Oh that was dumb, why did I dispel gcc?
</I>&gt;<i>     I require it now for updates.
</I>&gt;<i>     I have to manually install it from the I/R
</I>&gt;<i>     Oh wait, that is an older gcc.
</I>&gt;<i>     Now I have to compile it again.
</I>&gt;<i>     At least my c++ programs did not quit starting,
</I>&gt;<i>     thanks to the libstdc++ libraries stored in the library cache.
</I>&gt;<i>     Ah, I installed the older gcc provided on the I/R.
</I>&gt;<i>     Great.
</I>&gt;<i>     But now my c++ program will not run due to missing symbols.
</I>&gt;<i>     They require the newer libstdc++ provided by the newer gcc.
</I>&gt;<i>     Ah, I have to compile gcc first before I can do anything.
</I>&gt;<i>     I wish I had just left it installed to begin with.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Even if SAs could save 300M on a installed system
</I>&gt;<i>     by being able to dispel build only requirements
</I>&gt;<i>     they would soon come to regret the decision
</I>&gt;<i>     for blowing big holes that must be repaired
</I>&gt;<i>     before the box can update properly again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Sorcerer is about going seamlessly from the past,
</I>&gt;<i>     to the present, to the future.
</I>&gt;<i>     We do not redeploy our boxes every other year.
</I>&gt;<i>     We simply update them on a regular basis
</I>&gt;<i>     and deal with the tiny inconveniences that happen
</I>&gt;<i>     instead of a giant headache when a new release
</I>&gt;<i>     of a pre-compiled binary based distro can not install
</I>&gt;<i>     or can not run properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Do you not hate when you backup your box,
</I>&gt;<i>     wipe your filesystems, go to re-install a new distro release
</I>&gt;<i>     and then realize that the boot floppies are useless
</I>&gt;<i>     and that a week elapses before the distro maintainers
</I>&gt;<i>     announce the problem and provide fixed floppies
</I>&gt;<i>     while all that time you wondered if it was your lack of ability?
</I>&gt;<i>     Or what about having finished installing the new release of a distro
</I>&gt;<i>     and then suddenly discovering that ppp front-end program
</I>&gt;<i>     segmentation faults and so you are uncertain how to establish
</I>&gt;<i>     a modem connection to the Internet Service Provide to obtain a fix
</I>&gt;<i>     for it.
</I>&gt;<i>     A decade ago when I was more or less a regular SA
</I>&gt;<i>     stuff like that happened and I did not like it.
</I>&gt;<i>     If anyone thought Sorcerer had some bad bugs...
</I>&gt;<i>     Major distros were major pains back then.
</I>&gt;<i>     Any bad thing you can imagine happening and more
</I>&gt;<i>     has already happened in distros such as Debian and RedHat.
</I>&gt;<i>     Oh yes, they also have derail boxes
</I>&gt;<i>     causing them to be unable to update.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Sorcerer is not perfect.
</I>&gt;<i>     But I try to provide quick fixes
</I>&gt;<i>     and minimize the impact of problems,
</I>&gt;<i>     even when the problems are being caused
</I>&gt;<i>     by other software authors and not me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The question about having build-only requirements is
</I>&gt;<i>     not &quot;Can we do it?&quot;  The question is &quot;Should we do it?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     Sorcerer offers SAs too much freedom already.
</I>&gt;<i>     SAs that do not understand the select menu in sorcery
</I>&gt;<i>     have uninstalled a large portion of installed software
</I>&gt;<i>     breaking their boxes bad and
</I>&gt;<i>     then they blame me for it.
</I>&gt;<i>     I still have not thought of a solution for the select menu
</I>&gt;<i>     that offers the same amount of power, but with a margin for safety.
</I>&gt;<i>     Instead I figure that for the time being a portion of SAs
</I>&gt;<i>     will wreck their boxes using the select menu in sorcery.
</I>&gt;<i>     Oh well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     But my point is that Sorcerer should be helping SAs
</I>&gt;<i>     properly load their box with software
</I>&gt;<i>     and not providing new methods for creating
</I>&gt;<i>     problematic holes in the installed software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I hate to seem so uncompromising about it.
</I>&gt;<i>     However, having separate concepts of build and
</I>&gt;<i>     runtime requirements is something borrowed from
</I>&gt;<i>     pre-compiled binary based distros.
</I>&gt;<i>     They even have dev packages that must be installed
</I>&gt;<i>     in order to provide required header files for compilation.
</I>&gt;<i>     It is too annoying!
</I>&gt;<i>     Yet my point is that Sorcerer should never have the
</I>&gt;<i>     same benefits as a pre-compiled binary based distro does,
</I>&gt;<i>     because Sorcerer would have to sacrifice too much
</I>&gt;<i>     of what makes Sorcerer an excellent source based distribution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Sorcerer, as it is, fits the paradigm of a source based distro.
</I>&gt;<i>     To add support for build-only requirements adds elements
</I>&gt;<i>     of a pre-compiled binary based distro to Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i>     That also forces sorcery to change to fit the hybrid paradigm.
</I>&gt;<i>     Ultimately sorcery becomes slower, more complex, and more problematic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I take a stand against the hybridization of Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i>     only to keep Sorcerer excellent at what Sorcerer does.
</I>&gt;<i>     A dog that goes &quot;meow&quot; just is not the same thing as a dog or a cat.
</I>&gt;<i>     Who wants a  duck that goes &quot;moo?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     Sorcerer is like a duck that goes quack.
</I>&gt;<i>     SAs know what to expect.
</I>&gt;<i>     It soars in the air.
</I>&gt;<i>     It floats in the water.
</I>&gt;<i>     But it is not a ground sprinter like a road runner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Some SAs like Sorcerer, but simply can not part with
</I>&gt;<i>     the awesome conveniences provided by pre-compiled binary base distros.
</I>&gt;<i>     Some demand that nearly instant download and installation of
</I>&gt;<i>     pre-compiled binary packages that require practically no CPU cylces
</I>&gt;<i>     as compared to compiling software.
</I>&gt;<i>     The request for me to provide pre-compiled binary packages
</I>&gt;<i>     for download has crossed the Sorcerer email list several times.
</I>&gt;<i>     My answer to that was that SAs which want Sorcerer,
</I>&gt;<i>     yet want that instant gratification should install
</I>&gt;<i>     zero-install-injector.
</I>&gt;<i>     In recent years I have switched to providing more pre-installed
</I>&gt;<i>     spells on the Install/Rescue disks.
</I>&gt;<i>     It is still just a minor fraction compared to what Sorcerer can offer,
</I>&gt;<i>     yet it provides at least a small head start towards achieving
</I>&gt;<i>     the fully deployed box that the SA desires.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Some concessions are permitted as long as Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i>     continues to follow the paradigm of a source based distro.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     My guess-timation is that most SAs that use Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i>     will not want build-only requirements and have no use
</I>&gt;<i>     for such a distinction.
</I>&gt;<i>     And they would be considerable upset with me if
</I>&gt;<i>     I break sorcery trying to hack a more complicated
</I>&gt;<i>     implementation to provide build-only requirements.
</I>&gt;<i>     The current sorcery tools are mostly reliable and
</I>&gt;<i>     already extremely fast.
</I>&gt;<i>     It's the &quot;good-stuff&quot; that we have been waiting to use for years.
</I>&gt;<i>     Now is a good time to enjoy it instead of trying to graft on a 3rd
</I>&gt;<i>     arm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     However, that said you can still blow holes in your installation.
</I>&gt;<i>     Simply use the prohibited --unsafe parameter when issuing a dispel
</I>&gt;<i>     command.
</I>&gt;<i>     However, I can not guarantee that when it comes time to update the box
</I>&gt;<i>     that sorcery will not try to restore spells that were remove which
</I>&gt;<i>     should have been installed.
</I>&gt;<i>     Also there could be big problems if something like gcc and make
</I>&gt;<i>     are dispelled.
</I>&gt;<i>     Thanks to the library cache those problems will not appear
</I>&gt;<i>     immediately.
</I>&gt;<i>     But they might happen when update time comes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Given the current load-out of the I/R
</I>&gt;<i>     it is possible to create suitable Install/Rescue images
</I>&gt;<i>     on memory sticks of size 512M and greater.
</I>&gt;<i>     Might be difficult to buy one that is less than 1G these days.
</I>&gt;<i>     There is no need to shrink Sorcerer down to embedded size.
</I>&gt;<i>     If that were required then a
</I>&gt;<i>     pre-compiled distro based on uClibc and busybox would be better.
</I>&gt;<i>     I have played with uClibc and busybox before.
</I>&gt;<i>     They are fun and fast.
</I>&gt;<i>     Building embedded systems is fun and interesting.
</I>&gt;<i>     Perhaps one could use a mach kernel instead of linux.
</I>&gt;<i>     linux, especially modern linux, is a bit heavy and large.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Sorcerer is like a big beautiful full sized duck,
</I>&gt;<i>     and not a tiny bathtub rubber ducky.
</I>&gt;<i>     Sorcerer evolves and grows and sometimes quacks.
</I>&gt;<i>     Overall I like it.
</I>&gt;<i>     But trying to make it like a bathtub ducky will
</I>&gt;<i>     probably only make it a dead duck.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In the future some hybridization of Sorcerer may be possible.
</I>&gt;<i>     For example there is no benefit for having linux-modular compiled
</I>&gt;<i>     on a box.
</I>&gt;<i>     Any IA32 compiled linux-modular aught to work on any IA32 box.
</I>&gt;<i>     The same goes for the x86_64 linux-modular.
</I>&gt;<i>     It has no ELF requirements to complicate it.
</I>&gt;<i>     And a long time is required to compile linux-modular.
</I>&gt;<i>     Therefore, if enough SAs reported that they wanted
</I>&gt;<i>     an additional spell such as linux-modular-bin
</I>&gt;<i>     then I would consider it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     There are a few spells already such as jdk and OOo-bin
</I>&gt;<i>     where we use pre-compiled binaries instead of compiling it.
</I>&gt;<i>     Complete hybridization of Sorcerer would be bad.
</I>&gt;<i>     However, some areas can be compromised.
</I>&gt;<i>     Sometimes imperfect solutions work best in this imperfect world.
</I>&gt;<i>     But still we must be careful to not make changes that
</I>&gt;<i>     become future problems.
