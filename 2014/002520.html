<PRE>I officially acknowledge Evert Vorster's departure.
Few Captain have have served with a more capable first mate.
Evert was the best teammate I have known.

By now everyone already knows that Evert's contributions
are mostly quality control and bug reporting.
However, that does not exclude requesting features.
We owe plenty of fine features to Evert's requests.

Already before departing;
Evert posted a bug report about /etc/init.d/hub
not moving a wireless network interface to a realfs.
The bug was because the interface name contained lo.
Therefore, it was being filtered out of the list of interfaces to move
as if it was the loop back interface.
A sloppy sed statement I wrote
created the possibility for that bug to occur.

Consequently, that is the nature of the available opening.
It involves bug reports and testing new code
after I test it to spot bugs that I missed.
Basically, it becomes the difference between implementations
and technics becoming 85% bug free and 95% bug free.
Without such assistance; expect to feel that drop in quality.

There is no application, no contract, no commitment,
and no formal arrangement concerning this position.
The person who wants to do it, does it.
So if a bug does not become fixed after a week
then expect that I am unaware and send a report please.
Bugs that I fail to spot will persist until reported.
