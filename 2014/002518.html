<PRE>And for the official reply.  *teeheehee*  ;)
Choice was not eroded.
Choice was granted.

A SA can easily disable automatic optimization.
The cpref system, already known by experienced SAs,
can be used to set compiler optimization for one or more
or all technics.

Automatic optimization is merely an alternative for SAs
that wish to avoid the burden of consideration optimization
and yet reap the benefits of rapid installation followed by
eventually receiving optimization over time.

If a computer is to be deployed for 5 years,
and it does not receive optimization until after the first
update a month following deployment
then it still benefits from optimization for 59 / 60 months
or approximately, 98.3% of it's deployment duration.

And to state that it is without optimization for the first month is
inaccurate.
The software provided on the DI receives compiler optimization.
Yet it is not optimized for the exact microprocessor upon which
the DI is deployed.
To optimize for the exact microprocessor requires a rebuild
or for sufficient time to elapse such that updates are provided
for all of the software provided on the DI.

So with consideration of that aspect
the norm for gaining near optimal optimization
tends to require re-compilation of installed software.

The optimization is probably not worth the additional compilation duration.
BASH compiled with optimization can loop approximately
4% faster than BASH compiled with optimization.
Yet changing the locale from en_US.utf8 to C
allows unoptimized BASH to complete the same loop 20% faster.
That illustrates two things.
First, the programmer's skill impacts performance
more significantly than compiler optimization.
Second, without BASH installed completing
a hundred thousand loops with BASH requires an infinite duration.
Therefore, better to have software installed
than to not have software installed.

The main advantage of a source based POSIX was never optimization.
Nearly every decent POSIX will run within about plus or minus 5 percent
in terms of performance.
Even a pre-compiled binary package based POSIX for i686
is not a bad choice for an x86_64 computer with only 3G or less installed
RAM.
We know that to be so because 64-bit integers and 64-bit pointers
consume more processing cycles than 32-bit integers and 32-bit pointers.

The main advantage of a source based POSIX is to be able
to have software patched, configured, compiled, linked, and installed
exactly the way that a SA desires.
Achieving that requires a custom technic.
New SAs doing new deployments, not by cloning deployed boxes,
but by using the DI and deployment docent
probably do not have a pre-prepared catalog of local technics.
Instead they are eagerly awaiting installation to see
if it works and what it is like.
So if they intend to deploy production machines with it
then they will probably run a realfs for a month,
maybe do a rebuilt on it adjust the manifest a few times
before finally cloning it into new computers.
They will not at all be inconvenienced by rapid installation of software.
But if they are; then cprefs can provide the solution.

I originally replied off list,
because I was baffled by something.
And I am writing an on-list reply now to avoid appearing
as if I utterly ignored the feedback.
I sometimes reply in private and
that does create the appearance
that conversation threads abruptly died.

I appreciate the communication because
feedback is what helps make a fun and useful POSIX.
If nobody requested something
that I eventually interpreted to be best supplied
with a NAT daemon and mobile intracomputer network hub
then those changes would not have become.
So if anyone thinks, &quot;Well it's about damn time.&quot;
Then drink a toast to Evert for making the request.

&gt;<i>From time to time Evert and I
</I>might appear to be seated at opposite ends of a long table.
However, we manage to accomplish beneficial change,
because we each form separate opinions and strive
to understand the validity of the other person's opinions.
Sometimes both opinions may be valid
and that can seem as if no compromise can exist,
and yet benefit still becomes from the communication.
Such demonstrates that consensus
is not nearly as important as compassion.

My understanding from the off-list discussion
was that we both have opinions concerning
choice where the opinion about a decision differs.
For example, did the multi-root implementation deprive choice?

The actual network interface has always been
in the rootfs net name space.
The multi-root implementation created unshared net name space
for all realfs and granted VETH to each
and created an an intracomputer network hub in the rootfs.
And thus the location of the actual network interfaces
remained unchanged.

Yet from a different perspective any fluffy GUI program
used to configure the actual network interface required extra
steps to be able to configure the interface in the rootfs net name space.
So from that perspective the implementation deprived a choice
or deprived a convenience.

Both opinions or points of view are valid.
Consensus was not achieved.
And yet a NAT daemon and
mobile intracomputer network hub was achieved.

That is not atypical for progress.
Do not be surprised by the lack of consensus.
It is far better than languishing with complacency.
Although I will always keep my intrahub located on the rootfs
I feel pleased to be able to offer the choice for SAs.
It is an improvement.
