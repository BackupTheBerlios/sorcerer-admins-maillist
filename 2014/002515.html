<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Most of us already realized that the realfs, or root file systems,
of a computer all have a VETH.
And the rootfs has many VETH.
That makes the rootfs the hub.
The VETH are network tunnels.
And one end of a VETH tunnel is in the hub
and the other is in another unshared net namespace.

Evert expressed the desire for having
actual network interfaces in a realfs net namespace.
That way an interface can be configured with fluffy GUI programs.

And while I expressed my dislike for moving the hub
from the rootfs to a realfs; I admitted that it was possible.
And so I coded it.

# /etc/init.d/hub configure

Running that will set the location of the hub.
It can be rootfs or any realfs such as /+/base/
If not specified the hub will remain the rootfs.

While making the changes I realized something.
Whenever the IP address of the actual network interface changes
then the DNAT and SNAT rules must also change.
The easiest way to accomplish that was a reboot.
So I changed it.

A NAT daemon now runs in rootfs.
However, it configures the DNAT and SNAT rules
for wherever the hub is located.
Every 20s it awakes and checks the IP address
for the actual network interface.
If it changes then the former DNAT and SNAT rules
are deleted and new DNAT and SNAT rules are input.
The NAT daemon provides a convenience
for a mobile computer sliding from network to network
using wpa_supplicant.

init-scripts for wpa_supplicant and immune-auto-network were adjusted.
They run both during sysinit and runlevel.
During runlevel they have no effect
if an actual network interface
is not present in the realfs.
Therefore, if /etc/init.d/hub moves the hub into a realfs
then it also moves the actual network interfaces also.
Therefore, the actual network interfaces must be reconfigured
during runlevel if moved from rootfs to a realfs.

So can wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli and dhcpcd be restarted
from /+/work/ if /+/work is the hub?
The answer is yes.
The only aspect about networking that does not support
the moveable hub is /etc/init.d/networks which is more useful
for static network configurations.

The computer's network hub is similar to an airport hub.
Packets destined to go out to the Internet leave a realfs
and then travel to the hub and then from the hub have
the address translated to the same as the actual network interface
and then travel out that interface along the default route
until reaching the next hop which exists outside of the computer.
Likewise if someone wanted to fly from Texas to Nevada
then a direct flight to Las Vegas might not be available.
The person might fly first to Atlanta Georgia and then board
an airplane destined for Las Vegas.
The use of a hub conserves the amount of airplanes that must be utilized.
Likewise a computer's network hub conserves the amount of
VETH and IP address that must be utilized.

Feel invited to inquire if more questions exist.
I want to keep this email reasonably terse.
The important aspect is that those who want
the actual network interface available
for fluffy configuration GUIs can move it.
Yet be aware that the location of the hub suffers
from weakened network security.
Always better to have the hub in rootfs net namespace
if no compelling reason exists for moving it elsewhere.

This email describes changes that will be available
soon within a day or two from the time this email was written.
