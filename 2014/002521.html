<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>features have changed.
Have a look at
# au help feature

atimes for files are disabled by default.
If desired then the atime feature enables atimes.

makej is now a feature toggle.
I hate parallel make, or to be more precise...
Parallel make requires makefiles with proper rules.
However, not all software projects provide makefiles
with the proper rules for parallel make.
Then when one part completes in parallel make
sooner than it would in linear make
then compilation ends with an error.

SAs that want to chase after compile errors
caused by inadequate makefiles are invited
to enable the makej feature.
However, I am turning it off.
I will no longer add the makej trait to technics.
I will only remove makej trait
when someone reports that it is problematic.
I prefer that we all forget about parallel make FOREVER,
because not all software authors are testing
their makefiles for proper compatibility with parallel make.

colorized messages are enabled by default.
Enable the monochrome feature if color codes are not desired.

Automatic optimization is switching to my preference.
The conservation of RAM by -Os increases performance
not merely by swapping less, but more importantly
by page faulting less.
Anytime 4K of RAM is required; Linux page faults.
Less page faulting allows more processing.

The dubious benefit of link time optimization
mostly seems to produce smaller code that runs slower.
Testing LTO requires additional testing
at both compile-time and run-time.
The performance benefit is often uncertain
and not easily if at all measured on interactive programs.
Therefore, support for link time optimization is disabled.

Oh, that said clang is not a drop in replacement for gcc
and will only be used in preference of gcc for software projects
that require clang for compilation.
All sub-projects involving clang are discontinued.

Security is a benefit and is important.
I can completely escape from
a chroot and unshared name spaces
by executing 2 commands with a EUID = 0 shell.
Anyone who knows the lore can.
Therefore, I allocated effort to repairing
immune-security-tomoyo.

The original implementation of immune-security-tomoyo
provided 5 benefits.
First, tomoyo could provide a write barrier
for the system areas of the file system during compilation.
Second, or tomoyo could be used to observe compilation
and report all the software involved in compilation
which was useful writing requirement lists.
The first two benefits were mutually exclusive.
The third benefit was to provide a write barrier
for system areas of the file system
that prevent modification even by EUID 0 processes
unless authenticating to switch into the freedom domain.
Forth, a user domain was provided to grant login users
with write access to user owned areas.
Fifth, a limited domain was provided to grant limited
write permission to areas of the file system used by services.
Yes, it was originally awesome.

However, the transition from compilation on /usr/src/
to /aux/run/source/ broke the barrier during compilation.
I was never using tomoyo this way so I failed to notice.
For about half a year I was using tomoyo
to help write requirement lists.

The transition to multi-root file systems broke
all aspects of the tomoyo implementation.

I should have fixed it; I was intended to fix it;
but someone was saying that security beyond
what Linux provides by default is unimportant.
Therefore, my attention was constantly diverting.
After seeing how easily I can escape from a chroot
and unshared namespace I completely DISAGREE!
Tomoyo is essential for closing that hole
otherwise the compromise of one realfs
may allow compromise of all realfs.

The current tomoyo implementation can proide domains:
freedom; limited; moil; /sbin/init; user.
The moil domain is for compiling software
while denying it ability to modify system owned areas
of the file system.

The one aspect I did not fix was the ability to use tomoyo
to record files accessed during compilation.
This utilization of tomoyo requires the ability
for policies to be loaded/modified
from within a realfs such as /+/base/ or /+/work/

The ability to load/modify policies grants
a EUID 0 interloper the possibility of defeating tomoyo
by loading a policy.
In theory of execution of the policy loading program
is not permitted by the rules for a tomoyo domain
then loading/modifying policy should be impossible.
Still at least one domain would be able.
If a bug could be exploited to transition domains
then better if the kernel refuses modification from:
/+/*/sbin/tomoyo-{edit,load}policy

If I omitted mentioning changes sorry about that.
More changes are pending.
Certain concessions are no longer compulsory.
Ah, I just remembered something I forgot to mention above.

I do software development on separate realfs.
Everyone should.
Why would a software developer not want
to create a realfs merely for development
and have all the installed software compiled
without optimization and with debugging information?
If enabled then the &quot;debug&quot; feature
disables automatic optimization
and instead adds tor CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS
the content of $DFLAGS
DFLAGS can be set by
# au dflags &quot;-g -O0&quot;
for example.
hyphen gee space hypen oh zero is the default for DFLAGS

The main drawback to debug information
is that it makes executable files and libraries larger.
They use more memory and therefore execute slower,
because of additional page faults,
and perhaps additional jmp statements.

The cpref system is deprecated and removed.
I have not used cpref code
since I coded automatic optimization.
I forgot how many years since I last used cpref.

So why did I disable cpref?
The average performance difference
between -O0 and ( -O2 or -O3 or -Os )
is approximately 5%
The single most important factor
for run time performance is the skill of the programmer.
The next most important factor is computer hardware.
The next most important factor is proper BIOS/CMOS configuration.
The next most important factor is Linux,
because Linux has superior VMM.
The next most important factor is locales,
because almost anything runs faster in the C locale.
And if the program is graphic intensive
then the graphics hardware effects performance.
Configuration of programs to make better use of SMP
can also improve the performance of the programs.

Compiler optimization is so far down the list of factors
that it is unworthy of a SA's consideration.
However, neophyte SAs are fascinated by compiler optimization.
They select the most dangerous and unsafe optimizations.
Then installed software segmentation faults.
Finally, they flame me for their own unrealized culpability.
That ends now and forever.

So to explain that last change succinctly.
Enable the &quot;optimize&quot; or the &quot;debug&quot; feature if desired.
&quot;debug&quot; is dominant if enabled.
If neither &quot;debug&quot; nor &quot;optimize&quot; is enabled
then the optimization flag will be -O0
or hyphen oh zero.
-O0 means compile quick.
And by far -O0 is the best optimization.
But do not believe me.
Compile and test 1000 software projects
with and without optimization and see.

Oh, I nearly forgot.
I removed the init-scripts for gdm kdm and xdm.
Several reasons were involved in that decision.
gdm kdm and xdm are not disallowed.
SAs must assume full responsibility if using them.
When logging in at a virtual console;
I press alt shift a getty;
use arrow keys select a root file system and press space to enter it;
enter user name;
enter pass word;
press space to launch enlightenment.

I have no intention of writing a DirectFB nor wayland
graphical user interface getty
that runs from rootfs and displays aesthetically pleasing
yet entirely useless graphics while
allowing a person to select a realfs and enter credentials.

The problem with GUI logins are:
no choice of realfs is provided;
multiple realfs GUI logins may launch
on different virtual consoles which a neophyte
might not know how to switch to and view;
a GUI for selecting realfs must run on rootfs
and a GUI on the rootfs would increase greatly
increase the memory consumed by rootfs
and the size of the initrf.

So yes there is a choice.
If wanting to have a GUI login launch
then BYOIS, bring yer own init script.
And anyone who wants optimization -O666 can go to...
well, we know the expression already.  :)
