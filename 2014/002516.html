<PRE>Perhaps I forgot to mention this
when I made the change;
however automatic optimization works differently.
First, the optimize feature must be enabled
otherwise optimization is -O0
which is hyphen Oh Zero.
Second, optimization is -O0
when installing software that is not installed.
That expedites deployment.
Finally, -O2 optimization is used when
the optimize feature is enabled
and when a technic has the optimize trait
and when the software project provided
by the technic is already installed.
Or more simply stated only installed software projects
are eligible for the slower compilation that provides optimization.

These changes are not undesirable.
Initial deployment is faster.
Installed software might execute faster following updates.
New computers almost always feel plenty fast, correct?
Yet with these changes they will seem to become faster
over time instead of slower, but only to a point.
Optimized code may required 200% to 300% duration to compile.
However, runtime performance increase is in the 0% to 50% range.
And only software that runs a processor full bore
for a full second or longer
realizes any benefit for being optimized.

The processor utilization by ld.so to dynamically link
ELF executable files during runtime before the program begins execution
can often exceed the processor utilization of many programs
that complete in an instant.
So for example, the difference in execution speed of
-O2 optimized /bin/ls and -O0 optimized /bin/ls
makes no difference unless intending to run /bin/ls 3000 times
in a loop.
And then making /bin/ls a static link executable
improve performance much more so than compiler optimization.

Consequently, for many software projects,
dare I say the majority of software projects,
compiler optimization provides little benefit while
increasing compilation duration by 200% to 300%.
Support libraries such as libz MesaLib, video and audio codecs,
any many other processor intensive libraries tend to be the exception.
And in contrast the fancy GUI interfaces to utilize the libraries
receive practically no benefit from optimization
because the majority of intense processor utilization
is delegated to a support library such as a video codec or libz.

Please forgive if I seem to be belittling SAs.
However, I have come to the impression that many SAs
do not come to realize the significance of optimization
until perhaps a decade of use using a POSIX.
Neophytes read about optimization and tend to think,
&quot;I want everything compiled with -O3 and unsafe optimizations.&quot;
And then they lament when installed software segmentation faults.
And they blame the instability on Kyle's crappy POSIX
when in fact the SA's choice of optimization was culpable.

Moderately experienced SAs might prefer -O2 optimization
for all compiled and installed software projects.
Yes, it creates stable software.
However, it also doubles if not triples deployment and update duration
They yet lack the realization that the benefit of optimization
becomes evident only where processing cycles are spent.

As a result of that a few years ago I deprecated the concept
of a default cpref file in favor of granting the optimization
only to software projects that have the capacity
to utilize a processor for a significant duration.
That way the benefit of optimization can be realized
without paying the cost for optimizing all installed software.

With that consideration the method for providing optimization
continues to evolve.
And those who prefer to simply omit optimization,
because a computer is plenty fast already,
can disable the optimize feature
which will minimize the duration for updates.

As always the speed at which code accomplish a task
is not effected most by the computer upon which it runs,
nor the compiler which compiled it, nor the compiler optimization.
Whether code accomplish a task quickly
depends entirely upon the skill of the software author.
And that is a factor that tends to be beyond the control
of both SAs and POSX integrators.
