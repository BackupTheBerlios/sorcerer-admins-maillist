<PRE>AI think I have enough clues. Now I just need to sOlve it. I just want
Sorcerer to be my server distro eventually and so I can be a Sorcerer
Server Admin.
Thank you.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Doesn't work. That was the first thing I tried.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Evert was correct that detailed report including exact error message and
</I>&gt;<i> logs
</I>&gt;<i> are required when further assistance is desired.
</I>&gt;<i> That is because many command problems that can be anticipated
</I>&gt;<i> are already circumvented with Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> startx failing would likely be a box specific error rather than a
</I>&gt;<i> distribution wide problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, such a problem must be solved at the box specific level
</I>&gt;<i> based upon the SA's knowledge, skill, and any 3rd party assistance
</I>&gt;<i> that can be acquired
</I>&gt;<i> from email lists, forums, news groups, FAQs, HowTOs, manual pages,
</I>&gt;<i> google searches, etc...
</I>&gt;<i> Since the log files usually contain either excellent clues or the exact
</I>&gt;<i> reason
</I>&gt;<i> then those are the place to start.
</I>&gt;<i> Almost any SA who has been using X11 long enough
</I>&gt;<i> has experienced a moment when the X server would not start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I need to learn everything about Sorcerer before learning bigger
</I>&gt;<i> projects like wayland.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ambitious.  Even I do not know everything about the software that is
</I>&gt;<i> installed by Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> However, some areas I have more specialization and skill with than others.
</I>&gt;<i> If becoming involved with wayland development
</I>&gt;<i> then understanding how X works and it's protocol could be useful.
</I>&gt;<i> Having experiencing writing X apps might also be useful.
</I>&gt;<i> However, that all might also be unnecessary.
</I>&gt;<i> Best way to discover is by asking the people already involved with
</I>&gt;<i> wayland development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, if I was a new programmer wanting to assist with open source
</I>&gt;<i> development
</I>&gt;<i> then I might want to become involved with the coreutils developers.
</I>&gt;<i> coreutils is a collection of relatively small and simple utilities
</I>&gt;<i> used by shell scripts
</I>&gt;<i> and SAs when at a command line.
</I>&gt;<i> In some cases coreutils provides functionality such as sort and uniq.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet other programs such as rm rmdir mkdir
</I>&gt;<i> act as sophisticated wrappers for glibc file system functions.
</I>&gt;<i> They allow the shell to perform those commands.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over a decade ago someone showed me something called an OSI chart
</I>&gt;<i> that explained an operating system as 7 layers.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model</A>
</I>&gt;<i> This is conceptually useful for neophytes that do not yet recognize
</I>&gt;<i> the interconnectedness.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the model is not useful for veterans that see and realize the
</I>&gt;<i> connections.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The majority of software acts as units that partially process and
</I>&gt;<i> translate information for a separate layer.
</I>&gt;<i> For example wayland can act as a layer that sits between the X server
</I>&gt;<i> and the kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> And in general the processing that wayland does makes X output slower
</I>&gt;<i> than allowing X to communicate directly with the kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> And the kernel provides and controls access to hardware.
</I>&gt;<i> Not everyone would agree, but programming tends to become easier
</I>&gt;<i> the further removed it is from interacting with hardware.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> kernel &lt;-&gt; glibc &lt;-&gt; coreutils &lt;-&gt; bash
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is where coreutils is situated.
</I>&gt;<i> And if the aforementioned hypothesis is true
</I>&gt;<i> then kernel hacking is very challenging,
</I>&gt;<i> glibc hacking is moderately challenging,
</I>&gt;<i> coreutils programming is an average challenge,
</I>&gt;<i> and bash programming is easy.
</I>&gt;<i> However, exceptions to every rule exist.
</I>&gt;<i> In my experience shell programming is very different
</I>&gt;<i> than assembly, C, C++, Pascal, perl, PHP, Fortran, etc...
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, mastery of shell programming is not easily acquired.
</I>&gt;<i> And master does not mean that one is capable of writing shell scripts,
</I>&gt;<i> but rather that the shell scripts created run incredibly fast.
</I>&gt;<i> It is the main reason why most people except that shell programs
</I>&gt;<i> will run extremely slow when compared to an implementation in any
</I>&gt;<i> other language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If accepting the OSI model as gospel truth
</I>&gt;<i> then reconciling linux becomes difficult
</I>&gt;<i> since it exists at multiple layers.
</I>&gt;<i> However, choosing participation at an easy level in order to gain
</I>&gt;<i> experience
</I>&gt;<i> can be more useful than diving into the deep end with a &quot;sink or swim
</I>&gt;<i> attitude.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm looking into game development as a degree and then I would need to
</I>&gt;<i> learn
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more about server administration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seems like it could be even more lucrative than running an online casino.
</I>&gt;<i> People seem very happy to exchange real money for virtual items.
</I>&gt;<i> The house always wins with online gaming.
</I>&gt;<i> However, that might be a big corporation that fleeces both the
</I>&gt;<i> customers and the workers.
</I>&gt;<i> The pay might not be commensurate with the amount of learning and
</I>&gt;<i> training required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for telling me more about wayland.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The benefit of experience allows for a different interpretation of
</I>&gt;<i> what was written at the homepage.
</I>&gt;<i> I can see how the goals are to make it a software layer
</I>&gt;<i> that will not necessarily replace X
</I>&gt;<i> at least not in the near future.
</I>&gt;<i> However, what begins as something that is potentially superfluous
</I>&gt;<i> can evolve into something that becomes an essential component such as udev.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer's existence pre-dates the udev project,
</I>&gt;<i> and Sorcerer might have been one of the first projects to use devfs
</I>&gt;<i> instead of a traditional /dev on disk file system.
</I>&gt;<i> However, in these days few people might want to run a box without the
</I>&gt;<i> benefit of udev.
</I>&gt;<i> I would go as far as to say that
</I>&gt;<i> I perceive udev as being a near essential utility for using a modular
</I>&gt;<i> kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> The evolution of the udev project slowly eroded my resistance towards
</I>&gt;<i> modular kernels.
</I>&gt;<i> For many of Sorcerer's earlier years; Sorcerer was a distribution
</I>&gt;<i> intended to be run
</I>&gt;<i> with a monolithic kernel and to boot without initramfs images.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, my point is that wayland might have a bright future
</I>&gt;<i> or it might become something like DirectFB.
</I>&gt;<i> Retrospect is required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I need to learn to be a hard core
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorcerer Admin and also cast works.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I casted enlightenment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> cast is among the odd English words that lack a separate conjugation
</I>&gt;<i> for past tense.
</I>&gt;<i> To say &quot;I cast enlightenment.&quot; is interpreted as an action that
</I>&gt;<i> already happened.
</I>&gt;<i> Although conjugation of Nihongo verbs work only 3 ways
</I>&gt;<i> I tend to also find myself doing google searches
</I>&gt;<i> in order to gain absolute certainty.
</I>&gt;<i> Please feel no shame for learning that cast has no separate form for
</I>&gt;<i> past tense conjugation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer is much like any other distribution but with fewer fluffy GUI
</I>&gt;<i> configuration tools.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, SAs must read the documentation
</I>&gt;<i> such as manual pages and the files provided in /usr/share/tldp/
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/doc/ /usr/share/doc/ /usr/src/linux/Documentation/
</I>&gt;<i> also contain fascinating reading.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps the challenge is not acquiring the information
</I>&gt;<i> but narrowing the searching and learning to immediately relevant
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, I just now noticed
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/src/linux/tldp/XFree86-Second-Mouse
</I>&gt;<i> Never considered the possibility previously,
</I>&gt;<i> but hmm I have unopened mice boxes in my hardware reserve.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> What could I do with two mice?
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps I rather attach a tablet device, for drawing?
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, with all that documentation; becoming distracted is easy.
</I>&gt;<i> Almost nobody will read all of it.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone who tries will probably gain a spinning headache
</I>&gt;<i> and spend a few hours comatose.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OUYA is coming out in March 2013. It will be using Android OS and will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; completely hackable. Gaming will soon evolve for Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some people will probably enjoy being able to program their own phones
</I>&gt;<i> and mobile devices.
</I>&gt;<i> And access to free software should be completely better than an app store.
</I>&gt;<i> If I ever decided to buy one of those mobile gadgets
</I>&gt;<i> then I might also create a Sorcerer port for it
</I>&gt;<i> provided that the device has sufficient RAM and mass storage.
</I>&gt;<i> If it has embedded limitations then I will forget about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Being able to run open source voice over IP telephone programs on a
</I>&gt;<i> mobile cell phone
</I>&gt;<i> might not only be desirable for the advantage of being able to
</I>&gt;<i> voice/video conference,
</I>&gt;<i> but also for what it could save on international long distance calls
</I>&gt;<i> to cell phone.
</I>&gt;<i> Only because my sister insisted; I tried skype on linux.
</I>&gt;<i> Both the ELF and statically linked versions of skype segmentation
</I>&gt;<i> fault and crash.
</I>&gt;<i> They were both entirely unusable.
</I>&gt;<i> I am not a fan of voice over IP using proprietary protocols.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can tell you more later. I need to figure out X now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The manual pages and the documentation provided by the linux
</I>&gt;<i> documentation project
</I>&gt;<i> would be the first place that I would start looking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Oh and a forum would be good for Sorcerer Linux so that the same issues
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; won't be brought up again. It is also easier for newbies and has better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communication that can easily be referenced if messaged before.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, Sorcerer probably has a wiki and forum somewhere.
</I>&gt;<i> I seem to remember that a forum exists at the berlios project page,
</I>&gt;<i> but I do not actually look at it.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps I am too lazy?
</I>&gt;<i> Email lists seem more convenient than forums.
</I>&gt;<i> And the fast bug fixes introduced into Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> quickly renders distribution wide problems ancient history.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A problem involving startx would instead be a box specific problem.
</I>&gt;<i> The reason would typically involve something that the SA did or did not do
</I>&gt;<i> such as failure to read the manual page and create the proper
</I>&gt;<i> files in one's home directory with proper mode and content.
</I>&gt;<i> startx might have worked fine and then immediately exited
</I>&gt;<i> because X had no reason to remain running.
</I>&gt;<i> I apologize if the response seems harsh,
</I>&gt;<i> but based upon receiving no error message and no logs;
</I>&gt;<i> then I would surmise that startx worked perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> and the account running startx lacked the user created files
</I>&gt;<i> in the home directory that would cause a window manager
</I>&gt;<i> and other fun programs to run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I knew someone with a near eidetic memory..
</I>&gt;<i> Of course he read every document a minimum of 8 times.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I have no hesitation about re-reading documentation
</I>&gt;<i> when something I try achieves an undesired outcome.
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck on the next try.  :)
