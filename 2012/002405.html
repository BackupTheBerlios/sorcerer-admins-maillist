<PRE>sorcery delegate was rather fancy was it not?
For those that missed the update, about 10 queues and 8 utilities control
the action.
That way a combination of limiting which processes run concurerntly
cgroup cpu.shares per utility, and cock rate limiting I/O
all combined effort to achieve a more optimal use of resources
while limiting the potential for causing lag in user owned processes.
Being able to do updates without downtime has always been an important goal
of Sorcerer.
That is why boxes do not goto runlevel 1 and kick all users during updates
which was traditional of pre-compiled binary based distros.

However, not long ago a user rebuked me because firefox would not start.
The box was in the middle of an update.
Normally, this type of problem would not happen.
It could have been due to a bug in sorcery.
But I did not have the moment to investigate and identify the exact cause
of it.
Instead I thought, &quot;A design change in sorcery could preclude the
possibility
of disruption of services during updates.&quot;
And so I have created that sorcery.
It is called sorcery paradigm.

Paradigm is a fancy word that literally means point of view.
Some people would say that a paradigm is a model
that effects how one perceives.
Again that is merely a point of view.
In a more simple sense,
sorcery paradigm is a sorcery with explicit chrooting capabilities.

Paradigms are hard link copies of a portion of the root file system.
Paradigm functionality is not enabled by default.
The feature &quot;paradigm&quot; must be enabled.
And the &quot;shift&quot; feature allows for automatic paradigm shifting
as opposed to explicitly running
# augur paradigm /para/new shift
to shift to the newer paradigm.

As suggested at the end of the above paragraph
the new paradigm is created within /para/new/
Casting spells, dispelling spells are actions that happen
within the new paradigm when the paradigm feature is enabled.
Therefore, a request to dispel yelp
would have no effect upon /
but instead dispel yelp within /para/new/
When all the requested changes such as
updating and dispelling installed software complete
then /para/new/ represents the new state of the box.
/para/new/ can become the current state of the box
by explicitly running
# augur paradigm /para/new shift

So what happens to / during a shift?

If /para/old/$YEAR$MONTH/ does not exist
then the content of / receives hard links in /para/old/$YEAR$MONTH/
That becomes a reference point.
As many as 4 old reference points are kept.
Therefore, a box could be shifted backwards
up to a quarter of a year if the box updates
monthly or weekly.
Shifting backwards should also allow the regression
to a previously installed version of glibc
which is a functionality that can not currently be achieved
by using archives as they are currently implemented.

Anyone still following might be wondering if paradigm support
requires a considerable amount of additional disk space.
The additional requirement is slight.
Paradigm support consumes mostly inodes.
Fortunately, most file systems have nearly
a magnitude more inodes than are being used.

A file on disk will have only one inode.
However, that inode may have more than one link.
An inode does not revert to free space
until after all links to it are removed
and it is no longer an open file.
So the way that paradigm functionality is achieved
is not by copying files nor by copying disk content,
but instead by adjusting links to inodes.

An additional requirement for paradigm support is that
/usr must exist on / and not be a separate file system.
A far more complicated implementation
with an increased probability for bugs
would be required if trying to avoid the possibility
of creating cross file system linked files.

Paradigm support is not intended to be a substitute for backups.
However, a file deleted within /
might yet retain a link to it somewhere within /para/old/
Paradigm support is not intended to be a substitute
for a dedicated development box for testing changes.
However, a paradigm enabled box could revert from an update
in a matter of minutes or seconds
without requiring backups nor archives.

Because innodes are a limited commodity
paradigm support is being limited to 4 old references.
Depleting all available inodes would be detrimental.

# stat -f /bin/bash | grep Inodes:

will display total and available inodes.
If the amount in use is more than 1/5th the total
then perhaps the file system has too few inodes
for paradigm functionality.

Succinctly stated, paradigm support
is as if the sorcery utilities ran chrooted within /para/new/

Of course please read
# au help paradigm

to explain the actual usage of the module
after the feature is enabled.

Lastly, for those who fear hard links...
Both the mode, ownership and extended attributes of hard linked files
remain identical for all links to an inode.
Therefore, a file readable only by root in one location
will not necessarily by readable by everyone somewhere else.
However, directories are never hard linked.
/para/{old,new}/ are owned by root and mode 700
That wards away curious users.
Consequently, paradigm support is expected
to have no effect upon security.

The only way a paradigm enabled box is less secure
is if the &quot;shift&quot; feature is not enabled
and the SA forgets to shift to the new paradigm.
In that case all updates are confined to /para/new/
and not shifted to /
Consequently, consider carefully whether the &quot;shift&quot; feature
should also be enabled.

For the moment paradigm support represents functionality
that may be more appealing for some SAs than others.
Similarly, SAs opinions also vary concerning the benefit of archives.
However, paradigm support might be a better fit for a source
based distribution than archives of previously installed software.

Archives are not intended to be a substitute for the packages
that pre-compiled binary package managers create.
That is because archives contain no information
about which ELF shared libraries are required.
And sorcery does not append a spell or distribution specific
version number to indicate which modification of a spell
was used to create the archive.

The reference points created by paradigm support
achieve the state of functionality that was current at that point in time.
Therefore, if software after updates segfaults or has annoying runtime bugs
then the same software from a reference point created a month before
would run as it did a month before.

In the above scenario a reference point is more desirable than an archive.
The runtime bugs evident in a program might not be present in the program.
For example a runtime bug in firefox, which frequently updates,
might not be a bug in firefox.
The bug might exist in a separate ELF library used by firefox such as zlib.
Such a problem has occurred in the past with zlib and with other libraries.
Hunting such a bug using reference points
could be easier than hunting it using archives.

The interdependency of software makes the examination of archives
tantamount to looking at one pixel on a display individually.
In contrast examining and comparing reference points is like
looking all the pixels on a display and gives &quot;the big picture.&quot;

Paradigm support is not unlike gaining a small portion of the benefit
of having / in a git repository or the ability to revert a BTRFS to a
previous state.
However, sorcery does not require git nor BTRFS for paradigm support.
It only requires a significant amount of inodes.
And the amount of inodes provided on a file system
can be set at the file system creation time.

The future of sorcery and Sorcerer
seems likely to involve the improvement of paradigm support
and diminished support for archives.
