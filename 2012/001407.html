<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>the menu driven installer will know what partitions
to offer for possible initialization and also what filesystem
to create if the partition is to be initialized.
To be specific the word initialization in this context
means to create a filesystem.

Finally, now that there is a root filesystem
then the mount menu can be visited and
the root filesystem will be mounted as /media/root
After that is successful
then the install menu can be visited.
The menu driven installer will now quickly copy files
to the real root filesystem and extract them.
In qemu this step requires some time.
But on real hardware it is considerably fast.
Still there should be enough time to refill one's
orange juice glass and look for a rainbow outside.

After files are installed
there is merely one more step in order for it to become bootable.
Visit the compile menu.
This one will present many menus that ask questions.
At least selecting default locales will expedite compilation,
because creating a complete set of locales is time consuming
and also wastes about 30M or more megabytes of disk space.
The etc spell can be recast later for the convenience
of being reminded which files in /etc the SA should edit.

After compilation is complete
then the box is ready to reboot.
After booting from fixed disk,
naturally, set a root password,
give the box a name,
set the system and hardware clock date/time,
and finally configure the network by reading files
in /etc/networks.d/ and copying and modifying a template
that describes the network type.
Or if you are feeling lazy and have a DHCP server
then type something like
dhcpcd eth0
to obtain an instant IP address for the eth0 device.
Network configuration is the most manual aspect of
installing a Sorcerer box.

Now that is all done the Sorcerer box is ready
for updating and deploying with the software
required for mission critical operation.
I recommend that this be done in 2 steps.
First, update the box.
# augur easy

Software changes so quickly that half the software
on installed by an I/R is already obsolete by the time
that you receive it.
So having about 100 spells recast is not atypical.

Now that is done the exact mission critical spells to
install on the box can be selected using sorcery or
instead issued as command line parameters to cast.
Figuring out what to installs, if doing it by command line,
is best done with some assistance from augur.
The augur utility has some useful commands for searching
the catalog of available software by keyword, category, attribute.

Sorcerer's catalog of software, also called a grimoire,
has about 3000+ entries in it.
Yes, that does not seem like much compared to a
pre-compiled binary based distro,
but that is because Sorcerer does not chop sources
into -dev packages, -lib packages, -exe packages,
nor does it chop something like coreutils into a bazillaion
smaller package for each of the utilities installed.
With Sorcerer, entire sources are compiled and installed.
Each Sorcerer box can be used for software development.
So what would seem like 12000 or more packages in
a pre-compiled binary based distro only amounts to about
3000 spells in Sorcerer.
In my opinion having fewer spells is less of a brain strain
on SAs for selecting software to install,
yet at the same time receiving much of the same high
quality software provided by other distros.

Installing something like kde-v4 is very simple.
cast kde-v4
gnome is equally simple.
cast gnome

After the optional and switch menus are visited during cast
the rest of the process involving the downloading,
compilation, and installation of software is automatic
and happens in the background at nice 15.
There is no need to wait upon it.
Also additional software can be selected for casting
and added to the cast queue.
sorcery will install the software in the proper order,
and often use multiple CPU cores to compile software
concurrently for faster installation.
This behavior can be set using the CAST_RATE variable
which can be set somewhere under one of sorcery's
configuration menu when the sorcery tool is invoked.

Installing kde-v4 or kde-v3 requires a long time to completion.
However, most other software,
excluding linux-modular and firefox,
installs very fast on box.
The process of waiting for software to install might require
between 30 minutes or several hours depending upon the
load that the SA requested.
This is referred to as the &quot;big wait&quot;
During this time logging out is fine,
just leave the computer on and connected to a network
so that it can complete installation of software.
Since this time is entirely non-interactive
it requires no SA attention.

The &quot;big wait&quot; both that happens during the final deployment
of sorcerer and when updating sorcerer boxes
is the one significant drawback
that is common to source based distros.
Having software compiled for optimal performance
actually requires some time to compile it.

However, the &quot;big wait&quot; is not a big factor in the long run.
During updates a box does not have to be reduced to runlevel 1.
Boxes can be updated while users are logged in
and while services are being provided.
Services will restart as necessary to start running the
newer software once the newer software is installed.
And because updating happens in the background at nice 15
a box is still available for hard work, or watching videos,
or even playing video games while it is updating.
The high nice value tells the kernel to provide cast with
CPU cycles that would otherwise be idle or wasted.
So if nothing heavy is running on the box,
besides the casting of spells,
then updates will happen quickly.
If updating while watching video
then the update will require a bit longer to complete
than if nearly all CPU cycles could be granted to cast.

Please keep in mind that sometime during an update of
gnome or kde-v3 or kde-v4 that the GUI login manager
will be restarted which will probably abruptly end the X
session of any user that is logged in during that time.
Sorry about that.
Hiding the pid for kdm or gdm which is normally in
/var/run/ within a subdirectory called hide
will normally keep those from restarting.

Other ways to avoid inconveniencing users is to schedule
updates by cronjobs that happen during night hours.
At many workplaces workstations are left on during night
and idle the CPU for nearly 14 hours.
Those are awesome times for updating.

Now for the final recommendation.
Each Sorcerer box is unique because it can have a load out
of software on it that might not exist anywhere else.
Consequently, very rarely a problem will occur on a box
that has a very specific load out of software.
And that problem might not occur on my test box during testing.
So I could be unaware of it.
There was a problem like that a long time ago where
maybe db failed to compile if emacs was installed.
Or it was something like that where something failed to compile
because something else was installed.
Consequently, better to stay ahead of breakage
than to have it bust down upon your head.
The way to stay ahead of breaks is to have a box
deployed that is merely for testing, called the &quot;dev&quot; box.
Update the dev box before updating any production boxes.
That way if a problem could happen on the production boxes
then it will first happen on the dev box.

If both the dev box and production boxes are on automatic updates
then the dev box can be given a LAG=3D0 while the production boxes
are given LAG=3D7 in order to create a week's worth of separation.
This way problems will occur on the dev box a week ahead
of when they would occur on the production box.
That gives a SA time to spot a problem and interdict before
it becomes a problem on a production box.

However, using high LAG values on production boxes means
that software updates for both bug fixes and security problems
will occur that much slower than when they become available
in the LAG=3D0 grimoire.
Alas, there is no perfect solution for this.
By default Sorcerer boxes have LAG=3D1
which is useful if the SA was able to set the
date/time for the box, but was unable to do so
so that the box knows what the correct UTC date/time is.
That could happen for example if the box is dual booted
with a windoze operating system that stores date internally
in localtime instead of UTC time.

Probably, after having one or two
successful installations of Sorcerer
then using the menu driven installer
will seem less of an ordeal.
At the moment the menu driven installer
merely simplifies the steps of installation
by invoking required commands with proper parameters.
This is helpful since a SA would not actually have to know
the name of the utility for creating a filesystem or the
parameters to pass to it.
However, the steps involved in installation are not strictly
enforced by the menu driven installer.
Therefore, the SA must be aware of the general path
that one must travel in order to install a POSIX.

After mastering the menu driven installer
perhaps try attempting a manual install that does not
involve using the menu driven installer.
Yes, it is possible.
And doing so will gain confidence in one's knowledge
of how the pieces of a POSIX fit together.

Compared to what used to by required in order to manually
install Debian more than a decade ago, Sorcerer is a bit
more difficult to manually install.
But it involves creating a partition, a filesystem, copying files,
unarchiving tarballs, editing lilo.conf.head
and then running many of the scripts in
/etc/init.d/ in order to handle the tedious things like
generating the sysvinit /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/* symbolic links,
creating the initramfs, installing lilo, etc...

Sorcerer is actually even a bit gentle to the SA that
tries to do a manual install assuming the attempt is
nearly perfect.
For example if a root partition is not specified in /etc/fstab
then there is a menu that appears during sysinit that allows
the SA to specify which partition to mount as the root partition.
But even so, eventually /etc/fstab should be properly edited
to include a root partition.
But not having it that way will not block a box from booting
if the SA is willing to assist.

Another method might be to try to do the manual install,
then fail to be able to boot the box,
so then boot using the I/R
and select the fixed disk partition for the root filesystem.
Now it is loaded, but not yet complete.
Check /etc/lilo.conf.head and /etc/fstab and make corrections.
Now run /etc/init.d/rc.d.
Finally, shutdown -r
At this point the shutdown scripts will run that will do the
necessary things like creating an initramfs and installing lilo and such.
And if it is sufficient then the box will be bootable from fixed disk.

The menu driven installer is a big help to SAs
for being able to install a box quickly for very little SA attention.
Basically, just by pressing arrow keys, space and enter
and pressing / at one point
is all that is required to go through the menu driven installer
after invoking it with sinstall.  :)

That said, however you want to install Sorcerer is
properly the correct method as long as it is bootable
after installation.  :)
After creating one Sorcerer box you might want to
create a chrooted install to use as a template for new boxes.
That way new boxes can be installed by booting from an I/R,
creating a filesytem, starting the network,
scping a compressed tarball,
and then uncompressing it.
Other SAs might temporarily install a disk in a removable drive bay
and then hot plug it into a Sorcerer box and then do the installation
to the removable from the already deployed box.
By this method installing without an CD drive is possible.

Rumor has it that a USB memory drive can be ruined by
dding a bootable CD image, such as Sorcerer's I/R,
to the USB memory drive's device.
According to rumor the USB memory drive then acts as
if it is a bootable detachable CD device.
But once written that way the change can not be undone.
But $10 or less for a USB thumb drive is cheaper
than buying an optical disk drive and also tends to
be faster than installing from CD.
Also most computers created during 2004 or later
are capable of booting from a USB device.
Groovy.  :)

My advice is to keep trying with the installation.
One a person's understanding of the steps required
for installation is complete
then there is practically no way to mess it up.
Failure to achieve an installed Sorcerer box
while using the menu driven installer is usually
due to a SA skipping an important step.
Therefore, be careful.
If a menu is marked as optional,
but you might be uncertain about what it does
then visit that menu and see what it says.

Yes, initializing a filesystem is optional if an
initialized filesystem already exists.
But if it does not already exist
then that menu is not optional.  :)
Maybe that is strange logic for the use
of the word optional.
But the word optional does mean that in some cases
where the SA has already done that step previously
then installation is possible without visiting an optional menu.
For example, when installing Sorcerer on a disk while overwriting
some other operating system then the disk is already partitioned
and therefore visiting the partitioning menu is optional.
However, in order to re-use a partition
then the filesystem initialization menu should be visited
in order to create a new empty filesystem on an existing partition.

After some consideration I am guessing that the use of
the word &quot;optional&quot; is confusing in the context of the menu
driven installer, because the SA must know why a menu
is optional in order to determine if the menu should be visited.

I must consider this in detail to determine how to help SAs
make better choices about skipping optional menus.
I can not simply force SAs to initialize every partition that
is specified in in the fstab menu,
because that could lead to unwanted data loss.
So, maybe I can give SAs some second chance
at skipped optional menus without forcing them
to do them?

Obviously, the in this respect the menu driven installer
is not buggy, but for SAs very new to Sorcerer
the use of the word &quot;optional&quot; is confusing
and perhaps misleading?

Creating a menu driven installer that is lose enough
for senior level SAs to make it do what they want,
yet tight enough to keep new SAs from falling through
the cracks is difficult.
Ultimately, the menu driven installer should be an experience
that is survivable without the use of external documentation
in order to properly navigate the menus.
The use of Sorcerer should be a positive successful
hands-on experience where there is no reading 300 pages
of documentation before unwrapping the CD.
Obviously, the menu driven installer is not there yet.
But you will probably enjoy augur's help,
both the help menu and
the verbose help available on each augur parameter.
