RecordMyDesktop is good. I also use RecordItNow, and the two available
frontends for RecordMyDeskTop are:

1.) qt-recordmydesktop

and,

2.) gtk-recordmydesktop

RecordItNow is really just a front end (iow, requires, as deps)
recordmydesktop AND ffmpeg.

ffmpeg is pretty much the standard, and so the user should be familar
with that app, join the appropriate support list, have enough memory,
know which codecs, frame rates, screen size, and whether they want to
simultaneously record audio, etc.

Since ffmpeg is a command line app, a few simple variations of a two
line shell script will suffice to begin using it.

There are dozens of audio and video libraries, and the user needs to
know what it is that they need to have compiled on the system before
compiling and installing ffmpeg [and if they choose, RecordItNow along
with the other dependency, recordmydesktop), or they might think that it
doesn't work when it actually does.

ffmpeg includes libavcodec, but depending on exactly the user wants to
be able to do with regards to recording and playing audio/video, they
might probably also want to include several optional (and most of them
not autodected) dependencies such as:

celt
libdc1394
dirac
faac (creates non-redistributable binary)
frei0r
gsm
openjpeg
lame
opencv
opencore-amr
rtmpdump
schroedinger
speex
libvpx
x264
xvidcore

Each of the above may in turn have their own set of deps that needs to
be installed as well. Truly, the user will want to have about half of
those optional deps above, yet I install and compile in support for all
of them into ffmpeg - which before anything else (IMNSHO) should be THE
app for audio and video one has installed on their box.

The folks who asked for this should probably post to the list too so
their requests can be vetted and refined so that you don't have to
engage in any undue guesswork resulting from their not-knowing what it
is that they actually want or need.

On behalf of whomever that was, thanks Kyle :)

I hope that helps!

Kindest regards,
