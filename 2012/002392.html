<PRE>Off list discussion exists concerning performance and control groups.
On list I previously announced my dissatisfaction
with the cgroup blkio subsystem and CFQ scheduler.
As a result I modified the cgroup init-script to mount without the
blkio subsystem
and reverted the default I/O scheduler to deadline.
However, this was not the end,
but only the beginning of the changes.

When I announced the &quot;Sorcerer's familiar,&quot;
I might have failed to disclose
that much of the disk I/O done by sorcery was moved.
Input/Output tasks that could be accomplished in advance
are accomplished sooner to avoid waiting for I/O.
I/O tasks that do not require immediate processing are delayed.
The result was a non intuitive spread of I/O
which enables &quot;cast&quot; to spend less time waiting.
However, this also was not the end of changes.

The sorcery tools, arriving concurrently with the KDE 4.9.1 update,
rate limits disk I/O.
This implementation is completely independent
from the blkio.weight from the cgroup blkio subsystem.
Instead, almost any task involving I/O receives a limit
that allows boxes plenty of free I/O for user owned processes,
services, swapping, and basically role uninterrupted performance.
Nearly all potential causes of I/O lag should be circumvented.

Intuitively, rate limiting I/O should cause slower casting, correct?
Indeed rate limiting would be costly
If I had not restructured when I/O happens.
Consequently, rate limiting causes almost no effect
when casting a queue with many spells.
The effect is that I/O is spread more gently
while cast spends less time waiting for I/O.
Sorcerer boxes will be able to obtain smooth performance
during updates even when box lack
a gigabyte or more of RAM allocated to caching.

Another question in the category of limiting resource consumption
might be how to allocate less than maximum processors to sorcery.
If installed RAM is sufficient
than cast will attempt to use all 4 cores on a quad core box.
If installed RAM seems less than sufficient
then cast will reduce processor usage accordingly.
And if the &quot;min&quot; feature is enabled
then cast will attempt to use minimal resources while casting.
However, another method also exists.

All of sorcery runs from sub control groups slow/sorcery

SAs could specify exactly which CPUs to use
by echoing an appropriate value to
/sys/fs/cgroup/slow/sorcery/cpuset.cpus
or
/sys/fs/cgroup/slow/sorcery/cast/cpuset.cpus

Or by invoking

# /etc/init.d/cgroup configure

a change can be made that is loaded during each boot.

Obviously, optimal update speeds are achieved
by efficient utilization of all available processors.
However, if a box is expected to always have
one role specific process running at near full bore
then two configuration changes could be prudent.
First, one processor could be delegated
to running the role specific task.
Again this can be accomplished using cpuset.cpus.
Secondly, sorcery can be assigned utilization
of the processors not being delegated otherwise.
Delegation of processors makes task swapping
more efficient for the linux kernel.

Processes running within the norm and fast hierarchy
of control groups are allowed to load balance.
As described from Section 1.7 in
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/cgroups/cpusets.txt
&quot;If one CPU is underutilized, kernel code running on that CPU
will look for tasks on other more overloaded CPUs
and move those tasks to itself...&quot;

However, processes within the slow and idle hierarchy
do not receive load balancing.
This tends to be a good selection because the kernel
wastes less CPU cycles playing musical chairs with processes and processors
and therefore, a greater amount of L1 and L2 processor cache hits occur.

Consequently, delegating the use of processors 2, 3 and 4 to sorcery
ensures that the cache of the 1st processor is not being utilized by sorcery
and therefore is available to the other processes running on it.

Here is some additional text quoted from the aforementioned document,

&quot;This default load balancing across all CPUs
is not well suited for the following two situations:
 1) On large systems, load balancing across many CPUs is expensive.
    If the system is managed using cpusets to place independent jobs
    on separate sets of CPUs, full load balancing is unnecessary.
 2) Systems supporting realtime on some CPUs need to minimize
    system overhead on those CPUs, including avoiding task load
    balancing if that is not needed.&quot;

Consequently, knowing a bit about when and what to load balance
and what to delegate is useful for large systems with many processors.
And of course in a scenario where
all processors delegated to a task
are expected to be utilized at 100%
or has demand that exceeds processors delegated
then load balancing tends to be undesirable.

Be aware that on CPUs that lack a L3 processor cache
that spans all processing cores
then a process being load balanced to a different processor or core
loses potential cache hits, because the desired memory content
is in the L1 or L2 cache of the processor where the process was
previously running.

Therefore, in general the best performance tends to be achieved when a process
is allowed to remain running on the same processor where it started.
On Sorcerer this is the default for X when X is started by gdm, kdm, and xdm.
X and the gdm/kdm/xdm processes are made to run exclusively on the
first processor.
And that is beneficial.

The three easy methods for selecting where processes run are:
the cpuset.cpus within a control group,
the taskset program,
and $ cgroup affine $PROCESSOR_NUMBER $PARAMETERS_OR_PIDS
Obviously, the third method provides the most convenience for the
least amount of control.
Even after reading the manual page
taskset can be somewhat confusing to invoke.
And if using control groups directly
then reading
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/cgroup/cpusets.txt
provides a sufficient understanding, but it is 37K of reading.

Sorry if that provided too much information.
I do not want anyone to expect
that sorcery resource utilization
is unreasonable or beyond control.

With the aforementioned changes to sorcery;
the sorcery that updates our boxes during 2013
should be nearly transparent.
Even without the &quot;min&quot; feature enabled
primary role performance should not diminish during updates.
