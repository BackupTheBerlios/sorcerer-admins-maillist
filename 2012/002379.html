<PRE>There was no sentient version. I'm somewhat new to the command line but I
have a guide. I have not done much but I'll do as much as I can before
asking for help. I need sleep but I can either get back on this tomorrow
night or Tuesday. Thank you. I don't think I want it to start up with a GUI
but I want to start up enlightenment or KDE someday.

You should look into the Wayland replacement for X11 or Xorg. From what I
hear it will be better but it is just developing.

&gt;<i> The selection of software to start during boot
</I>&gt;<i> is provided in the form of traditional runlevels.
</I>&gt;<i> This is the description from /etc/inittab
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Runlevels
</I>&gt;<i> # 0: halt
</I>&gt;<i> # 1: sequential init
</I>&gt;<i> # 2: parallel   init + multi-user + networking
</I>&gt;<i> # 3: sequential init + multi-user + networking
</I>&gt;<i> # 4: parallel   init + multi-user + networking + GUI login
</I>&gt;<i> # 5: sequential init + multi-user + networking + GUI login
</I>&gt;<i> # 6: reboot
</I>&gt;<i> # 7: initramfs
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On my boxes I use runlevel 3 or runlevel 5.
</I>&gt;<i> They require longer to run, but the scroll is more clean
</I>&gt;<i> and less confusing during runlevel execution.
</I>&gt;<i> However, both 4 and 5 provide the gdm,kdm,xdm GUI login.
</I>&gt;<i> If Sorcerer Sentient is installed
</I>&gt;<i> then kdm will run if the runlevel is set to 5.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer Sentient sets the default runlevel to 4 during installation.
</I>&gt;<i> On the previous I/R I verified that this worked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recommend verifying that the Sorcerer Sentient installation is complete.
</I>&gt;<i> # augur log version sorcerer-sentient
</I>&gt;<i> If it is not installed then a version number will not print.
</I>&gt;<i> In that event execute:
</I>&gt;<i> # augur begin sorcerer-sentient; augur scry
</I>&gt;<i> Then wait until all spells are successfully cast.
</I>&gt;<i> At that point press q to leave the scry.
</I>&gt;<i> Execute
</I>&gt;<i> # pgrep -u root cast
</I>&gt;<i> If not PIDs are printed then cast is not running.
</I>&gt;<i> The box is safe to reboot.
</I>&gt;<i> # shutdown -r now
</I>&gt;<i> That is the proper reboot command.
</I>&gt;<i> Upon reboot KDM will launch.
</I>&gt;<i> If not then read and report KDM's and Xorg's logs.
</I>&gt;<i> Those files are in /var/log/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On some boxes an /etc/X11/xorg.conf is required.
</I>&gt;<i> If so we will know from examining the logs.
</I>&gt;<i> # X -configure
</I>&gt;<i> will create an xorg.conf and store it in /root/
</I>&gt;<i> or perhaps somewhere else.
</I>&gt;<i> Edit it appropriately and move it to /etc/X11/
</I>&gt;<i> Also verify that the device detected matches with
</I>&gt;<i> output from lspci -v -v
</I>&gt;<i> Feel free to adjust resolution modes to match what
</I>&gt;<i> the monitor and graphics chipset can do.
</I>&gt;<i> Xorg, is not guaranteed to select optimal resolutions.
</I>&gt;<i> The resolution might be lower than maximum
</I>&gt;<i> or it might be maximum and thus cause a monitor
</I>&gt;<i> to go into interlace mode and flicker.
</I>&gt;<i> Many CRTs work fine at 1024x768,
</I>&gt;<i> but can also do 1280x960 mode interlaced.
</I>&gt;<i> My preference is to avoid interlaced mode.
</I>&gt;<i> A DFP, digital flat panel might be capable of 1920x1080.
</I>&gt;<i> Some laptop displays support the same dimension but
</I>&gt;<i> not as high a resolution.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know if they will be damaged by trying to force
</I>&gt;<i> a higher resolution than designed.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, be careful to read all monitor documentation
</I>&gt;<i> before selecting modes in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the box has a NVIDIA graphics card
</I>&gt;<i> then using the pre-compiled proprietary binary drivers from NVIDIA
</I>&gt;<i> might be preferred for their OpenGL performance.
</I>&gt;<i> If so then write back about the monitors attached
</I>&gt;<i> and a sample configuration file can be found.
</I>&gt;<i> The other possibility is casting the spells
</I>&gt;<i> and creating one's own xorg.conf based upon the installed documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, that is what I did for my two workstations with NVIDIA graphics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My desire is to use the nouveau driver.
</I>&gt;<i> But previous tests produced no usable results.
</I>&gt;<i> And the nv driver that xorg supplies is perhaps better than svga,
</I>&gt;<i> but without hardware accelerated OpenGL graphics.
</I>&gt;<i> NVIDIA cards contain two chipsets,
</I>&gt;<i> one for 2d SVGA and the other for 3D.
</I>&gt;<i> And in the past they provided little to no information that
</I>&gt;<i> would assist open source software authors with writing a driver
</I>&gt;<i> for NVIDIA's 3D chipset.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the chipset is ATI then ATI also provides a pre-compiled proprietary
</I>&gt;<i> driver.
</I>&gt;<i> The spell for it in the grimoire is probably old and obsolete.
</I>&gt;<i> Or perhaps even missing.
</I>&gt;<i> I might have discarded it during the audit.
</I>&gt;<i> I never had much luck writing a decent spell for it.
</I>&gt;<i> But a SA can always download it from the website
</I>&gt;<i> and try installing it as root allowing it to partially corrupt
</I>&gt;<i> their Sorcerer box.
</I>&gt;<i> Provided that immune-exam-integrity does not run and fix it
</I>&gt;<i> then it might be usable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have run both ATI and NVIDIA.
</I>&gt;<i> And my current motherboard has built-in ATI,
</I>&gt;<i> and I still use a NVIDIA graphics card on it.
</I>&gt;<i> I would not say that I like either choices that depend on proprietary
</I>&gt;<i> drivers.
</I>&gt;<i> However, NVIDIA seems to be the lesser of evils.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S.
</I>&gt;<i> Although I already know how /etc/inittab should be
</I>&gt;<i> checking it would not be a bad idea.
</I>&gt;<i> Afterall, a person could report that they accomplished
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; installation when in fact they did a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Sorcerer Modern Magic&quot; installation instead.
</I>&gt;<i> And how would I know, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, if KDE and firefox is desired on a &quot;Sorcerer Modern Magic&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> installation
</I>&gt;<i> then the SA would type
</I>&gt;<i> # augur begin firefox kde; au scry
</I>&gt;<i> and then wait for it.
