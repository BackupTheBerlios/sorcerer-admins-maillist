Some people flame me directly

such as this email list or IRC.

Probably. I also do not know where it is.

I have not visited the Sorcerer IRC channel in ages.
First, xchat is broke.
I might try fixing it again,
but the software authors have not released a new tarball
since 20100529 which is just over 2 years ago.
I wonder if the software authors are not interested
in providing maintenance for it?
It may be suffering from more crushing bugs rather than merely
being incompatible with current glib headers.

Secondly, if I am distracted by someone wanting to chat
then my efficiency drops and the probability of me creating a bug rises.
That also is the reason why I remain constantly logged out of gmail's
chat applet unless someone first requests a chat by email.

I do not intend to cast the impression of a snob.
But since I am the one who writing code, updating spells, rolling I/Rs, etc...
then everyone might prefer that I create adequate implementations
the first time rather than endure a bug at a potentially inconvenient time.

For example, the final bug that I fixed during the modifications of
/etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant was to include a line that I forgot.
Without that line, attempts to start the wpa_supplicant daemon
via the init-script failed.
I did the final portion of the test, discovered and fixed that bug
within the 30 minutes before UTC 00:00
However, if someone had interrupted
then I probably would have failed detect, fix, and commit the bug fixes
to svn prior to the daily grimoire tarball roll.
Instead boxes would receive the slightly bugged
wpa_supplicant init-script that would be unable
to start the daemon.
Then boxes that required that to connect to their network or Internet
would remain offline on their next boot.

Sometimes what seems to be a simple change/modification
might require longer than anticipated to properly implement.
Then, almost without my realization time slips away
and I am looking at the daily deadline UTC 00:00 fast approaching.
Daily that is always 17:00 for me, which might seem like a boon,
as if my work-day could always end at 17:00.
Yet instead that deadline tends to encourage me to often start work
on a modification late in the day and hack the bugs from it
until late at night.
That way if I feel uncertain about the end result
then I can sleep for 8 hours, awake
and still have ample time for further testing and bug fixing.

Sometimes when I have not stepped in it,
by already making a commit,
then I sometimes delay commits involving hundreds of file modifications
until the next UTC 00:00 merely to ensure
that the changes progress smoothly as anticipated.
Sometimes I test changes on multiple boxes
using both IA32 and x86_64 architecture.
This ensures I have not fixed/circumvented a bug on one architecture
merely to allow it to persist on another.
Sometimes that might require a bit longer than I anticipate,
because IA32 boxes are not rip-roaring fast.
But my point is that I maintain some attention on those tasks
so that I do not accidentally cast the impression
of an absent minder professor,
by introducing new bugs where none previously existed.

Some people are fond of saying, &quot;If it is not broke then do not fix it.&quot;
But that is exactly what I did with /etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant.
And hopefully I did not break it for adding the potential improvement.
Please report if it is not working properly.

BTW, although obvious by now, starting the WPA supplicant daemon
is not controlled by /etc/init.d/networks
nor the network templates and functions.
I separated it, because what appeared in the network functions seemed buggy.
Nobody ever indicate if they used it.
Jan reported that he started the wpa_supplicant daemon as a user.
I also had another good 2 or 3 reasons at the time,
but have already forgot what they were.
But this way I can have some faith that the code
involving wpa_supplicant is working and usable.

Sorcerer boxes have a few different init-script based methods
for helping themselves onto a network.
immune-auto-network provides an init-script that is mostly ideal
for SAs that prefer that their routers instruct boxes to network
configure using a DHCP client.
This might actually help some boxes hop onto their network
without any fancy configuration file edits by the SA.
While I know that it works for wired interfaces
I do not know if it properly works fore wireless devices.
Naturally, nobody automatically hops onto a WPA encrypted network,
because a certificate or key is required.
And of course /etc/init.d/networks might be an adequate method
for most SAs to configure a box for networking provided that the
networking is desired from time of boot.

A SA can always create their own init-script to configure networking.
In the distant past this was the preferred method on Sorcerer,
because we lacked consensus concerning what would
constitute a distribution wide adequate implementation.

Although I have not investigated the possibility
I am aware that udev rules can be used to configure networking.
I suppose by this method networking becomes active
and the interface configured from the moment that the
coldplug or hotplug event is processed.
Does give cause to wonder if udev could also load iptables firewall rules,
although that also can be accomplished by init-script.

The multiple methods for accomplishing
network configuration may seem half-baked
and creates potential for confusion.
However, I realize that SAs do not want for me to deprecate existing methods
without offering something that is at least twice as beautiful as a replacement.
So it came to be this way by me listening to
SA suggestions and implementing them.

However, I vaguely recall that the templates method
was entirely envisioned and the initial implementation contributed.
I only made bug fixing and improvements on that method.

My current position about network configuration is the same as always.
The way the SA makes networking work is the proper method.
Preferably if it can be configured once and run without adjustment
for 3 to 5 years then that seems adequate.

Since networking is a one-shot event of extremely limited duration
almost nobody offers constructive criticism concerning it.
So I was pleased that someone offered a suggestion concerning
wpa_supplicant configuration.

With new I/Rs on the horizon now is the time to offer suggestions.
Suggestions that arrive too late for discussion and evaluation will likely
have their potential implementation and testing suspend until the next cycle.
Too much ambition in too short a span of time creates too many bugs.  :)
