<PRE>Umm yeah. I hit the keyboard and nothing happens. I'pm using linux right
now but Knoppix. LInux Mint won't install now. I'm tryi8ng ot put the new
puppy linux on my flash drive and I will learn linux through debian and
Slackware since I cannot install Sorcerer right now. Battle For Wesnoth is
my favorite game and I have it on my phone. WHen I switched to KDE on
Ubuntu things stopped working and i had to go back to gnome. I like
enlightnement but it's not ready yet but it can be imporved if people tell
how to improve it. RIght now I'm using LXDE which is lightweight and fast.
I'm learning packages through the old way of learning Debian with
Dependency hell. Need any advice on what I test out? I test things all the
time by myself to see what works and even games. Not everything works. But
I like testing things out. All I can do is test out programs. I'll try the
desktop recorder and see if it works and then show you the installation
once I get virtual box but I'm going through dependencies to get there at
the moment. I'll help in any way that I can.

I'm dedicated to you and right now I have all the time in the world. My
business is about going to work when I want to work and then I get paid for
when I work. SO, I'm dedicated to Sorcerer but I need to learn Linux
through learning how to use Linux through other systems. We can do this. My
friends tell me all the news too.

&gt;<i> Come to think of it...
</I>&gt;<i> With Evert's description I imagined
</I>&gt;<i> how the screen looks when KDE or GNOME crashes or fails to start X.
</I>&gt;<i> Often that results in the active virtual console lacking a getty.
</I>&gt;<i> That is because Xorg will always start on a virtual console
</I>&gt;<i> where a getty is not present.
</I>&gt;<i> So for the sake of argument let us assume that
</I>&gt;<i> xorg is crashing and the virtual console is #8.
</I>&gt;<i> Not much to do on a virtual console without a getty.
</I>&gt;<i> So I would press ctrl-alt-f1 or just alt-f1 in order to
</I>&gt;<i> switch to virtual console #1.
</I>&gt;<i> Connected to virtual machine through a vnc client
</I>&gt;<i> I would switch virtual consoles
</I>&gt;<i> by using alt-left-arrow-key or alt-right-arrow-key.
</I>&gt;<i> There I could log in and explore the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> I would definitely want to read
</I>&gt;<i> # dmesg
</I>&gt;<i> and the file /var/log/Xorg.0.log
</I>&gt;<i> And probably also the system log.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of my boxes have an /etc/X11/xorg.conf
</I>&gt;<i> Xorg is supposed to run fine without.
</I>&gt;<i> But that maybe that is the exception rather than the norm.
</I>&gt;<i> So I would probably execute
</I>&gt;<i> # man Xorg
</I>&gt;<i> Worth reading all of it.
</I>&gt;<i> reading
</I>&gt;<i> # man xorg.conf
</I>&gt;<i> is also worthy.
</I>&gt;<i> Then I would start xorg with the parameter to probe for hardware
</I>&gt;<i> and write a configuration file.
</I>&gt;<i> Then I would edit the configuration file and copy it to the proper
</I>&gt;<i> location.
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I would execute a command such as
</I>&gt;<i> # ( /etc/init.d/kdm stop; sleep 5; /etc/init.d/kdm start ) &amp; exit
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then I could see if that solved the problem and provides the KDM login GUI.
</I>&gt;<i> For detailed instructions please read the manual pages,
</I>&gt;<i> since I also do not memorize that information, but merely read it as
</I>&gt;<i> required.
</I>&gt;<i> Configuring Xorg for a box is a one-time event, sort of like networking.
</I>&gt;<i> So I spend between 1 and 5 minutes on the task and then am done.
</I>&gt;<i> And if all else fails try reading
</I>&gt;<i> # man vesa
</I>&gt;<i> and configuring the driver for vesa.
</I>&gt;<i> The VESA compatible extensions on most cards can provide
</I>&gt;<i> nearly full access to the resolution and color depth a card
</I>&gt;<i> is capable of at a small cost in reduced speed.
</I>&gt;<i> Video drivers for native are faster, but vesa often works.
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, some cards have a kernel component a DRM module
</I>&gt;<i> that can be loaded.
</I>&gt;<i> Some can be accessed adequately through the Linux Frame Buffer.
</I>&gt;<i> In some respects that is similar to VESA, but it differs.
</I>&gt;<i> Read
</I>&gt;<i> # man fbdev
</I>&gt;<i> for information about how to modify xorg.conf to use it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Native driver, vesa, or fbdev are the 3 methods that can normally
</I>&gt;<i> be used for some, but perhaps not all video cards.
</I>&gt;<i> Plenty of native drivers exist and the one to select is based upon the
</I>&gt;<i> chipset.
</I>&gt;<i> Since nearly every xf86-video-* driver is installed on a Sorcerer box
</I>&gt;<i> xorg can typically auto-probe and select the proper native driver.
</I>&gt;<i> If it fails at that, then it typically selects vesa.
</I>&gt;<i> Use of the frame buffer device is typically available to both those
</I>&gt;<i> that have the hardware and know to configure xorg to use it.
</I>&gt;<i> If configured with the driver then xorg will automatically load the module.
</I>&gt;<i> However, xorg will not automatically load any of the modules
</I>&gt;<i> associated with the linux frame buffer for probing in order to
</I>&gt;<i> automatically create an xorg.conf configuration file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably such modules are available in
</I>&gt;<i> /lib/modules/$( uname -r )/kernel/drivers/video/
</I>&gt;<i> More important is the description of which module does what.
</I>&gt;<i> That can be viewed by running make menuconfig
</I>&gt;<i> in /usr/src/linux provided that a linux kernel was compiled
</I>&gt;<i> and installed by
</I>&gt;<i> # au begin linux
</I>&gt;<i> or an update of installed linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aside from the help descriptions available when creating a kernel
</I>&gt;<i> configuration
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know where else those modules are verbosely listed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_framebuffer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_framebuffer</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Framebuffer-HOWTO/">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Framebuffer-HOWTO/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, that seems less than comprehensive.
</I>&gt;<i> I recommend untarring a linux source tarball somewhere on /tmp
</I>&gt;<i> and running make menuconfig and finding the drivers and reading
</I>&gt;<i> the help descriptions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My ignorance is probably too great for my opinion to be worthy,
</I>&gt;<i> but I have rarely had an interest in using frame buffer as opposed
</I>&gt;<i> to the native chipset or vesa driver for xorg.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the frame buffer device presents some interesting options
</I>&gt;<i> for those who want to do graphics without the benefit of running an X
</I>&gt;<i> server.
</I>&gt;<i> The combination of linux-fusion and DirectFB can make for some nifty
</I>&gt;<i> output.
</I>&gt;<i> In many years prior, maybe even nearly a decade,
</I>&gt;<i> a method existed to do svga/vga output without X.
</I>&gt;<i> It was perhaps earlier versions of a frame buffer or something
</I>&gt;<i> slightly different.
</I>&gt;<i> My recollection does not recall the necessity of loading a module to use
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it involved a library such as libsvga?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> X is considered bulky, even more so with a window manager,
</I>&gt;<i> and far more so with a desktop environment such as KDE.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, the concept of programs with
</I>&gt;<i> nearly direct access to the frame buffer
</I>&gt;<i> from a reasonable sized library
</I>&gt;<i> was probably of interest to those wanting to build embedded systems
</I>&gt;<i> and gadgets that have limited capabilities and limited RAM and ROM space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is using the frame buffer faster and better than native chipset xorg
</I>&gt;<i> drivers?
</I>&gt;<i> In the past it was not so.
</I>&gt;<i> Whether it is still so I do not know.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, try first with an xorg native chipset driver.
</I>&gt;<i> And Evert was &quot;right-on&quot; for suggesting identifying the graphics
</I>&gt;<i> chipset using output from
</I>&gt;<i> # lspci -v
</I>&gt;<i> If that fails then try the vesa driver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If that fails then one could always burn ample luck or hours
</I>&gt;<i> trying to make xorg work with the linux frame buffer.
</I>&gt;<i> Might work in 5 minutes, or require 5 hours of effort.
</I>&gt;<i> And it might require no more effort than modifying just
</I>&gt;<i> one line in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
</I>&gt;<i> But I do not know, since years have elapsed since I last tried.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The good aspect about creating an xorg.conf file is
</I>&gt;<i> that almost no reasonably recent SVGA monitor
</I>&gt;<i> requires mode lines in the configuration file.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know who else remembers reading monitor documentation
</I>&gt;<i> and the back of monitors in order to create proper mode lines for XFree86.
</I>&gt;<i> It was something of a problem back in early days.
</I>&gt;<i> And setting a mode that was impossible to accomplish
</I>&gt;<i> had the possibility of destroying some monitors
</I>&gt;<i> or detonating/frying important monitor components.
</I>&gt;<i> So what I wrote about creating an xorg.conf file above
</I>&gt;<i> might seem complicated,
</I>&gt;<i> but today is way easier than a decade or more ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, if the problem of booting to a KDE GUI persists,
</I>&gt;<i> because xorg crashes
</I>&gt;<i> then the way to boot the box without going into runlevel 4 or 5,
</I>&gt;<i> which launches the login GUI,
</I>&gt;<i> is to boot into runlevel 3.
</I>&gt;<i> And that is easily accomplished.
</I>&gt;<i> Just give 3 as an additional parameter to the linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When the countdown displays during booting,
</I>&gt;<i> press down arrow
</I>&gt;<i> then select the label to boot
</I>&gt;<i> press tab to receive a boot password prompt.
</I>&gt;<i> If the password is correctly entered
</I>&gt;<i> then the kernel's command line parameters are displayed.
</I>&gt;<i> Now press space and add &quot;3&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Type 3 without the double quotes and press enter.
</I>&gt;<i> And just like that the box will boot into run level 3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The default run level can be changed by editing file
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/inittab
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That might seem advanced or esoteric,
</I>&gt;<i> but one gains an idea of how those things work after reading:
</I>&gt;<i> linux kernel documentation;
</I>&gt;<i> extlinux from the syslinux project documentation;
</I>&gt;<i> and the manual page for inittab.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps everyone eventually reads those.
</I>&gt;<i> They are both useful and somewhat fascinating.
</I>&gt;<i> Or at the very least I find
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/src/linux/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
</I>&gt;<i> to be fascinating.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Historically, BIOS would perform a check of RAM on every boot.
</I>&gt;<i> Back in the 1980-90s period this check could be set to fast
</I>&gt;<i> or a rather slow several minute test.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know if modern BIOS will do this.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the kernel for example supports the memtest parameter
</I>&gt;<i> which the kernel-parameters.txt file explains
</I>&gt;<i> I have yet to try it.
</I>&gt;<i> But if I had doubts about instability and segmentation faulting
</I>&gt;<i> being caused by faulty RAM
</I>&gt;<i> then I would probably want to give this a try.
</I>&gt;<i> Other possibilities would be slightly lowering the drive speed of the RAM,
</I>&gt;<i> or slightly increasing the the voltage to the RAM.
</I>&gt;<i> Some BIOS/CMOS configuration programs permit that and others do not.
</I>&gt;<i> Replacing faulty RAM is always the best choice.
</I>&gt;<i> However, linux might be able to spot and circumvent regions of bad memory.
</I>&gt;<i> Nifty things such as the memtest parameter
</I>&gt;<i> can be learned from reading files in
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/src/linux/Documentation/

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Demetri, from your description of the problem, it sounds like you have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; video driver problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you give us your hardware configuration, I might be able to give you
</I>&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pointers on how to set it up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When you see the blinking cursor, Hold down &quot;Ctrl&quot; and hit &quot;C&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You should now be able to log in.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Enter lspci and hit &quot;Enter&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This will give you a list of what hardware is in your system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you feel like troubleshooting this issue for yourself, read:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; /var/log/Xorg.0.log
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; See what modules are being loaded to get your X going, and where it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; failing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can edit /etc/X11/xorg.cfg, but please read the manual on that
</I>&gt;<i> first, by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; running man xorg.cfg
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can test various configurations by running &quot;startx&quot; When successful,
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will get a very basic window manager instead of that blinking cursor. If
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get the cursor again, you get to try again, free of charge.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When you finally have a working X config, exit out of the window manager
</I>&gt;<i> by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; either pressing &quot;Ctrl&quot; and &quot;Backspace&quot; together, or typing &quot;exit&quot; into
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; left-most terminal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Once you exit there, you can start the proper window manager by entering:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; /etc/init.d/kdm restart
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and hitting Enter.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good luck.
