<PRE>Now I have to figure out how to install Sorcerer dual booted on my machine.
Installation did not work at all and right now sometimes I don't have
internet but I can try a virtual machine. Sorry I am on my phone and can't
delete what is below.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I followed your advice and I was able to dual-boot Sorcerer. I just wanted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to say thanks for the advice, it really helped.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the persistence. It's lightyears removed from the first Sorcery
</I>&gt;<i> install I did nearly eight years ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Oh, and also--
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> P.S. it's not often that we get a newbie around here, and your questions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and remarks are incredibly important to us in making Sorcery more newbie
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> friendly. So, please feel free to jot down what you have problems with,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what you found easy and your overall user experience... and send that back
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to us to help us improve.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah, I'm one of those motivated newbies who starts of at the deep end of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things and learns on the way :) As for Sorcerer being newbie friendly...I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand that it isn't what this distro really aims for when I downloaded
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it, so with that being considered, installation isn't uneccessarily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grueling, at least from a newbie's perspective :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think you can hang up your newb hat about now, and start eying that
</I>&gt;<i> hacker hat. ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Anyway, the only trouble I'm having with it so far is getting my wireless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> card to be recognized and trying to install the firmware needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, if you manage this feat, you definitely do not deserve to be called
</I>&gt;<i> newb anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> Use the utility lspci to find out who made the wireless card that you
</I>&gt;<i> have, read as much as you can about it. I have an iwlwifi card in my
</I>&gt;<i> laptop, and can probably help you if you have something similar, or at
</I>&gt;<i> least point you in the right direction. It may just be that we don't have
</I>&gt;<i> firmware for your card yet, but with a good enough description, we can hack
</I>&gt;<i> something together that might work for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, that is only step 1. Actually connecting to a wireless
</I>&gt;<i> network is a little more painful than it needs to be, as I have been unable
</I>&gt;<i> to find a GUI that works in KDE and can set up my wifi. I try about once a
</I>&gt;<i> year, and have given up in disgust a few times now.
</I>&gt;<i> I can tell you the steps I take, and Kyle might have his own take on
</I>&gt;<i> things, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But as far as installation goes, I don't think you have to be worried
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about it not being intuitive or user friendly to anyone who has even a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> little experience installing other distributions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In fact, installing it was easier than some other distros I've tried.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the compliment!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, thanks a lot for helping me with dual-booting (although probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sometime in the future I'll switch to just Sorcerer, when I can completely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be independent of Windows :))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wish I could be completely free of Windows too. This may sound a bit
</I>&gt;<i> like a rant because it probably will be, but what's up with hardware
</I>&gt;<i> manufacturers that use Linux internally, and then does not have a Linux
</I>&gt;<i> client of their software so someone that uses linux can actually upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> firmware, etc? It's like a slap in the face!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I tell you, I would gladly pay USD 1000.00 for a phone that I am able to
</I>&gt;<i> do a firmware update on in Linux. Same goes for a GPS...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/rant&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyways, Leanna, glad to have you on board. I hope it's all plain sailing
</I>&gt;<i> from now on. If you have any specific Sorcerer questions, please do not
</I>&gt;<i> hesitate to ask either me, or Kyle, or post the question to the list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope you have a groovy week.
