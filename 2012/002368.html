&gt;<i>  Hi there

</I>
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/">http://www.tldp.org/</A>

&quot;The Linux Documentation Project&quot;
has HowTos, Guides, FAQs ( frequently asked questions and answers )
Good reading there.


&gt;<i> That is why I would love if there
</I>&gt;<i> was an Install-script that could install the Kernel and the Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> extensions on any computer, at least on Lenovo-Thinkpad.
</I>
I do not support supplanting a previously installed distro,
by sloppily overwriting it's files without generating a new file system,
because I would never do that.

I would boot an I/R, repartition, initialize file systems,
and install using the menu driven installer program.
If that option does not exist
then a user could install Sorcerer into a virtual computer.


&gt;<i> If you put such a script on your HP, you would certainly gain many more users for Sorcerer.
</I>
Provide a script that would wreck a deployed distribution,
that would cause glibc to refuse loading ELF executables,
and cause a box to become unable to boot?
So after it DESTROYS the installed operating system
and renders the box unbootable,
and the user also lacks a bootable I/R
then that computer user would become a Sorcerer SA,
even though their box does not boot, can not run programs, and can not
be updated?
Hmm... perhaps the possibility merits more consideration than I
previously granted?

&gt;<i> I'm not quite acquainted with how Sorcerer works but, If you gave the
</I>&gt;<i> Cast-script the abillity to find a program's source from the users
</I>&gt;<i> input (cast &lt;program-name&gt;) and gave the user a possibility, via
</I>&gt;<i> numbers, to choose the right program from the ones Cast found on the
</I>&gt;<i> net, it would be very popular.
</I>
Such as cast being able to install more than 3000 software projects
from source tarballs that &quot;leech&quot; downloads on demand from the Internet?
Wow, what a fantastic idea.
I am glad I conjectured and implemented that more than a decade ago.  :)

BTW, the sorcery tools: augur, cast, dispel, leech all provide
bash command line parameter completion hints.
However, I usually type the exact spell name,
and I do not invoke cast, dispel, leech with parameters.
I use augur instead.

The sorcery tools are designed to be the source based administration
tools of a Sorcerer box,
which is without a pre-compiled binary package based manager such as rpm dpkg.
Sorcery is not a user run complimentary tool such as provided by the
0install project.
The 0install project allows installation of pre-compiled binary packages
within a user's home directory.
This allows users easy access to software that the SA might not have provided.

The earliest versions of sorcery, from over a decade ago, were intended
to be a complimentary tool for installing software projects from source tarballs
on my deployed Debian boxes.
However, SAs flooded me with requests to make sorcery into it's own distribution
and to provide a bootable Install/Rescue ISO9660 image.
And so I did, and that was how Sorcerer came into being.
Originally, I only wanted a tool for source based administration,
and I did not want an entire distribution.
However, situations do not always evolve according to personal preference.

The sorcery tool can not be used as a complimentary tool for another
distribution.
The full list of reasons, which would require several pages to
explicate, I will omit.

I am not displeased to have Sorcerer boxes.
The distribution runs excellent.
And none of the information about installed software
is obscured inside of a database.
It is all laid out in easily accessed text files.
The only aspect that anyone might be tempted to complain about,
is that installation from source requires time, processing power, and RAM
in order to accomplish.
However, installation from source is not without benefits
that more than compensate for the expense.
Novice SAs that disagree deploy pre-compiled binary package based
distros instead.

What I said above should provide reason for why
 I have no desire to regress sorcery
into a tool that it was a very, very long time ago
back before it had a requirement system.

<A HREF="http://sourcer.sourceforge.net/">http://sourcer.sourceforge.net/</A>

That project might be desirable.
Also it might have died in 2002.
It might even have contributed to disinformation
that suggested Sorcerer was a dead project,
although Sorcerer has been maintained and provided for more than a decade.

At some point in the distant past
the sourcer software project author
contacted me with the request
for merging his project with mine.
However, I declined because the level of advancement
between our two projects was sufficiently dissimilar.
Imagine a lumbricus terrestris mating with a homosapien.
Exactly.

There it is, or was, a blast from the past.
However, instead I suggest using the 0install project.
<A HREF="http://0install.net/">http://0install.net/</A>
It is currently being maintained,
and in some ways is more creative and advanced than Sorcerer.

However, it is a very different approach to software acquisition.
Therefore, the two projects would never be in competition,
because our niche is too dissimilar.
However, 0install could be used on a Sorcerer box,
if the SA permits the loading of the required kernel module.
That way users could quickly install software and try it
to decide if it seems worthy of deployment
but without all the resource expense that would be required
for installation by sorcery.

0install project aims to be the ultimate companion software.
I know almost nothing about their niche.
Maybe it is the only project, or maybe it is the best, or worst?
I do not know.
Those two are the only software projects that I know about
which are or were competing in the companion niche.
sorcery departed that niche more than a decade ago,
and will not be regressing.
