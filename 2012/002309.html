<PRE>I was wanting to install the Sorcerer Sentient box but from looking at it
I would have to lose the other two operating systems on my hard drive
in the process and there didn't seem to be an option to set it up any
differently than erasing the hard drive and only putting the Sorcerer
Sentient
box on if I wanted that.

I was then looking at the the other installation method and figured
everything out until I came to the compiling part. It was my first time
seeing something like that and I didn't know my system all that well.
I got stuck on the modem options part just after the first software options.

I haven't installed too many operating systems, but I was having a little
trouble until the compiling but figured them out I think. When I have time
next weekend I'll look into it again and try to install again.

I like the Sorcerer Sentient option if it wouldn't replace everything on my
hard drive with Sorcerer. If that could be fixed, then I'd recommend
Sorcerer
to more people.

Once I try to install again I'll take some notes and tell what I think. I
had
some difficultly before compiling, but they turned out alright and since I
don't
for sure and didn't get to compiling, I don't know if they would have
worked all
the way or not. It doesn't seem way too complicated but there's some
confusion.

I'm just learning and want to know as much as I can about how everything
works,
but right now I'm just figuring things out one step at a time until I can
know
everything I can about an operating system.

I'll figure the installation out again this next weekend when I have some
time.

Thanks,
Demetri Salamander

P.S. I have 200GB saved for the Sorcerer installation on my desktop and
then later
in the future I'll put it on my laptop.

&gt;<i> Thanks for inviting everyone to the IRC channel.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I already spent most of the day pounding wpa_supplicant.
</I>&gt;<i> And now my head is pounding me back.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Development on the project continues even in 2012, apparently.
</I>&gt;<i> But it's all dev/unstable in git and not rolled into tarballs.
</I>&gt;<i> I did a git checkout to see if some bugs still persist.
</I>&gt;<i> And they do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I wrote an init-script to start wpa_supplicant
</I>&gt;<i> for all wireless interfaces during boot.
</I>&gt;<i> That seems good, works even.
</I>&gt;<i> wpa-psk works on my new wireless router and Sorcerer boxes.
</I>&gt;<i> However, wpa_cli does not seem to communicate with wpa_supplicant.
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone immediately know why?
</I>&gt;<i> I expect someone with more experience using wpa_supplicant
</I>&gt;<i> might have already encountered and fixed the problem on their box.
</I>&gt;<i> Might be a bug in wpa_supplicant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking of bugs...
</I>&gt;<i> kdm might not at boot in runlevel 4.
</I>&gt;<i> Saw that happen.
</I>&gt;<i> Have not had time to investigate.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone already know why?
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect it had something to do with /etc/init.d/depmod,
</I>&gt;<i> but maybe not, in either case I rewrote that because
</I>&gt;<i> depmod -A does not work as expected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, both the proprietary ?packages? for installing
</I>&gt;<i> NVIDIA and ATI graphics drivers aught to work.
</I>&gt;<i> I check and repair of them recently.
</I>&gt;<i> ati-driver-installer is now renamed to amd-driver-installer.
</I>&gt;<i> And I did find and fix the reason for why it was not
</I>&gt;<i> compiling and installing a kernel module.
</I>&gt;<i> It was not actually a spell problem, but appears
</I>&gt;<i> to be a problem with the package.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I was able to circumvent the problem with the spell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I updated the wpa_supplicant and networks spells.
</I>&gt;<i> Those aught to work a little bit better.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if wpa_cli is unable to communicate with wpa_supplicant
</I>&gt;<i> then perhaps the only way to make wpa_supplicant perform
</I>&gt;<i> is to have a proper config file for it.
</I>&gt;<i> So I eventually want to fix that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for answering questions on the IRC channel.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not make much time to chat.
</I>&gt;<i> I tend to answer inquiries by email,
</I>&gt;<i> and then often too verbosely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I spent the past few weeks doing debugging stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> I fixed a massive amount of spells, tossed some old ones,
</I>&gt;<i> improved some existing ones, etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh speaking about bugs again...
</I>&gt;<i> Something that installs after gdk-pixbuf is capable of breaking it.
</I>&gt;<i> Then other programs like gimp will encounter a compile error
</I>&gt;<i> until gdk-pixbuf is cast again.
</I>&gt;<i> The problem might only occur on some boxes.
</I>&gt;<i> I have yet to identify the culprit.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone have a hunch about it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although I intend to roll new I/Rs sometimes this month
</I>&gt;<i> I still have much on my todo list that gives cause for
</I>&gt;<i> irritation if I roll I/Rs the way that they currently are.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realize that Sorcerer Sentient boxes have some bugs.
</I>&gt;<i> If any are too annoying might want to consider
</I>&gt;<i> transitioning the box to Sorcerer Modern Magic.
</I>&gt;<i> I only update Sorcerer Sentient's grimoire
</I>&gt;<i> when I roll new I/Rs.
</I>&gt;<i> That is when I estimate that the grimoire
</I>&gt;<i> spells and installed software are most optimal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone who wants to pursue and squish any
</I>&gt;<i> of the bugs listed above please be my guest
</I>&gt;<i> and report the outcome.
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone idling in the channel awaiting conversation feels disappointed
</I>&gt;<i> then please wield a bug swatter and smite the bugs.
</I>&gt;<i> The sooner these bugs are smote the sooner we can enjoy new I/Rs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. I want to deprecate lilo
</I>&gt;<i> and totally have any Sorcerer boxes with lilo installed
</I>&gt;<i> automatically transition to extlinux.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet, the automatic transition has a small probability of breaking,
</I>&gt;<i> and definitely will not import customized lilo head and tail files.
</I>&gt;<i> Overall I feel very pleased with extlinux, with just one
</I>&gt;<i> bug presently causing irritation.
</I>&gt;<i> But I already reported it on their email list
</I>&gt;<i> and so maybe they will slay it sometime soon.
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have objects concerning a
</I>&gt;<i> forced automatic transition to extlinux?
</I>&gt;<i> I forgot how long we have been using extlinux now,
</I>&gt;<i> at least 6 months if not a year.
</I>&gt;<i> Decent is it not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did not know if extlinux would be suitable at first.
</I>&gt;<i> However, hindsight is better than leaping before looking.
</I>&gt;<i> So now I feel satisfied.
</I>&gt;<i> Please voice contrary opinions.
</I>&gt;<i>
