<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Sorcerer boxes provide directories
that are not present on other distros.
Until now the plethora of directories
gives Sorcerer a sloppy appearance.
Thankfully retrospect provides a solution.
These directories are moving into
the /aux directory hierarchy.

Former                Newer
/etc.sav/              /aux/use/etc/
/etc.ori/               /aux/new/etc/
/lib64.sav/            /aux/fit/lib64/
/lib.sav/               /aux/fit/lib/
/var/cache/old/     /aux/old/
/var/cache/tmp/    /aux/tmp/

Here is the reasoning.
First, these directories belong on the root file system.
That way their content is available when / is mounted.
This could be important if software to run
is currently having a &quot;Miss ELF&quot; event
and requires formerly installed libraries
that are available only in /aux/old/

Second, the use of /aux/use/
for storing customized configuration files
during upgrades or while spells are dispelled
allows for easy storage of any customized file
instead of only files from /etc/
Only a few odd software projects
fail to store their configuration files in /etc
KDE is or was among them.

Files placed in /aux/tmp/ are hard linked into /aux/old/
therefore those must exist on the same file system.

I might yet consign more directories to /aux-blivion  :)
Actually, /aux is short for /auxiliary
/auxiliary seems like much to type.

I am making this announcement for two reasons.
First, I apologize if creating an inconvenience by using /aux
As far as I know /aux is not used.
Please correct me if I am incorrect.
Second, please do not rm -fr /aux
It is providing a service.

However, if a SA dares to clear the old cache
while a &quot;Miss ELF&quot; event is ongoing
then I can understand executing the commands
# rm -fr /aux/old; ldconfig
I will also understand if the box refuses to run some
or all installed software after that command executes.
Be very certain about what will break
when manually removing the old cache.

BTW, previously, the old cache was /var/cache/old/
Consequently, libraries in it did not become available
until after /var/ or /var/cache/ mounts.
That should not have caused problems on Sorcerer boxes.
However, having it on / eliminates any possibility.

If a verbose explanation is desired
then install immune-help-guide
and then visit each directory
using a bash shell root command prompt.
By collating these Sorcerer specific directories
and providing a tour guide;
new SAs should be able to quickly grasp
the importance and use of the auxiliary directories.
</PRE>
