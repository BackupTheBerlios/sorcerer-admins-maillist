<PRE>For a few years boxes had at least two roots.
The first root is / and is on a file system of type rootfs.
rootfs is like a tmpfs, but without explicit limitations.
Therefore, the content can be swapped.

When booting first BIOS runs.
Then BIOS loads and executes the code
in the MBR of a device such as a fixed disk.
The code in the MBR loads runs the code
from the boot block of the first partition
with the bootable flag.
The code in the boot block of that partition is the bootloader.
The bootloader loads initramfs images and linux into memory.
linux begins executing and unpacks
the content of the initramfs onto the rootfs.
Then linux executes /init on the rootfs.

Boxes could boot without loading initramfs
when the kernel has all necessary modules
compiled directly into it or when the initramfs
linked into the kernel is adequately populated
with modules and code for mounting the real root file system.
However, in general having separate initramfs loaded
provides the benefits of easily being able
to update the initramfs when installed software is updated
and also having a kernel where modules
can be unloaded and then reloaded when a bug occurs.

However, even without virtualization
boxes can have multiple root file systems.
For wanting to maintain the appearance of simplicity
I hid that fact until hyping the benefits
of retaining a populated rootfs.
Then, I revealed that the real root file system was
mounted on /media/root/ from the perspective of the rootfs.
However, this has changed.

The real root file system is now mounted on
/media/root/real/
A box can have additional root file systems mounted as
/media/root/test/
/media/root/work/
as an example.

/media/root/test/ for example could be used for testing updates
and by running services on alternate port numbers
so an updated httpd could be started and it's performance
evaluated on port 8080 before updating the software in /media/root/real/
where the production web server is running on port 80.

Each root file system receives it's own private cgroup.
Therefore, the use of task files to replace PID files
will still function as expected.
The runlevel of a root file system is executed when
/etc/init.d/prc of the root file system has the executable mode.
And root file systems are specified in /etc/fstab.rootfs
root file systems can be a mounted device or a bind.
Either will work.
Any file system that appears as /media/root/*/
in the rootfs will be regarded as a root file system.

If not obvious from the above statement
root file systems can exist
on delegated devices or within a file system
that is specified above it in /etc/fstab.rootfs.
Yes, root file systems can be hierarchical if desired.
With the situation of a bind then that would be so.
hierarchical root file systems will not cause problems.

Selecting which getty runs where is accomplished
by editing /etc/inittab

A line would look like:

vc1:12345:respawn:/sbin/chroot-agetty /media/root/real tty1 -8 -h -s 115200

Consequently, the root file system that they getty appears within
can be edited as the first parameter to /sbin/chroot-agetty

Two obvious limitations exist when using multiple roots.
First, a box only has one name.
So when in separate roots try not to become confused.
Adjusting the prompt can help avoid confusion
since prompts tend to display the name of a box,
but not the name of the root file system.
Secondly, only a single process can bind to a port.
If sshd in two roots start and both attempt to bind to port 22
then the first sshd to start wins and the other exits.
An easy way to solve this is to remove the executable mode
from /etc/init.d/sshd in the root that should not run sshd
or by editing /etc/services
and selecting a different port for running sshd.

Multiple root file systems tend to be
easier to wield than virtual computers.
Multiple root file systems have less RAM overhead
than running a virtual computer.
And the full resources can be utilized on an alternate root
where virtual machines must relent a sufficient amount RAM
for the host computer to continue to properly run.
Consequently, virtual computers and multiple root file systems
have different advantages and disadvantages.

For years I have used both both multiple root file systems
and virtual computers concurrently.
It is like the difference between
a phillips screwdriver and a flathead.
Selecting the most appropriate tool
for the task makes the task easier.
