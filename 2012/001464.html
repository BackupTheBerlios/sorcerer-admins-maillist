<PRE>However, mounting devtmpfs on /dev
using the mount command did work.
At first I was hoping that by having devtmpfs and modules
on the initramfs that somehow coldplug events could
be handled automatically without udev.
That was why I started experimenting with it.
However /dev was practically empty until I started loading modules.
I did not read about a way to generate or handle cold plug events
without using udev.
A semi usable substitute for udev was what I hoped to discover.

So far we know that udev works with tmpfs mounted on /dev
Also we know that previous cold plug events can be replicated
by adding coldplug to the kernel command line.
I wrote that code maybe sometime around December last year.
However, we do not know if using devtmpfs on /dev
will work properly with udev.
Is anyone eager to test it?
Currently, /dev is full of nodes that often do not have
the root group owning the node.
I see audio, video, floppy, disk, lp, kmem, tty
The linux-modular kernels already have devtmpfs
compiled into them.
I did not bother removing that after tersting.

x86_64-2.6.32.7:CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y
x86_64-2.6.32.7:CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT=y

And the DEVTMPFS does not mount at boot
as suggested by the documentation.

# grep &quot;/dev &quot; /proc/mounts
tmpfs /dev tmpfs rw,relatime,size=1024k,nr_inodes=65536,mode=755 0 0

Otherwise that would read devtmpfs instead of tmpfs.

So who wants to have devtmpfs mounted on /dev
instead of tmpfs when a kernel has devtmpfs listed in
/proc/filesystems?
And before you cast your vote in favor
then please test it to make certain that
udev rules for ownership and mode are properly applied
for device nodes created by devtmpfs.
