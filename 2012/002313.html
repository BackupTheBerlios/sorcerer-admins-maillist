<PRE>Pidigin has been in the grimoire almost forever,
but used to be called something different.
Perhaps it's old name was gaim?

Interestingly, out of box, not all of pidgin's protocols work.
I already investigated and circumvented the problem;
tested and verified the mended bird.
Consequently, I expect that it aught to be able to fly.
Most of the software on the I/R is also software that I use frequently.
However, pidgin was software that I fixed for someone else.

Glad to know that pidgin does IRC because
xchat recently gained the broke attribute.
xchat software authors made no new release tarballs since 20100529.
It might now be unsupported by it's software authors.
I added an omit date of 20120529 for xchat.
If it is fixed before then then it can stay
otherwise I will remove it from the grimoire sometime after 20120529.

Additionally firefox probably has a downloadable plugin for IRC.
So that is at least two methods that those with &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot;
can participate in IRC without using a website to IRC CGI portal.
And playing games with IRC bots can be amusing or educational
provided that one has sufficient time.
