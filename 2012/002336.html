<PRE>In the previous email I mentioned extlinux.
However, I realized that I forgot to mention something about extlinux.
Something that appears to be a bug has been in extlinux for a while,
and although I reported that the global append did not seem to function properly
I have not yet seen a stable release of syslinux where this problem is fixed.
Anyway....
I wrote a little bit extra into the bootloader config file generator to allow
the content from /etc/extlinux/append to appear in each label on an APPEND line
The per label append works.
Therefore something such as:
acpi_enforce_resources=lax
can be appended at each label.

Instead of allowing a bootloader configuration that will boot anything
the person at the keyboard
is willing to type without prompting for passwords, etc...
the Sorcerer method is to generate when required a fresh bootloader
configuration file
that has each possible label and reasonable restrictions to prevent
anyone from booting
the non default label or adding additional kernel parameters without
also specifying the boot password.
This provides a good compromise between the convenience of being able
to boot/reboot unattended,
the convenience of a menu for selecting alternate kernels or the rescue label,
and the ability append/modify kernel parameters when permission is granted.

The implementation might seem a bit much in terms of effort,
but it might also be the minimal reasonable effort for the intended outcome
considering that the Sorcerer linux kernels
are not adulterated with files from the file system.
Everything that becomes part of Sorcerer's initramfs images
exist in compressed or uncompressed cpio files
that are separate from the linux kernel.
But that is what one comes to expect from Sorcerer.

The design for Sorcerer is like fine dining
where each course comes on a separate plate.
Likewise each portion of the &quot;Sorcerer's Keep&quot;
is a carefully crafted separately generated file,
from the freshest ingredients available on an installed box.

Fast food dining is fried potatoes slung into a paper box
crushed beneath a paper wrapped greasy slab of mystery carcass
coated with condiments and bread.
Forget about &quot;hold the pickles.&quot;
Forget about &quot;I want it cooked now,&quot;
instead sizzling for 45 minutes under an infrared lamp.&quot;
Fast food is get it fast, do not complain, do not ask questions service.

If the components of the &quot;Sorcerer's Keep&quot;
were included as part of the kernel's internal initramfs
then modification might not be possible without at the very least
relinking the previously compiled kernel.
And since Sorcerer boxes are capable
of booting multiple labels for different kernel version;
updating the internal initramfs of each kernel
would not be easily accomplished without also
retaining the compiled source trees for all those kernels.

We have all seen the 1 kernel and 7 initramfs load on each boot.
If BIOS is slow with reading the device
then the appearance of those dots might seem a short eternity.
That may diminish SA interest when box's BIOS is slow
when booting from a USB SSD.
And I also have a box where booting the backup from a USB SSD
seems to require around a quarter of an hour and has a tiny
probability of failure.
The first time I tried it booting it;
I conjectured that it froze,
but I decided to walk away and check it later.
And somehow it progressed,
but not unlike watching water come to a boil.
A 10 year old BIOS is probably required
in order to witness a boot which is that lethargic.
Please pardon the digression.

The reason for the level of bootloader configuration complexity
and loading of the 7 initramfs images is because
the Sorcerer experience is designed to be resume fine dining
prepared on demand from the freshest ingredients.
Therefore, after updates and when a box is shutdown/rebooted
then init-scripts run that check to and determine if a newer bootloader
configuration file or newer initramfs images are required.
If so then those are generated before the current session ends.
That way the next boot has the freshest available software on the
initramfs images.
And that helps eliminate the persistence of both security and annoying
type bugs.

Not only is the installed versions of software on a Sorcerer box a
moving target,
but also the initramfs is a moving target.
Rebooting every other month can be help maintain the quality,
because for the moment, newer initramfs are only loaded into memory upon boot.
Why is this so?
It is this way because also the running kernel does not change version
to a newer installed kernel version unless a box reboots.

Lastly, something about rebooting...
When is rebooting and shutdown safe?
Provided that cast is not running then issuing a shutdown/reboot
command is reasonably safe.
And if xz is running, in order to compress files in
/var/cache/{archive,ccache,sources}/ ,
then this too is also a safe time to reboot.
If file compression is unable to complete
then another attempt is commenced at a later time when the box is running.

The thing not to do is to force power off during shutdown.
Although the scripts have been carefully crafted to avoid the possibility
of crafting a corrupted initramfs image, in theory an impossible probability
exists that a shutdown during the execution of the mv command
that renames the new initramfs might cause a problem.
The worst possible problem might wreck booting,
but is simply more likely that a box might boot a mixture
of old and newer initramfs images.
So forcing a the power off is not something I would do,
but it is also not something I expect to cause a catastrophic problem.

Very rarely a box will detect a problem when running shutdown
and then abort the shutdown/reboot sequence, beep loudly
and rebound itself into a runlevel.
This is usually worth of investigating.
At the very least check logs in /var/log/init to see what happened.
If a box refuses to shutdown/reboot
then the box also expects that it will be unable survive.
In other the box anticipates a strong probability that an Install/Rescue
image will be required on the next boot in that rare situation.

I hope this email demystifies some aspects about booting, shutdown,
and the near 100M of files loaded by BIOS calls from the bootloader on
each boot.
And while it might seem lavish in comparison to other distros;
it provides the high quality of functionality and freshness that we crave.
