<PRE>Hi there, Leanna.

Welcome to Sorcery.

You won't find many Sorcerer admins that are dual-booting, but fortunately
for you, I am one.
I'm sure that I don't have to repeat all the warnings about backing up your
data before trying to install an OS to your hard disk.

Sorcery setup does not support dual booting as such, but does not get in
it's way either.

As such I highly recommend that you use your already installed OS to
re-partition and make space for Sorcery.

If you have the disk space available, 100GB for a single Sorcery partition
would leave you with plenty of room to grow. If free space is tight, you
can still install Sorcery in 40GB of space, but it won't be as comfy.

There is no need to change your bootloader, grub is fine.

Something to watch out for, is that grub and the rest of the world number
partitions differently from each other. In your case, when you make the
sorcery partition, simply make it a unique size, and take a note of that
size. Take a note of the name that Grub calls it, and the size that you
allocated to it.

Now, when you run the Sorcery installer, install to your newly created
partition. It's been a few years since I ran the Sorcerer installer, so I
might be fuzzy on a few details, but I do believe that you can actually
boot in &quot;I/R&quot; ( Install/Rescue ) mode, pop down to the shell and run cfdisk
to inspect your partitions, and see what names sorcery will be giving them.
Please be careful not to write with cfdisk, just take a look and quit
without writing anything to disk.

So, run the installer again, and install Sorcery to the partition that you
created earlier.

Boot into your installed OS, and update GRUB to chainload the partition
that you created.

You should now be able to dual boot between Sorcery and your other OS.

So, let me reply to your other questions:


1. Is it required to set up a wired or wireless connection during
&gt;<i> installation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Not really, but you will need an internet connection for Sorcery when you
want to update/install anything, obviously.
If you have DHCP enabled wired or wireless, Sorcery should detect and use
it automatically.



&gt;<i> 2. Are there any post-install necessities?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Reading lots of manuals, unfortunately.
Fortunately, Kyle included loads of help on the command line. If you find
any of that useful, drop him a mail expressing your gratitude. :)
For starters, you can run sorcery. Just type &quot;sorcery&quot; on the command line,
and press enter. There is a graphical menu to help you.

Later on, you will find that running &quot;augur&quot; directly is more efficient,
but have a good play with the sorcery menu first.



&gt;<i> 3. I went a bit into the installation before rewinding, and I noticed this
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't seem to use the grub bootloader. The thing is, I already have grub.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a way for Sorcerer to use grub, or do I have to install lilo?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Grub is fine, as I explained above.


Any more questions, I will be happy to help.

Kind regards,
-Evert Vorster-

P.S. it's not often that we get a newbie around here, and your questions
and remarks are incredibly important to us in making Sorcery more newbie
friendly. So, please feel free to jot down what you have problems with,
what you found easy and your overall user experience... and send that back
to us to help us improve.
