<PRE>because it all seems very intuitive to me.
However, if someone wants to make corrections modifications and additions
please fix it up and email me the newer versions.

What I wrote currently is a bit too informal
and a bit too verbose.
What would be ideal is something that explains a spell in
5 minutes or less of reading.
Afterall, modern Sorcerer spells are very simple, yes?
Many of them do not even look as if they are BASH script fragments.

The excellent Sorcerer sysvinit has no website docs
and yet we enjoy elegant, small, fast init-scripts
that are as easy to enable and disable as:
chmod a-x /etc/init.d/$file
and
chmod u+x /etc/int.d/$file

And of course is no website docs that describes the current:
augur, cast, dispel, leech, sorcery

And the mystery of /usr/libexec/sorcery/{augur,cast,leech}.d/
is not yet revealed in any website documentation.
Yet for those who want to extend sorcery functionality with
minimal risk of breaking it the plugable methods for cast, leech, and augur
provide the best method since local methods can be installed in
/usr/local/libexec/sorcery/{augur,cast,leech}.d/

Lastly, Sorcerer is largely designed to external specifications.
Sorcerer can run LSB compatible init-scripts,
the filesystem corresponds to the LFHS, and so forth.
Some sort of documentation that provides URLs to documentation
on other websites should exist.

Aside from understanding how Sorcerer sysinit and runlevels work
and how the sorcery tools work, and what spells are and do
then almost everything else about Sorcerer can be researched at
<A HREF="http://tldp.org">http://tldp.org</A>
That aught to be in the Sorcerer website docs somewhere?
There is nothing to fear about Sorcerer
since the software provided by Sorcerer is nearly identical to the
same software supplied by every other distribution.
Except, Sorcerer boxes tend to have newer versions.

I remember something now...
Somewhere there exists a Sorcerer wiki.
Unfortunately, I have no idea where that might be.
However, I would expect that the docs that are newer
than 2002 are at the wiki.
Yet they are probably still too old to describe current Sorcerer.

The fact that Sorcerer documentation has changed little since 2002
is reason enough for many SAs to not want to try Sorcerer.
If more SAs were like you guys who eat HowTos from TLDP in less time
than required to eat breakfast then Sorcerer would barely need docs.
In hindsight that is probably entirely true of current Sorcerer SAs.

However, to welcome yet more talented SAs to help improve Sorcerer
having decent documentation would help.
For some the adventure might seem more entertaining with maps
to help guide them on the path to becoming powerful Sorcerers.

So who else is excited about writing some docs?
Obviously, hindsight shows that
I am the least capable person for writing Sorcerer documentation.
In contrast I do okay at updating Sorcerer and assisting SAs with
troubleshooting.
But that is okay.
Nobody will be great at every aspect.
But if you want to hone up on writing docs now is a great time to start.
I can provide correction of content.
And there is basically no chance that anyone can write docs any worse
than me.  :)
It would be like an automatic improvement for Sorcerer.
And besides all the 2002 docs must go.
Sorcerer of 2002 is hardly even a shadow in similarity when compared
to Sorcerer 2008.

If the new Sorcerer docs were as fun to read
and invoked as much excitement as wielding sorcery
then potential Sorcerer SAs would be hooked
from reading little more than a page of documentation.
It could happen if someone or some people have the vision and ability
to make it so.
Website documentation is definitely the area of Sorcerer development
that is in most dire need of help and improvement.
Sorcerer is like the birthday present that you always wanted,
but wrapped in documentation that is no more colorful than a brown paper sack.
But we could make Sorcerer documentation as colorful and fun as
rainbow wrapping paper with ribbons.

So, let's do it!
Who's with me?
