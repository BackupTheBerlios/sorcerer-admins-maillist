<PRE>Since kde4 is the only supported version of KDE at the moment
kde4 is no longer installed in /opt/kde4 but rather in /usr
Therefore, following updates kde might not respond properly
and could require that running
# /etc/init.d/kdm stop; sleep 10; /etc/init.d/kdm start

The change in location should help allow for some python related modules
to be properly detected and used.
However, the relocation of KDE will probably become problematic when
KDE5 is released.
But since that might not even happen in 2012
we should probably try to enjoy KDE with as much functionality as possible
before the next great upheaval.

The 32bit version of KDE on a multilib system is installed in /opt/32bit/usr
The way KDE stores it's compile information requires the use of different
prefix for the installation of a 64-bit and 32-bit KDE.
I am partially tempted to have /opt/32bit become the new root for all 32-bit
software installed an a multilib system.
Unfortunately, the segregation requires rewrite of too many spells.
I modified only about 150 spells to adjust KDE software installation
from /opt/kde4 to /usr

Also included are some updates for gnome software.
Also included is a udev update.

Those who do not test udev for distro consumption
might be unaware of the prankster nature of udev authors.
These are  funny guys.
About 1/10th of the time a box will fail to reboot after updating udev.
Har har har.

Consequently, I recommend that all boxes have some immediate method for rescue
for when a software update renders a box unbootable.
The immune-boot-resuce spell provides decent coverage.
Having an Install/Rescue CD is also potentially useful.

For those that are wondering why,
I am again disallowing the update of zlib.
The newer version of zlib breaks compilation of vlc.
Not certain what else might break.
vlc was certainly sufficient cause.

Also because the KDE update changes the install location from /opt/kde to /usr
that change necessitates the re-casting of all software that installed
in /opt/kde
Consequently, the update will be sort of like a mini-rebuild for that software.
The update will require a bit longer than usual.
And any SA's clever deviation to omit from recompilation
any of the software installed to /opt/kde4
because neither the spell nor the source tarball differs
will wreck the installation of KDE and make it unusable.
So no questions about why spells must re-cast at the same installed
version, please.
19/20 times when that happens it happens for a good reason rather than a bug.
I did not want to add anything odd to the event logs
so here is the reason.
The install location of KDE is no longer /opt/kde4, but is /usr.
Be aware that customized and locally hosted spells might also require adjustment
if previously expecting a KDE or QT installed in /opt/kde4.

The code to force the re-compilation of all software installed to /opt/kde4
is a temporary function in the sorcery spell.
Like all temporary functions it has a life expectancy of 6 months.
Boxes not updated at least once within every 6 months are
expected to encounter problems with the transition.
So rather than allow a good box succumb to security vulnerabilities
and dig itself into a hole
I recommend installing the immune-sentinel-sync spell.
Contrary to previous implementations the init-script is now configurable
and allows for the SA to specify the amount of days between automatic
synchronization of installed software with the distribution's current norm.

Not everyone is excited about tomoyo on Sorcerer.
Yet I wonder why.
The good news is that I have not changed anything about the
implementation for over a month.
The bad news is /domain/freedom is still a bit long to type.

For the most part all it does is require that the root password
or a password provided to a user
must be typed before granting write access to /bin /sbin /lib /lib64 /etc /usr
That way if EUID 0 is acquired by nefarious methods
/domain/freedom must still be executed and provided with an appropriate password
before significant file system changes are allowed.
By this fashion intruders will encounter a glass wall that no only
impedes progress,
but also eliminates the possibility erasing their presence from log
files on the way out.
Obviously, this implementation of tomoyo is not the best method of
protection because
it does not prevent outright theft of non encrypted data.
However, this method of implementation was selected as a compromise,
because it enforces the traditional linux/POSIX security model rather
than replacing it with a more complicated implementation.
Activating the implementation requires
# cast immune-security-tomoyo
If all the required spells install
then tomoyo with the Sorcerer's implementation for enhanced security
becomes activate on the next boot.

The tomoyo documentation is sweet,
but overall the complexity and preciseness required
is about a magnitude greater than configuration for bind and httpd.
By accepting and accomplishing that task at the distribution level
I am able to provide some tomoyo benefits for SAs
while sparing the SA the days worth of study and trial implementations.
I suppose someone might be able to easily configure tomoyo
for use with a few servers for only 8 hours of study and effort.
I required closer to 80 hours study, effort, debugging, testing, and revision.

I have not yet created new Install/Rescue CDs for 2012.
Maybe that will happen in Feb?
We shall see.
Hope everyone's new year started awesomely.
