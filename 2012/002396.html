<PRE>The &quot;familiar&quot; was a good idea, but a lackluster implementation.
Therefore, &quot;familiar&quot; is already ancient history.

With the next sorcery release these are the utilities:

augur, command line tool;
cast compilation and installation tool;
dispel software removal tool;
expedite for untarring and preparing ccache directories for use by cast;
leech for downloading files;
oust for copying installed files for a spell into /aux/old/;
provision for untarring and preparing source directory for use by cast;
sorcery menu driven configuration and source administration tool.

Basically, the 3 new utilities are expedite, oust, and provision.
As usual they are invoked automatically instead of by the SA.
The reason for the additional programs and additional queues
is to be able to more effectively task additional processes.
Processes such as untarring a source and ccache tarballs
are rate limited to 1 megabyte per second output if not immediately required.
And when sources or ccaches are required for immediate use
then those are provided at near rate unlimited speeds.

ousting of software which copies installed files into /aux/old/
is a useful because ELF libraries that are required by installed software
are still available for use after that software was uninstalled.
Ousting of an installed spell is only required before dispel reaps it's files.
Therefore, if dispel does not explicitly invoke oust
then oust will be ousting all spells in the cast queue
at a meager rate of 1 megabyte per second.

So in general almost all the tasks that previously ran at rate unlimited speeds
now run at 1 megabyte per second when the outcome is not immediately required.
The effect is that I/O is both lighter and spread over a longer duration
while at the same time spells queued for casting gain an opportunity to begin
compilation ASAP because their sources and ccache directories
were probably already untarred in advance.

Evert's response to these improvements was,
&quot;gigabytes of directories are accumulating within /usr/src/sorcery/ccache/&quot;
Consequently, I revised the functioning of sentinels-space
to allow it to tar /usr/src/sorcery/ccache/$SPELL/ directories
when the spell is not in the cast queue.
Naturally, it does this tarring at a rate of 1 megabyte per second.
The effect is that about every 900s the amount of directories in
/usr/src/sorcery/ccache/
are thinned and translated into tarballs in /var/cache/ccache/

Additionally, immune-sentinel-space was granted special dispensation
for running xz at 5% memory consumption
on tarballs in /var/cache/{archive,ccache,sources}
when available disk space in those directories is low.
In the past sentinel-space was not allowed to run xz concurrently with cast.
But now it can when disk space is low.

In general the way to avoid depleting disk space
is to allow the 5% reserve for root
and make file systems sufficiently large.
Do not do rebuilds while the root file system or
/var/cache/ file systems are obviously low on space.
Ousting of installed spells could deplete available space on /
Please remain aware of this possibility
when processing a cast queue that has many entries.

The performance benefit of performing tasks before they are required
mitigates I/O spiking but also requires more disk space.
If 4 spells are casting
then 4 additional source and cacche directories might already be prepared
in /usr/src/sorcery/ to handle the spells that come next in the cast queue.

In the very distant past boxes tended to be low on RAM.
In the distant past boxes tended to have surplus of RAM.
But now boxes tend to be a bit low on RAM again
especially considering that an invocation of the linker
might require a gigabyte of RAM while linking some programs.
These changing tendencies influenced how Sorcerer changed.
Sorcerer for example no longer uses a tmpfs on /usr/src/sorcery/
And the preference for I/O is anticipatory rate limited output.

Anyone who wants near ideal performance for sorcery might consider
granting a non encrypted dedicated 40G ext3 to /usr/src/sorcery/
Also the possibility of a non encrypted dedicated 4G ext4 /tmp/ could
be beneficial.

Lastly, a reminder.
In a previous email I mentioned that failed casts
have their sources moved into /usr/src/sorcery/failed/
and downloading now happens in /var/cache/download/
