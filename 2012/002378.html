<PRE>The selection of software to start during boot
is provided in the form of traditional runlevels.
This is the description from /etc/inittab

# Runlevels
# 0: halt
# 1: sequential init
# 2: parallel   init + multi-user + networking
# 3: sequential init + multi-user + networking
# 4: parallel   init + multi-user + networking + GUI login
# 5: sequential init + multi-user + networking + GUI login
# 6: reboot
# 7: initramfs

On my boxes I use runlevel 3 or runlevel 5.
They require longer to run, but the scroll is more clean
and less confusing during runlevel execution.
However, both 4 and 5 provide the gdm,kdm,xdm GUI login.
If Sorcerer Sentient is installed
then kdm will run if the runlevel is set to 5.
Sorcerer Sentient sets the default runlevel to 4 during installation.
On the previous I/R I verified that this worked.

I recommend verifying that the Sorcerer Sentient installation is complete.
# augur log version sorcerer-sentient
If it is not installed then a version number will not print.
In that event execute:
# augur begin sorcerer-sentient; augur scry
Then wait until all spells are successfully cast.
At that point press q to leave the scry.
Execute
# pgrep -u root cast
If not PIDs are printed then cast is not running.
The box is safe to reboot.
# shutdown -r now
That is the proper reboot command.
Upon reboot KDM will launch.
If not then read and report KDM's and Xorg's logs.
Those files are in /var/log/

On some boxes an /etc/X11/xorg.conf is required.
If so we will know from examining the logs.
# X -configure
will create an xorg.conf and store it in /root/
or perhaps somewhere else.
Edit it appropriately and move it to /etc/X11/
Also verify that the device detected matches with
output from lspci -v -v
Feel free to adjust resolution modes to match what
the monitor and graphics chipset can do.
Xorg, is not guaranteed to select optimal resolutions.
The resolution might be lower than maximum
or it might be maximum and thus cause a monitor
to go into interlace mode and flicker.
Many CRTs work fine at 1024x768,
but can also do 1280x960 mode interlaced.
My preference is to avoid interlaced mode.
A DFP, digital flat panel might be capable of 1920x1080.
Some laptop displays support the same dimension but
not as high a resolution.
I do not know if they will be damaged by trying to force
a higher resolution than designed.
Therefore, be careful to read all monitor documentation
before selecting modes in /etc/X11/xorg.conf

If the box has a NVIDIA graphics card
then using the pre-compiled proprietary binary drivers from NVIDIA
might be preferred for their OpenGL performance.
If so then write back about the monitors attached
and a sample configuration file can be found.
The other possibility is casting the spells
and creating one's own xorg.conf based upon the installed documentation.
Basically, that is what I did for my two workstations with NVIDIA graphics.

My desire is to use the nouveau driver.
But previous tests produced no usable results.
And the nv driver that xorg supplies is perhaps better than svga,
but without hardware accelerated OpenGL graphics.
NVIDIA cards contain two chipsets,
one for 2d SVGA and the other for 3D.
And in the past they provided little to no information that
would assist open source software authors with writing a driver
for NVIDIA's 3D chipset.

If the chipset is ATI then ATI also provides a pre-compiled proprietary driver.
The spell for it in the grimoire is probably old and obsolete.
Or perhaps even missing.
I might have discarded it during the audit.
I never had much luck writing a decent spell for it.
But a SA can always download it from the website
and try installing it as root allowing it to partially corrupt
their Sorcerer box.
Provided that immune-exam-integrity does not run and fix it
then it might be usable.

I have run both ATI and NVIDIA.
And my current motherboard has built-in ATI,
and I still use a NVIDIA graphics card on it.
I would not say that I like either choices that depend on proprietary drivers.
However, NVIDIA seems to be the lesser of evils.

P.S.
Although I already know how /etc/inittab should be
checking it would not be a bad idea.
Afterall, a person could report that they accomplished
a &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; installation when in fact they did a
&quot;Sorcerer Modern Magic&quot; installation instead.
And how would I know, right?

Therefore, if KDE and firefox is desired on a &quot;Sorcerer Modern Magic&quot;
installation
then the SA would type
# augur begin firefox kde; au scry
and then wait for it.
