<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Any day now I could be unleashing a new sorcery and grimoire
that greatly differs from the one in use on deployed boxes.

The main goal of this sorcery revision is to make sorcery scalable
for efficient processor and efficient I/O utilization on large SMP boxes,
such as where the number of available processors is &gt;= 8.

For this to be accomplished the various tasks performed by sorcery utilities
have been appropriately delineated, segregated and delegated to
utilities and queues.
For simplicity the queues and utility names concur.
However, the except is cast and dispel.
The cast and dispel queues still exist, but the utilities do not.
The queues exist as a staging area and as a useful concept/construct.

This is the list of new utilities and queues:
load; moil; post; reap; rush; save; till; wane.
The following describes each queue/utility.
&quot;Load&quot; supplants the &quot;leech&quot; with the same purpose of downloading files.
&quot;Moil&quot; mainly executes the build() portion of a spell which is
frequently compilation.
&quot;Post&quot; install files to /, creates archives, and creates log files.
&quot;Reap&quot; removes files that spell previously installed to /
&quot;Rush&quot; untars a previously generated tarball of ccache generated objects.
&quot;Save&quot; saves customized configuration files so that they can be used
again when a spell updates.
&quot;Till&quot; untars source tarballs, unzips files, and prepares them for use
by &quot;moil.&quot;
&quot;Wane&quot; turns ccache directories back into tarballs, and xz compresses
source, ccache, and archive tarballs.

As usual the SA must only understand the concept of the cast and dispel queue.
Spells in the cast and dispel queue are acted upon as usual when
# augur begin
is executed.
The other queues load automatically as required.

For the symphony of deployment and updating
the orchestration is performed by &quot;wand.&quot;
Wand runs as a daemon while required and has no queue.
Other utilities can impel wand to act by writing to wand's named pipe.

Yes, the names are all 4 letters long, not because I prefer 4 letter words,
but because it makes coding easier for me and the each of the names
has a logical association with the dictionary definition of the word.

The person with a wand conducts an orchestra.
Tilling prepares land for raising crops,
however in Sorcerer context for raising compiled software.
Wane means to make smaller, and that is what it does.
And the rest should be plainly obvious, but if not
then a dictionary will provide the clue.

An interesting aspect about this sorcery is that
with few useful exceptions the utilities tend not
to process queues concurrently with other utilities.
In other words with the except of &quot;load&quot; &quot;moil&quot; and &quot;wane&quot;
which are given liberty to run when possible
the other queue/utilities such as &quot;post&quot; &quot;reap&quot; &quot;rush&quot; &quot;save&quot; &quot;till&quot;
run only when another is not running.
This has the tendency of spreading I/O
instead of concentrating I/O in bursts.

As mentioned previously, the wane utility runs
when it's queue is populated.
However, &quot;wand&quot; throttles &quot;wane's&quot; cpu.shares.
Therefore, when disk space is ample &quot;wane&quot; is starved for cpu.shares.
However, when disk space is dire then &quot;wane&quot; receives
cpu.shares equal to &quot;moil.&quot;
This effectively allows the utilities to climb out of a situation
where available disk space is begin depleted rather than replenished.
And because &quot;wane&quot; runs with such a low cpu.shares value
&quot;wane&quot; tends to consume mostly idle cycles
rather than causing &quot;moil&quot; to slow.
&quot;wane&quot; effectively depreciates and supplants immune-sentinel-space.

I want to commend Evert Vorster for expressing his discontent
which impelled two very important changes.
The first change was to allow a tarball compression agent to run
concurrently within the slow/sorcery cgroup hierarchy
in order to effectively redirect idle and wait cpu cycles
to the task of mitigating disk space consumption.
When first suggested I opposed this idea because
I did not want the agent to run with as much cpu.shares
as granted to the hierarchy slow/sorcery.
However, I later rescinded my objections when
the new sorcery infrastructure became suitable for this task.

Secondly, Evert and I discussed at great length the benefits
of having dedicated file systems to handle files
that posses different levels of volatility.
Evert expressed the results of running with a dedicated root file system
and dedicated /var file system and I listened.
However, I also understand that Sorcerer's use of the file system
differs from a typical pre-compiled binary based distro.
And having those differences identified and segregated could be beneficial.
And I could have made the change long ago,
but was too lazy to implement it until
after Evert expressed an interest and was demonstrating
the use of multiple file systems and dedicated partitions.

Except for the utilities themselves,
which are still provided within
the standard locations within the file system,
almost all sorcery specific things have now
migrated to within the /aux/ hierarchy.

/aux/ has a somewhat strange but logical hierarchy.

/aux/can/ is a silo or storage area.
/aux/can/archive/
/aux/can/ccache/
/aux/can/git/
/aux/can/load/
/aux/can/source/
The above directories supplant the directories
that were previously provided under /var/cache/
The slightly less than obvious
/aux/can/load/ is basically a downloading area
where files are checked and sorted before
transitioning into /aux/can/source/

/aux/fit/
/aux/fit/lib64/
/aux/fit/lib/
Either the lib64 or lib directory will be present within /aux/fit/
It is a copy of the directory from /
at a time when it is determined to be fit.
The reason for /aux/fit/
is for immune-sentinel-elf
to be able to recovery from a critical ELF failure situation.
If /aux/fit/ is ever used
then /aux/bad/ will contain the directories that were rejected.
/aux/bad/ can be removed or analyzed
to determine the cause of the critical ELF failure situation.

/aux/log/
Contains all the logs that were formerly provided in /etc/sorcery/log/
Likewise /var/log/sorcery/event/ is now deprecated
and /aux/log/event/ is used instead.
The SA can copy over old event logs,
however the spell immune-exam-transition will not.
The spell immune-exam-transition will however copy the log files from
/etc/sorcery/log/ and properly edit them.
So the next spell to cast after updating to newer sorcery
should be immune-exam-transition.

/aux/new/
/aux/new/ enhances and supplants the functionality
that was previously provided by /etc.ori/
Pristine new unmodified configuration files from anywhere
on the file system are provided within /aux/new/
This can be used for comparing modified configuration files with stock
or for the purpose of unmodifying a configuration file.
/aux/new/ might seem a bit hidden,
but I do prefer to minimize clutter within /

/aux/run/ supplants the tasks of /usr/src/sorcery/ and /var/cache/sorcery/
So basically, all the action of sorcery happens somewhere within /aux/run/
/aux/run/tmp/grimoire/ contains the merged grimoire.
/aux/run/queues/ contains the queue directories.
And the rest becomes obvious at a glance.

After we finish a resounding chorus of, &quot;I hate it.&quot;
Let us momentarily dismiss our bias and examine
the potential usefulness of this.

First of all, /aux/run/ could be it's own 20G file system
on an unencrypted device.
If so then defragmentting when not in use is as easy as
# rm -fr /aux/run/failed/
Having /aux/run/ on it's own file system on an unencrypted device
is also a splendid idea when / resides on an encrypted device.
The /aux/run/ file system might easily be home
to the most volatile files on a box.

/aux/can/ is a storage area.
It could be on a dedicated file system.
The best size remains something of a mystery.
It must be sufficiently large to handle the flux
of new files and receiving poorly and uncompressed tarballs.
So 30G as a minimum or 40G seems sufficient for the immediate future.

The departure from the previous locations is because the
previous locations were decided by following the recommendations
of the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy.
<A HREF="http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/">http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/</A>
&quot;FHS 2.3 was released January 29, 2004.&quot;
And sorcery was originally designed and initial implementations began in 2000.
And at that time sorcery was intended to be used
as a companion tool on a pre-compiled binary based distro
in order to provide source based administration for some
but not all installed software.
Obviously, modern sorcery has no dependency upon a package management system.
And the aging FHS was designed according to the old paradigm
that describes pre-compiled binary based distros and
not a source based distro such as &quot;Sorcerer Modern Magic.&quot;

/aux/ is short for auxiliary.
Obviously, auxiliary is too difficult to spell and too long to type.
However, as far as I know /aux has not been assigned a dedicated
purpose outside of Sorcerer's usage and nomenclature.
It is part of Sorcerer's own weird file system hierarchy.
And it is suitable for it's purpose for two reasons.
First, /aux/ is only necessary for deployment and updating of boxes,
but otherwise /aux/ is not normally required for a running box.
That should not imply that rm -fr /aux/ is safe.
It is not since important log files would be lost.
Secondly, I have a habit of inventing directories such
as /etc.ori/ /etc.sav/ and that becomes messy.
Placing them within /aux/ creates a more tidy file system.
And such directories are unique to Sorcerer boxes,
which grants another reason for placing Sorcerer specific
directories within /aux/

One of the final changes conflicts with the reasoning
that I gave in the above paragraph.
However, as the cliche goes,
&quot;for every rule an exception exists.&quot;
Boxes will gain
{,/usr}/lib{,64}/.link/ directories
These directories contain hard links to the ELF libraries
and symbolic links to ELF libraries in the directory above.
Because those are hard links they require no additional disk space.
However, please do not remove those .../.link/ directories
because they are cleaned, updated, and populated automatically
by the sorcery utilities.

The .../.link/ directories have become
the most recent incarnation of the
the digital version of the &quot;table cloth trick.&quot;
The &quot;table cloth trick&quot; is to yank a table cloth from
a table without destroying and toppling the glasses,
plates, and dishes that sit upon the table cloth.
Likewise removing ELF libraries for updating
requires a trick in order to allow programs
to continue to be started when the ELF libraries
that they require are no longer in expected locations.
And the .../link/ directories are exactly that trick.

The .link/ directories are subdirectories of the library directory
because this ensures that the hard links will exist on the same
file system as the original files.
And the directory's name is to make obvious the content.
Yes, those are hard linked files.
And they intentionally exist and not accidentally exist.

Weary of reading?
The above demystifies the changes made to the tools and file system.
However, spells have changed also.

All function invocations within spells are now proceeded by with

For example please examine the follow spell which installs the FHS text file.

with version stable 2.3
with role    documentation
with trait   archive_off data
with info    good 20120607
with info    last 20040129
with info    home <A HREF="http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/">http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/</A>
with source  <A HREF="http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/fhs-$VERSION.txt.gz">http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/fhs-$VERSION.txt.gz</A>
with info    cite &quot;linux file system hierarchy&quot;

build(){
 mkdir -pvm 755      $DESTDIR/usr/share
 gzip  -cd $SOURCE &gt; $DESTDIR/usr/share/fhs.txt
 chmod 644           $DESTDIR/usr/share/fhs.txt
}

While it might look redundant it is not without purpose.
The &quot;with&quot; allows for graceful transition to new spell formats in the future.
Previous functions can be renamed, obsoleted, deprecated, or translated.
The with function can inform when a function is no longer present
or provide translation from an old function name to a new name
or any sort of magic that eases transitioning.

Here are some of the nomenclature changes:

category -&gt; role
attribute -&gt; trait
eprovide -&gt; hold
provide -&gt; fill
conflicts -&gt; clash
opts -&gt; also
require -&gt; base
optional -&gt; elect
volatile -&gt; vary

Please forgive me for the nomenclature changes
that I failed to describe above.
The changes mostly replace names that
required more characters with smaller names.
If in the future I use a tab instead of spaces
in order to create the appearance of columns in spells
then I definitely want all function names to be 7 characters or less.

The new function names are slightly less obvious,
but easy to remember with some practice.
And as usual each Sorcerer box comes with
more than 3000 example spells.  :)

As usual this major change in the grimoire
will likely cause a significant sized scroll of error messages
when attempting to index a newer grimoire with an older sorcery.
Please do not become alarmed nor irritated.
The use of &quot;with&quot; will provide an ultimately solution to that in the future.
However, update to newer sorcery might seem bumpy at first.

I have been driving the newer sorcery for over a week and squishing the bugs.
I hope every last bug is flat.
I apologize if bugs happen.
Be aware that newer sorcery will sometimes drive a higher loadavg.
Although the loadavg should not appear to be like a fork bomb.
That would be a bug.
The higher loadavg is because many of the utilities can run concurrently.
However, the higher loadavg is intentional rather than incidental.
&quot;load&quot; &quot;post&quot; &quot;reap&quot; &quot;rush&quot; &quot;save&quot; &quot;till&quot; &quot;wane&quot; are allowed to run,
but at much lower cpu.shares than &quot;moil.&quot;
This causes a starvation effect where the other utilities have
a longer duration and raise the loadavg.
However, this is exactly what is desired.

&quot;load&quot; &quot;post&quot; &quot;reap&quot; &quot;rush&quot; &quot;save&quot; &quot;till&quot; and &quot;wane&quot;
tend to be I/O intensive utilities or are I/O intensive at times.
A disk might be able to offer throughput at 70 megabytes per second.
The file system reduces performance by half or more.
So the effective maximum throughput to and from disk
tends to be magnitudes less than RAM performance.
Therefore, tasks that are I/O intensive should run at a speed
that is appropriate for disk access and at the same time
not saturate disk I/O and deprive user process and &quot;moil&quot;
from fast acquisition of desired content from files.
The arrangement of cpu.shares and utilization of the cock utility
to mitigate disk I/O is to allow the utilities other than &quot;moil&quot;
to defer I/O to &quot;moil&quot; to defer I/O to user owned processes,
and to defer I/O to system and role specific tasks such as
web serving, mail serving, and file serving.
So yes, the utilities drive a higher loadavg,
but this does not indicate over utilization of resources.

As previously mentioned above,
&quot;moil&quot; is delegated the task of compilation.
Therefore, when compilation is complete
then &quot;moil&quot; loads the &quot;post&quot; &quot;reap&quot; &quot;save&quot; queues.
Then &quot;moil&quot; becomes available to begin processing
of the additional spells in it's queue.
Consequently, the use of additional queues and utilities
enables &quot;moil&quot; to be almost constantly compiling spells
while almost never waiting for another utility to complete it's task.
When &quot;moil&quot; is ready to begin compilation of a software project
then &quot;till&quot; has already prepared the source tree,
and &quot;rush&quot; has already prepared the ccache directory.
That allows &quot;moil&quot; to compile software
like a belt fed machine gun can fire cartridges.

As a consequence of the division of labor
instances will occur when the &quot;post&quot; queue
might have 8 to 20 spells queued
while &quot;moil&quot; is still merrily compiling.
This is normal.
The &quot;post&quot; &quot;reap&quot; &quot;save&quot; &quot;and &quot;wane&quot; queues
tend to lag behind &quot;moil.&quot;
And in contrast &quot;rush&quot; &quot;till&quot; and &quot;load&quot; queues
tend to anticipate &quot;moil.&quot;
And &quot;wand&quot; is running to help ensure that tasks are
completed prior to &quot;moil&quot; starting on a spell,
and to ensure that tasks complete after &quot;moil&quot; runs.

I apologize if I was overly verbose.
Perhaps my exuberance shows?
Running the newer sorcery is fun.
It performs less overhead than current sorcery.
It runs tasks concurrently rather than linearly with compilation.
And it is overall faster and more efficient.
Fewer processor cycles are spent on idle and wait.
Updating and deployment completes faster.

In a sense this sorcery corrects the mistakes
of  what I began and completed sloppily and ineffectively with &quot;familiar.&quot;
These changes allow sorcery to perform adequately
on single, dual, quad, 8 core and more processor machines.
Neither RAM nor processor utilization becomes excessive,
while the benefit of SMP is fully exploited.
It easily represents over 400 hours of design, implementation and testing.
Much of it was accomplished with near 16 hour a day labor.
I wanted it's completion as soon as possible so that
I can provide it on new I/Rs.
This change will enhance the speed of deployment of new boxes.
And it contains many of the changes that I waffled about,
because I tend to prefer &quot;to not fix what is not broken.&quot;
However, currently available sorcery has many flaws
that cause it to perform less than ideal on boxes
with more than 4 processors.
However, in contrast newer sorcery scales beautifully.

The codename for the newer sorcery will be sorcery-delegation-.
That is because the many tasks that were previously performed
by cast and dispel have been delegated to task specific utilities.
As a result certain aspects such as the minutes of overhead
that came after the compilation large software projects such as firefox
shrank by a magnitude and now run concurrently while &quot;moil&quot;
has already begun compiling a new spell.
This is exactly how it should be,
allowing the utilization of SMP and the assignment
of processor cycles that might otherwise become idle
or wait to accomplishing tasks such as installation
of files, creation of an archive tarball, and creation of log files.

As previously mentioned the newer grimoire and sorcery are exciting.
However, their arrival might yet remain days away.
I am pleased to share, but only after adequate testing.
Already I have had boxes compiling with the newer sorcery non-stop for days.
However, some tests are not yet complete.
I have tested the new table cloth trick,
but the final test for that is
the casting of ncurses readline
and of course glibc.

At the rate of progress newer sorcery will probably become available
during the 4th or perhaps 5th week of October
if the testing does not complete sooner.
After that I resume changing and testing the code that is used
for generating I/Rs and the deploying new boxes from I/Rs.
The newer sorcery is vastly different from current
and therefore, many changes and testing will be required
before new I/Rs are complete.
Originally, I was expecting to generate 2 more I/Rs for 2012.
However, now there will be only one more I/R for 2012.
Sorry for the delay,
however we will all agree that the wait was worthy
when we try the newer sorcery and newer I/Rs.

Again I also want to express that we all owe Evert thanks
for providing feedback, ideas, and testing on his 8 processor box.
This way we can gain certainty that
sorcery scales without racing and fork bombing.  :)
