Yeah, Patrick dropped it from Slackware around version 10.0 or something
like that for this very reason. There's GSB, I think, which tries to
stay current with the distro and Gnome, but I've never tried it.

There's also a lot of concern that KDE is going to go bonkers too, and
those issues were raised with the KDE team by some distro maintainers,
and noted too - they don't want to alienate the distros like the
arguably mis-managed Gnome has.

It's a bummer that Enlightenment is a mess, as you point out below, but
I haven't used that in years either. Even with Compiz, I had to roll
back from damages installing it caused.

I'm currently running KDE on my laptop, and Xfce (which rocks)
sometimes, but on my Sorcerer boxes I haven't ventured into
workstation-ville, being content w/my CLI based servers happily humming
along :)


&gt;<i> It requires both stable and unstable source tarballs
</I>&gt;<i> and not all of it compiles.
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the errors are focused around gobject-introspection.
</I>&gt;<i> But to not have gobject-introspection installed prevents compilation
</I>&gt;<i> of pygobject-v3 and libpeas.
</I>&gt;<i> And that blocks compilation of totem and gedit.
</I>&gt;<i> I have wasted more than a couple of days trying different combinations
</I>&gt;<i> of gnome software to see if there is yet a solution to this insane puzzle.
</I>&gt;<i> I am still at it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We really should only support one version of KDE at a time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even if KDE authors state otherwise that is exactly what KDE typically does.
</I>&gt;<i> Something such as the qmake from qt3 can not co-exist with the same name
</I>&gt;<i> in /usr/bin as the qmake from qt-everywhere-opensource.
</I>&gt;<i> And obviously, the qmake from qt3 must be used to compile KDE3.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also KDE is not multilib.
</I>&gt;<i> However a multilib installation of KDE is provided on Sorcerer,
</I>&gt;<i> because the 32-bit portions are stored in /opt/32bit a separate prefix.
</I>&gt;<i> Installing all of it into /usr does not work.
</I>&gt;<i> Bit specific version files exist with the same names.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> KDE does have ways of installing it in a home directory for the adventurous few that want to try it out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes home style installations only work in obsolete documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if anyone was interested in software installed to their home directory
</I>&gt;<i> then the zero install project might be a good method for giving software a try
</I>&gt;<i> by the use of pre-compiled binary packages installed into one's home directory
</I>&gt;<i> instead of doing a full compilation of software.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That way, when KDE 5 comes around, we can have either KDE 5 or 4 installed,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but not both.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Uncertain what we can assume about what the KDE team will do.
</I>&gt;<i> For the moment they are slowly feeding metal pineapples with the pin pulled
</I>&gt;<i> to some of their source tarballs.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, kdeutils, kdeadmin, kdeaccessibility, kdegraphics and
</I>&gt;<i> kdeedu no longer exist.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead many separate tiny tarballs exist that provide some of the
</I>&gt;<i> same programs.
</I>&gt;<i> My guess is that they are making KDE easier and faster for a
</I>&gt;<i> customized download and installation.
</I>&gt;<i> In that respect KDE is becoming a bit more like gnome.
</I>&gt;<i> However, they are not going crazy with giving every tarball a unique
</I>&gt;<i> version number
</I>&gt;<i> which is impelling my irritation at gnome.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, the KDE team is providing a similar convenience sans the
</I>&gt;<i> version insanity.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the changes make for a slightly less than trivial
</I>&gt;<i> checking/preparation of updates for me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Gnome seems ideally suited for a pre-compiled binary based distribution,
</I>&gt;<i> because I doubt if the gnome quality control team
</I>&gt;<i> does as much compilation testing of their software as I do.
</I>&gt;<i> If they could test better and coordinate their updates so that their
</I>&gt;<i> current product
</I>&gt;<i> with stable tarballs that contain bug fixes all compiles
</I>&gt;<i> then that would be impressive.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course gnome having a gnome-shell that works on all graphics
</I>&gt;<i> hardware would also be impressive.
</I>&gt;<i> Seems like gnome's quality has declined since the of the gnome 1 to
</I>&gt;<i> gnome 2 transition.
</I>&gt;<i> Back when I was complaining about them creating binary incompatible
</I>&gt;<i> versions of gtk+ 1 and 2
</I>&gt;<i> with the exact same names.
</I>&gt;<i> And of course they did that again with gtk+ version 3, which is why we
</I>&gt;<i> have a gtk+-v3 spell.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When gnome does not compile and is not usable on all graphic workstations
</I>&gt;<i> and when we can not update glibc for knowing that the update will cost
</I>&gt;<i> all NFS and RPC functionality,
</I>&gt;<i> and when x86_64 firefox mysteriously crashes on any download attempt
</I>&gt;<i> then all of that gives cause to wonder about the continued usability
</I>&gt;<i> of free software.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I fortunately discovered that only firefox 64-bit compiled
</I>&gt;<i> with gnomevfs support crashes.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, disabling gnomevfs support in firefox solves the crashing.
</I>&gt;<i> But that monkey rode on my back for more than a month.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So for the moment KDE seems good to use and gnome and enlightenment
</I>&gt;<i> seem good to avoid using.
</I>&gt;<i> And rather than making any significant progress on my todo list
</I>&gt;<i> I am shuffling around the potential version of installed software
</I>&gt;<i> looking for the mythical combination
</I>&gt;<i> of installed software that makes gnome compile.
</I>&gt;<i> If I do not have it soled by the 10th I will give the broke attribute
</I>&gt;<i> to several spells
</I>&gt;<i> that either cause problems or have problems
</I>&gt;<i> and then leave it that way for 6 months.
</I>&gt;<i> I can not be wasting weeks of Sorcerer dev time because the gnome team
</I>&gt;<i> can not put a release together properly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are a number of updates that we will be sitting on for nearly forever.
</I>&gt;<i> The new zlib causes compile failures.
</I>&gt;<i> The new xine-lib causes compile failures.
</I>&gt;<i> The new ffmpeg causes compilation failures.
</I>&gt;<i> And we have been sitting on poppler for a long time already.
</I>&gt;<i> For the most part updating such library spells is not truly a
</I>&gt;<i> distribution decision.
</I>&gt;<i> Rather we wait until software that links with those libraries can
</I>&gt;<i> handle the API changes.
</I>&gt;<i> With important libraries I do extensive testing and if doubts remain
</I>&gt;<i> then the version stays the same.
