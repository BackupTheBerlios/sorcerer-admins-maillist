<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Last week Evert introduced the topic of better git support for sorcery.

Of course my preference is for downloading source tarballs
or xz compressed sdelta3 patches created from source tarballs.
The xz compressed sdelta3 patches conserve more bandwidth
than source acquisition by rsync, xdelta patches, cvs, svn, etc...
However, at least one project, the linux-firmware project,
which I do not want to drop from the grimoire
ceased providing convenient tarballs for downloading.
Therefore, a notion for improving repository support
was not far from mind.

The previous implementation involved setting an array variable called
REPOSITORY.
And naturally, a single spell could only download from a single repository.
It was a rough and limited implementation.

However, for git support I added the changes directly into the current
implementation
and avoided the use of the REPOSITORY variable.

Copied below from the linux-firmware spell is an example of how it works.

    source stable linux-firmware-$VERSION.tar master
<A HREF="git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git">git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git</A>

What follows is an explanation of the parameters to the source() function.

The first parameter is optional except when downloading from git.
It specifies the &quot;version progress&quot;
If an explicit version progress is not specified
then the version progress is assumed to be &quot;stable.&quot;

Second parameter is optional, except for when
the tarball name is not a portion of the final parameter.
Also the second parameter can only be specified when the first
parameter was specified.
If version progress is specified
then the tarball name can be specified.
This could also be useful when downloading from a script.

The third parameter is optional except for when downloading from git.
The third parameter can only be specified when the second parameter
was specified.
The third parameter specifies a tag or branch.

The forth and final parameter is the git URL.

Easy yes?

sane-backends made a source tarball release yesterday.
It was a .tar.gz split into 3 fragments.
That seemed odd.

leech can not download fragments of a gzipped file.
leech identifies the first file fragment as a gzipped file,
checks it, discovers that the download is incomplete,
and attempts to resume the file transfer.
The server denies byte range support and the file download completes.
However, because the first file is obviously incomplete
it will not be copied into the source cache.
Therefore, update of sane-backends is impossible, yes?

Actually, sane-backends spell mitigates the difficulty
by source acquisition from git.
And here is how the source line appears:

    source stable sane-backends-$VERSION.tar RELEASE_${VERSION//./_}
<A HREF="git://git.debian.org/sane/sane-backends.git">git://git.debian.org/sane/sane-backends.git</A>

This example shows how the tag can differ from the version.
This invocation to the source function transmutes the VERSION into the tag.
Simple, yes?

And for the third example is the spell StuntRally.

    source   stable StuntRally-$VERSION.tar        $VERSION
<A HREF="git://github.com/stuntrally/stuntrally.git">git://github.com/stuntrally/stuntrally.git</A>
    source   stable StuntRally-tracks-$VERSION.tar $VERSION
<A HREF="git://github.com/stuntrally/tracks.git">git://github.com/stuntrally/tracks.git</A>

This demonstrates how a spell can have sources from two or more git
repositories.
The REPOSITORY variable lacked this functionality.

Seems as if git is becoming a popular choice for open source software
developers.
Therefore, I intend to deprecate the $REPOSITORY variable.
If anyone requires support for source acquisition from svn or cvs
then I can probably code that similar to git.
If desired then please make the request.

The above examples do git support with stable version progress.
This final example shows how git support can be easily added to a spell
as an optionally selected version progress.

   version &quot;git 3.2.y&quot;  3.2.28          3.2.27          3.2.26
    source &quot;git 3.2.y&quot;  linux-v$VERSION.tar v$VERSION
<A HREF="git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bwh/linux-3.2.y.git">git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bwh/linux-3.2.y.git</A>

Version progress can contain multiple words separated by a space
provided that they are enclosed with single or double quotes.

This final example is hypothetical since I have not tried it.
However, in theory augur can provide overrides to a spell
that allow acquisition from git even when not part of the spell definition:

# augur source git $SPELL-$VERSION.tar $TAG $REPOSITORY
# augur progress $SPELL git $VERSION

Of course the SA must substitute appropriate values from $SPELL
$VERSION $TAG $REPOSITORY
However, creating an override would be approximately that easy.

However, if the build function is not suitable for source acquired from git
then that would require the creation of a ${SPELL}-cusom type spell
that will exclusively provide the original spell by using an invocation
of the eprovides function.

The gain of this functionality seemed reasonably important
for further delay of the new Install/Rescue images.
I should have begun implementing git support
the moment that I decided to update the linux-firmware spell.
However, for just one spell
I could tolerate using the git web interface for requesting a tarball
and then uploading that tarball to the master source cache.
However, since Evert wants git support for acquisition of sources
directly from the head of repositories
to assist with debugging and reporting of errors to software developers
I decided to provide a decent implementation.

BTW, implicit inheritance of sources defined for stable version
progress is deprecated.
Therefore, alternate version progress such as unstable version progress
must also have an invocation to the source function that begins:
source unstable ...
However, implicit inheritance of sources defined for stable version progress
is provided when the selected version progress is &quot;custom.&quot;
Therefore, selecting a custom version progress such as:
# augur progress bash 4.3
will inherit the line:

    source <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/">ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/</A>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/</A> bash-${VERSION:0:3}.tar.gz

that implicitly defines the source for the stable version progress of bash.
However, the SA can also override the source by using
# augur source ...

Consequently, almost no convenience is lost
while at the same time less confusion is created concerning
whether a spell with non stable version progress inherits the sources
for the stable version progress if sources for the non stable version
progress are not defined.
And the answer is no.
Consequently, a spell such as sound-juicer,
which defines both stable and unstable version progress,
also defines both stable and unstable sources.

Therefore, if a unstable source tarball releases for a spell
exist in a separate download directory or on a separate server
then that creates no problems.

I hope this helps demystify a spells source function.
It provides a good bit of functionality for a modest amount of complexity.
Understanding of the source function depends on understanding version progress.
Therefore, if confusion still exists
then please read:
# augur help progress

The following provides additional information about version progress
and Sorcerer.

The opportunity for selecting unstable version progress
exists for nearly 500 spells.
However, by default Sorcerer spells install the sources
that are defined by stable version progress.
And most often stable version progress
acquires the most recently released source tarball
that the software author declared to be stable.
SAs can nudge that towards more development/unstable releases if the
SA so desires.

If the quality of free software tends to be good
then Sorcerer looks good.
However, the converse is also true.

The current versions of firefox leak memory.
With moderate usage
firefox can consume several gigabytes of memory.
Immune system counter measures
can automatically activate additional swap files.
On demand swap file activation prevents swap locking.
However, the swapping that firefox causes
creates I/O lag on a workstation.
Be aware that this is not &quot;Sorcerer sucks,&quot;
but rather &quot;Firefox sucks memory issue.&quot;
The solution is to periodically restart firefox
or try selecting a version progress for firefox
that was released prior to firefox becoming insatiably hungry for memory.

I do not guarantee that any of the installed software works properly.
The provided software probably has more bugs than a garden.
However, free software authors do not make guarantees
about the fitness of the software that they provide.

Ultimately, whether a deployed box works properly or not
is the sole responsibility of the SA.
If a bug exists in a spell then please report that on this email list.
If a bug exists in the source tarball and manifests as a runtime error
then please report that to that software project's email list or forum.
When I discover that a runtime bug exists
then I might attempt to circumvent that bug by presenting
a different version of the software.
That is why make version 3.82 has existed since 20100728
and yet the version provided by the make spell remains at version 3.81.
While I will try to avoid runtime errors
I typically will not try to debug runtime errors in other people's software.

Vanilla source is what Sorcerer offers.
I focus on making a decent sorcery and decent spells.
I avoid allocating time to forking free software projects
in order to provide improvements that I want.
Any spell with custom patches to provide what I want stays in my local grimoire.
The patches provided in the grimoire and
applied to specific versions of sources before compilation
are provided in order to circumvent or repair problems
that would cause an error with compilation or linking of the source.

To state that Sorcerer is a moving target is accurate.
The goal remains to deploy a box
that can be seamlessly upgraded
from past to present to future.
However, to state that Sorcerer is unstable is inaccurate.
With almost no exceptions,
Sorcerer provides the release versions of software
that software authors have declared as stable.

Hypothetically speaking, if Sorcerer was unstable
then the stable releases of thousands of software projects
must also be unstable.
And since nearly all distros are built from the same selections of
software projects
then the obvious conclusion is that nearly all distros must be unstable.
Such reasoning is confusing and inaccurate.

Both stable software and unstable software have bugs.
Unstable software is expected to have more bugs.
The presence of bugs does not make software unstable.
However, a sufficiently inconvenient bug
might be sufficient reason for making a version available
as unstable version progress rather than promoting it to stable.

A Sorcerer box is not less stable than other distros in general.
However, it might provide software that is newer than what other
distros provide.
This is because Sorcerer box automatically adapt to the changes
in the shared object names of installed ELF libraries.
And that is why Sorcerer SAs do not do a mandatory re-installation
from fresh Install/Rescue images per year or per every 2 years.
The boxes update seamlessly from past to present to future.

Because the software on Sorcerer boxes updates
nearly as fast as software projects make new releases
the provided software will differ from other distros.
Perhaps it will contain more bug fixes.
Perhaps it will contain more security fixes.
Perhaps it will contain more and newer functionality.
Nobody knows what the future brings.
However, after a decade of retrospect
I feel certain when stating that
Sorcerer boxes have a better than average chance
of surmounting the challenges of transitioning.

Historically, SAs complain when the change to a newer branch of Apache httpd
renders their customized configuration files incompatible.
Fortunately, nobody sent flame email this time.  :)
And that is good, because such a problem is not a deficiency with Sorcerer,
but rather the defined duty of the SA to upgrade and verify configuration files.
Therefore, httpd not restarting after an update is not &quot;instability.&quot;
It is a the consequence of a box lacking a SA
that is actively participating and performing the SA's role.

Words such as &quot;unstable&quot; and &quot;rapidly changing&quot;
tend to have negative connotation.
However, they are not necessarily undesirable.
Sometimes the stable release of software is ancient and no longer compiles,
and yet the unstable release can compile and be provided instead.
When that occurs then a spell's stable version progress
might refer to the software author's unstable release.
Doing so is not undesirable.
Sorcerer boxes adapt the less acknowledge desirable characteristic
of &quot;unstable&quot; and &quot;rapidly changing&quot; software
to provide SAs with a desirable outcome.

Admittedly a paradigm exists
where software is not acknowledge as stable
unless the software author released it 2 or more years ago.
Therefore, SAs with that paradigm prefer deploying distributions
that provides software that is a year or more behind
what a software author provides as a current stable release.
I am fine with that.
But it is not do-able on a Sorcerer box.
Sorcerer box can be lagged behind the current grimoire for about 3 months.
If lagged too far behind
then grimoire and sorcery tarballs will not be available for download.

I do not concur with the paradigm that ancient == stable.
The older installed software becomes
then the more likely that someone has discovered an exploitable vulnerability.
Surfing the wave of free software provides better protection
than hoping that distribution maintainers
find and back-port security patches to ancient releases.
And that is why Sorcerer is always on the leading edge of stable software.

By &quot;leading&quot; I am not implying &quot;bleeding.&quot;
Anyone who wants &quot;bleeding&quot; can select unstable version progress.
Or even better, specify a git version progress and source override
and download and compile software directly from the head of the master.

Sorcerer is not unstable.
Sorcerer is not bleeding.
Sorcerer provides the versions of software that software authors
define as stable.

Being able to install &quot;unstable software&quot; and select &quot;unstable version progress&quot;
are confusing aspects about Sorcerer.
The rapidly updating loadout of software and the amazing functionality
also gives cause for people to wonder if Sorcerer is stable.
And the answer to that question is, &quot;Yes Sorcerer is stable.&quot;
Does that mean that Sorcerer contains no bugs?
And the answer to that question is, &quot;Yes Sorcerer contains bugs.&quot;
A day would not feel complete without squishing at least one bug.
But that is a good thing.
Until computers program themselves then bugs will be unavoidable.
Therefore, better to squish them sooner rather than later.

The goal of Sorcerer remains the same.
Consequently, the addition of git support
does not imply a desire to provide installed software
that comes directly from the daily head of software authors' git repositories.
Sorcerer continues to provide the software that software authors
declared stable;
complete with all the bugs that the software authors allowed through.
Please enjoy responsibly.  :)
