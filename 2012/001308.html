<PRE>for leaving the line in udev that specified the latest
version of udev at 145 while the tested build()
is for version 146 if indeed that is the reason why
the installed udev is worthless.
On the other hand if the udev team would not
change the build method so frequently
then the probability of udev working would improve.
udev is a very critical piece of software.
Since I recognize that I keep an older udev
in /etc that I can use if the udev I am testing
completely fails me, which happens often.
However, perhaps each box should normally
have two udev installed so that a SA might
have an easier way out of the tough spot
that your box is in?

BTW the spell version progress of &quot;latest&quot; and &quot;unstable&quot;
and not guaranteed to be tested.
When there are stable versions that have problems
I usually list them in latest if they are more current
than the version specified in stable.
Therefore, specifying a version progress of latest
is not something a SA should do then forget about.

I will think more about the udev situation
and perhaps some good ideas will come to mind
about how to prevent this sort of derailment from happening.
For the moment I added a reminder to the udev spell
to not list unstable, latest, nor legacy versions in that spell.

Your box is definitely in a situation where I do not want
any box to be in.
It should only happen on my test box when testing
new versions of udev.
But at least it is not something so difficult that
one can not manually dig their way out of it.
However, if you want to boot using the I/R
and then mount the real root filesystems
that will avoid your current initramfs problem entirely.
Then you can go straight to fixing the installed udev
Probably only I would dig a box out of such a hole
without using the Install/Rescue disks.
I never use the I/R for rescue.  :)
But it is for rescue also.
And it aught to be able to entirely avoid
the initramfs problem if you can boot with the I/R CD.
You can thank Evert for requesting the nice easy rescue
menus that are available on the current I/R.
