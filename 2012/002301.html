There will be failures, if gnome components are installed.
gnome is a mess.
It requires both stable and unstable source tarballs
and not all of it compiles.
Some of the errors are focused around gobject-introspection.
But to not have gobject-introspection installed prevents compilation
of pygobject-v3 and libpeas.
And that blocks compilation of totem and gedit.
I have wasted more than a couple of days trying different combinations
of gnome software to see if there is yet a solution to this insane puzzle.
I am still at it.

&gt;<i> We really should only support one version of KDE at a time.
</I>
Even if KDE authors state otherwise that is exactly what KDE typically does.
Something such as the qmake from qt3 can not co-exist with the same name
in /usr/bin as the qmake from qt-everywhere-opensource.
And obviously, the qmake from qt3 must be used to compile KDE3.

Also KDE is not multilib.
However a multilib installation of KDE is provided on Sorcerer,
because the 32-bit portions are stored in /opt/32bit a separate prefix.
Installing all of it into /usr does not work.
Bit specific version files exist with the same names.

&gt;<i> KDE does have ways of installing it in a home directory for the adventurous few that want to try it out.
</I>
Sometimes home style installations only work in obsolete documentation.
However, if anyone was interested in software installed to their home directory
then the zero install project might be a good method for giving software a try
by the use of pre-compiled binary packages installed into one's home directory
instead of doing a full compilation of software.


&gt;<i> That way, when KDE 5 comes around, we can have either KDE 5 or 4 installed,
</I>&gt;<i> but not both.
</I>
Uncertain what we can assume about what the KDE team will do.
For the moment they are slowly feeding metal pineapples with the pin pulled
to some of their source tarballs.
Therefore, kdeutils, kdeadmin, kdeaccessibility, kdegraphics and
kdeedu no longer exist.
Instead many separate tiny tarballs exist that provide some of the
same programs.
My guess is that they are making KDE easier and faster for a
customized download and installation.
In that respect KDE is becoming a bit more like gnome.
However, they are not going crazy with giving every tarball a unique
version number
which is impelling my irritation at gnome.
Therefore, the KDE team is providing a similar convenience sans the
version insanity.
However, the changes make for a slightly less than trivial
checking/preparation of updates for me.

Gnome seems ideally suited for a pre-compiled binary based distribution,
because I doubt if the gnome quality control team
does as much compilation testing of their software as I do.
If they could test better and coordinate their updates so that their
current product
with stable tarballs that contain bug fixes all compiles
then that would be impressive.
Of course gnome having a gnome-shell that works on all graphics
hardware would also be impressive.
Seems like gnome's quality has declined since the of the gnome 1 to
gnome 2 transition.
Back when I was complaining about them creating binary incompatible
versions of gtk+ 1 and 2
with the exact same names.
And of course they did that again with gtk+ version 3, which is why we
have a gtk+-v3 spell.

When gnome does not compile and is not usable on all graphic workstations
and when we can not update glibc for knowing that the update will cost
all NFS and RPC functionality,
and when x86_64 firefox mysteriously crashes on any download attempt
then all of that gives cause to wonder about the continued usability
of free software.
However, I fortunately discovered that only firefox 64-bit compiled
with gnomevfs support crashes.
Therefore, disabling gnomevfs support in firefox solves the crashing.
But that monkey rode on my back for more than a month.

So for the moment KDE seems good to use and gnome and enlightenment
seem good to avoid using.
And rather than making any significant progress on my todo list
I am shuffling around the potential version of installed software
looking for the mythical combination
of installed software that makes gnome compile.
If I do not have it soled by the 10th I will give the broke attribute
to several spells
that either cause problems or have problems
and then leave it that way for 6 months.
I can not be wasting weeks of Sorcerer dev time because the gnome team
can not put a release together properly.

There are a number of updates that we will be sitting on for nearly forever.
The new zlib causes compile failures.
The new xine-lib causes compile failures.
The new ffmpeg causes compilation failures.
And we have been sitting on poppler for a long time already.
For the most part updating such library spells is not truly a
distribution decision.
Rather we wait until software that links with those libraries can
handle the API changes.
With important libraries I do extensive testing and if doubts remain
then the version stays the same.
