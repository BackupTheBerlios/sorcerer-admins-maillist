<PRE>as automatically on or off during boot and shutdown,
without having to cast -r the spell that installed the init-script.

Making changes on this menu correctly updates sorcery logs.
It correctly the mode on init-scripts in /etc/init.d/
It invokes /lib/lsb/install_initd to update symbolic links to
init scripts created in directories /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/
Consequently, the changes made here remain permanent across updates.

Spells such as:

glibc-locales
glibc-localtime
init-functions
favor
core

introduce new functionality or replace functionality
that used to be provided by /usr/sbin/{augur,sorcery}

These spells demonstrate that functionality
to accomplish both simple to complex tasks
can be added to Sorcerer by writing spells.
Writing spells does not add complexity to sorcery tools,
does not change sorcery tool API,
and does not risk breaking some aspect of sorcery tools.
Given those considerations recommendations that
might otherwise not make it into the sorcery tools
may qualify to be implemented as spells.


In order to ensure that Sorcerer boxes behave better
the spell init-scripts installs several init-scripts mode 0700
for automatic executing during boot that replace functionality
that used to be provided by /etc/inittab

After init-scripts installs,
boxes no longer require virtual file systems
that are currently specified in /etc/fstab

Spell init-functions installs the following scripts mode 0700
so that they properly execute as required during boot and shutdown:

/etc/init.d/dmesg         &lt;--  Writes kernel ring buffer to
/etc/init.d/log/dmesg
/etc/init.d/fsck          &lt;--  Checks filesystems specified in /etc/fstab
/etc/init.d/lock          &lt;--  Mounts tmpfs /var/lock
/etc/init.d/loglevel      &lt;--  Kernel console loglevel set to 3
/etc/init.d/mount         &lt;--  Mounts local filesystems
/etc/init.d/proc          &lt;--  Mounts proc on /proc
/etc/init.d/pts           &lt;--  Mounts devpts on /dev/pts
/etc/init.d/run           &lt;--  Mounts tmpfs on /var/run
/etc/init.d/shm           &lt;--  Mounts tmpfs on /dev/shm
/etc/init.d/sorcery       &lt;--  Mounts tmpfs on /root/.sorcery
/etc/init.d/swap          &lt;--  Activates swap
/etc/init.d/sys           &lt;--  Mounts sysfs on /sys
/etc/init.d/usb           &lt;--  Mounts usbfs on /proc/bus/usb
/etc/init.d/utmp          &lt;--  Creates proper /var/run/utmp
/etc/init.d/wtmp          &lt;--  Creates proper /var/log/wtmp

It also installs the following init-scripts as either mode 0700 or 0600
depending upon the SA's selection:

/etc/init.d/hwclock       &lt;--  Synchronizes system and CMOS clocks
/etc/init.d/tmp           &lt;--  Mounts 2G tmpfs on /tmp and
                               binds /tmp/.sorcery to /usr/src/sorcery


Consequently, a meager /etc/fstab that specifies merely
mount points for removable media, fixed disk partitions and swap
is sufficient.

Additionally, by not specifying /root/.sorcery in /etc/fstab
the distribution maintainers can set proper limits for /root/.sorcery
using the /etc/init.d/sorcery init-script.

However, if a virtual filesystem is specified in /etc/fstab
then those parameters are used for mounting the filesystem
when /etc/init.d/mount executes during /boot
This can be useful for setting a precise size for /dev/shm

By having virtual filesystems mounted by scripts
adding support for additional virtual filesystems becomes
trivial for distribution maintainers since /etc/fstab
will no longer be modified by sorcery script nor spell.


Not everyone was pleased with the way the initramfs image was constructed.
Previously, one initramfs provided a partial selection of modules expected
to be required for booting for up to 4 kernels.
It was a good compromise that saved disk space on /boot
However, that method is already history.

Now a separate initramfs image is constructed for each kernel image.
Each initramfs contains a complete set of modules for that that kernel,
yes networking modules also.
It also contains some of /etc and all of /bin /lib /lib64 /sbin.
On IA32 architecture each initramfs will be about 26M per box.
On x86_64 architecture each initramfs will be somewhat larger.

This change requires that newly deployed boxes,
with the soon to be released I/Rs,
will require /boot partitions of a size somewhere between 256M and 1G.
However, boxes with new hardware
should have no problems loading kernel and initramfs images that exist
beyond the 1024 cylinder on a fixed disk.
Therefore, those boxes do not require a dedicated /boot partition.
Because of this I am strongly considering entirely removing
the recommendation for creating /boot from the menu driven installer.

Existing Sorcerer boxes with 64M /boot
may be incompatible with the newer initramfs images
Kernel + initramfs = 27M * 4 images = 108M &gt; 64M
/boot is too small.

Naturally, I am still awaiting compilation to finish on the new x86_64 I/R.
After much consideration I decided to change from a stable linux
kernel configuration
to one that includes support for developmental and incomplete drivers.
Yes, for those SAs who requested ext4
and have deployed ext4 partitions
the new I/Rs should be able to perform
rescue operations on ext4 partitions.

The reason that tipped the balance in favor of providing a
developmental enabled kernel
was that the entirely modular construction of the kernel may avoid encountering
unfortunate bugs that exist in modules that are never loaded.
Consequently, using the developmental enabled kernel should enable
installation of Sorcerer on very new boxes for which linux contains
only developmental hardware drivers.

Lastly and most important is the change involving customized config files.
Files in /etc/init.d/ can no longer be customized.
Customization to init-scripts will be disregarded.
Customized init-scripts are overwritten when a spell cast
which installs those init-scripts which are customized.

The reason for this change is because customized init-scripts
can be cause frustrating problems
when customizations become incongruent with
the functionality expected from the new init-script.
A customized /etc/init.d/mount init-script has the potential
to stop a box from properly booting or properly mounting
filesystems during boot, for example.

In order to have non standard init-scripts installed
a spell must install those the non-standard init-script.
This could be accomplished by
copying a spell to the local grimoire and
properly adjusting the spell.

Hopefully, the afore mentioned conveniences will outweigh this
potential minor inconvenience with disallowing customized init-scripts.
It is a fair trade for avoiding the potential of a customized init-script
causing a box to malfunction during boot or shutdown.

Thanks for reading.
Happy New Year.
Hope the first week of 2008 went better than expected for everyone.
