<PRE>&gt;<i> $ startx
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Doesn't work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Demetry, we cannot help you if you give us no information. If you can
describe &quot;Doesn't work&quot; a little better, then we can help.

If the error message is: &quot;Command not found&quot; then you have not installed
Xorg yet. That can be fixed by:
cast Xorg

However, if you have managed to cast enlightenment, it probably would have
pulled in xorg as a requirement.

So, it's probably giving you a blinking cursor that times out after a while
and drops you back in the command line.

If so, then there is a /var/log/Xorg.0.log, which contains all the
information on what the X server tried to do to start.

You can read it by typing:
less /var/log/Xorg.0.log
on the command line, and pressing enter.

If you want to be fancy about it, you can type
grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log
That will separate out only the error lines in Xorg log file, and give you
a good idea of what is going wrong.

There is a lot of information in the log file, and sorting through that is
not simple.
Have a read at:
<A HREF="http://tldp.org/LDP/www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch07.en.html">http://tldp.org/LDP/www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch07.en.html</A>

I can guarantee that most of the Sorcerer SA's have read that document, and
have set up X11 manually at least once.

Good luck.

It might also be helpful if you describe your video hardware to us. Make
and model as a minimum.


&gt;<i> Oh and a forum would be good for Sorcerer Linux so that the same issues
</I>&gt;<i> won't be brought up again. It is also easier for newbies and has better
</I>&gt;<i> communication that can easily be referenced if messaged before.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Feel free to start one, and post a link to this page on the mailing list.
It may have more success than the last time we tried to have a forum. We
even had a wiki, but none of the sorcerer SA had the time to write
documentation, as we are all too busy with our normal day to day jobs.
