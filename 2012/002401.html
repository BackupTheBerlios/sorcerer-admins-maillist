*grins*
It should have copied to /aux/can/source/
If not then it might be anywhere.

&gt;<i> Lucky I have a recent backup of all the sources,

Good for that.
I am on the verge of laughing because bugs never wipe my source cache,
but almost invariably the gremlins snack on Evert's source cache.
It has a certain element of comedy by repetition.

&gt;<i> Definitely it's a little rough around the edges, and any SA doing this
</I>&gt;<i> update is recommended to have a good recent backup of everything.
</I>
As the expression &quot;worth his salt&quot; goes;
every SA that is worth his salt already has backups.
However, if immune-exam-transition merely wiped the source cache
then that is not terribly, merely inconvenient.
Wiping / would be terrible.
Those directories specified in immune-exam-transition
in the function aux_dirs() and in the function relocation()
are all hard coded rather than relying upon variables
specified in /etc/sorcery/config
I hope I can shake my wonder about where the sources landed.
The transition should have been nearly full proof unless
fowled by symbolic links or a mount --bind.

Anyway, I hope it works.
Both the distribution and services boxes are up to date.
The newer sorcery is working fine on those.
The source cache is still updating.
A certain file /root/.curlrc was missing
and curl was hanging on some downloads.
That seems odd.
However, I created the file
and it should be back on progress towards completion.

Even with as rough as this newer sorcery is;
I am expecting that it's current state is more reliable
than how I left sorcery before the revision.
More succinctly stated, it if not the better of both
then it is definitely the lesser of two evils.  :)
