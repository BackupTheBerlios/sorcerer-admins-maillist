<PRE>I don't think you realized this but you got an all for one when you chose
pidgin.

Pidgin has a lot of chat messenger clients including IRC and the main ones
such as AIM, Gtalk, Yahoo!, MSN, and even ICQ (ICQ was the first one I used,
but I don't know anyone that uses it anymore and the last time I used it was
2005.) So yeah Pidgin has IRC in it and so you can access those chat
features as well. I didn't know if you knew. So, pidgin seems to have been
a
good choice in that respect. I forgot why I didn't use it 3 years ago, but
I'll try it
out again when I get the chance.

&gt;<i> The first bug effected only those that tried installing
</I>&gt;<i> from the new I/R within 1 hour of my announcement.
</I>&gt;<i> I forgot to update the provided version of grimoire-sentient.
</I>&gt;<i> This was not a bug with the I/R, but something I forgot to do elsewhere.
</I>&gt;<i> But it is now fixed and so the new I/R will install new software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The new software provided on the I/R contains security updates for xorg,
</I>&gt;<i> KDE version 4.8.1, a recent version of firefox, and pidgin.
</I>&gt;<i> Pidgin is new to this release of &quot;Sorcerer Sentient.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> It requires an extreme amount of additional libraries,
</I>&gt;<i> but provides a very nice universal chat client that
</I>&gt;<i> is also compatible with google talk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realize that SA probably prefer IRC.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the generation that came later expect that
</I>&gt;<i> ICQ, and all similar chat protocols/programs,
</I>&gt;<i> were the first methods for chatting over the Internet,
</I>&gt;<i> because those were the methods that they first used.
</I>&gt;<i> And so that was the reason for adding pidgin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Naturally, a considerable amount of software is not provided
</I>&gt;<i> by the default &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; installation.
</I>&gt;<i> That software is still available to those who do a &quot;Sorcerer Modern
</I>&gt;<i> Magic&quot; installation
</I>&gt;<i> or who transition a box to &quot;Sorcerer Modern Magic.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; is still aimed at providing a decent selection
</I>&gt;<i> of potentially useful software to novice level computer users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These I/Rs received basic testing of the &quot;novice&quot; level installer,
</I>&gt;<i> because I made minor changes and wanted to verify that
</I>&gt;<i> I did not break anything.
</I>&gt;<i> The installer no longer creates a swap file as the first entry.
</I>&gt;<i> Boxes should have sufficient installed RAM.
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the compressed archives will require nearly 400M of RAM in
</I>&gt;<i> order to decompress.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, Sorcerer requires a box with at least 1G of RAM  installed.
</I>&gt;<i> Any less then expect failures if not major swapping.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am already considering what I want provided on the next I/R
</I>&gt;<i> and on the next &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; release.
</I>&gt;<i> Suggestions are welcome.
</I>&gt;<i> The next release is expected in 3 to 6 months from now.
</I>&gt;<i> 3 months if the software catalog looks very good at the time.
</I>&gt;<i> Or 6 months if free software looks problematic or improvements
</I>&gt;<i> and subprojects are causing reasons for delays.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The I/R and the archives provided for &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; installation
</I>&gt;<i> are a matched set.
</I>&gt;<i> Existing I/Rs are now obsolete for the purpose of installing &quot;Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> Sentient&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Whether they work properly or cause 100+ pre-installed software
</I>&gt;<i> projects to compile
</I>&gt;<i> newer versions is not known nor tested.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, anyone who wants to install, please download and use the new
</I>&gt;<i> I/Rs.
</I>&gt;<i> After much pounding I managed to compact them
</I>&gt;<i> to almost the same size as the previous I/Rs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As usual please report bugs.
</I>&gt;<i> If no serious show-stopping bugs exist
</I>&gt;<i> then immediate bug fix re-releases will not happen
</I>&gt;<i> and the next release will be considered in about 3 months.
</I>&gt;<i> And please do not assume that I am aware of a bug.
</I>&gt;<i> The I/Rs work for me which is why I was able to create
</I>&gt;<i> and provide the large set of archives for rapid deployment
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; boxes.
</I>&gt;<i> I use a qemu-kvm virtual machine for testing.
</I>&gt;<i> The experience of installing on various real hardware configurations may
</I>&gt;<i> vary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As requested I attempted to provide improvements to make the new I/R
</I>&gt;<i> more wireless network friendly.
</I>&gt;<i> wpa_supplicant daemon is started during boot.
</I>&gt;<i> It uses file /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf as it's configuration
</I>&gt;<i> file.
</I>&gt;<i> Proper modification of that file is required in order to connect to a
</I>&gt;<i> WPA encrypted network.
</I>&gt;<i> It will probably look something like below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=wpa_priv
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> network={
</I>&gt;<i> ssid=&quot;network_name&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> scan_ssid=0
</I>&gt;<i> key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
</I>&gt;<i> psk=&quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sorcerer-admins">some_Amaz1ng_P at ssworD</A>&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Modify the ssid= and psk= lines in the above example
</I>&gt;<i> will work on a WPA-PSK encrypted wireless network.
</I>&gt;<i> Restarting wpa_supplicant is easy.
</I>&gt;<i> # /etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant restart
</I>&gt;<i> Then launch dhcpcd if automatic configuration is desired.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If /etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf exists at boot and is
</I>&gt;<i> correct
</I>&gt;<i> then a automatic network configuration will probably be attempted and used.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise add a properly modified template to /etc/networks.d/
</I>&gt;<i> Documentation is in /etc/networks.d/templates/README
</I>&gt;<i> # less /etc/networks.d/templates/README
</I>&gt;<i> Basically it is a copy and modify a simple file type of configuration
</I>&gt;<i> process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any box with an ethernet cable connection to the router
</I>&gt;<i> will automatically configure it's network during boot.
</I>&gt;<i> That is both convenient and also how I test the new I/Rs.
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, the new I/Rs will provide a happy fun experience for everyone.
