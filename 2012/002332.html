</I>&gt;<i> I keep up with the news.
</I>
For some people that might be an easy task.
When I edit about a hundred spells on each update
I do not always know the reason for an update.
It might be new functionality, security, or bug fixes, for example.
Sometimes for security related fixes I visit xorg's website
where it lists which updates that fix security problems.
Additionally, sometimes freshmeat/freecode announces
which updates fix security issues.

However, if someone had very good awareness of the situation
then that person could convey it to me and
I could also properly adjust the &quot;secure version progress&quot; for such spells.
As we all know spells have potential for an unlimited amount
of version progress, but most often have &quot;stable&quot; &quot;unstable&quot;
and &quot;secure version progress.&quot;
&quot;Secure version progress&quot; is the choice that is best suited
for the SA that wants updates that fix security vulnerabilities
but in general does not want the upgrades that might introduce bugs.

The updates a software author makes may be for reasons of adding
new features and functionality which also incurs the highest potential
for introducing new bugs.
And some updates may be merely bug fix updates.
Sometimes the method which the software author changes
the version may indicate the difference.
This is evident with linux kernels, gnome software source tarballs,
and some other projects.
Although we have some potential for identifying this
and perhaps potential for putting the information to use;
discussion has not occurred on this topic yet.
Well, actually, it has, but on a spell specific basis,
such as the decision to try avoiding the
x.y.0 release of KDE or the x.y release of gcc
and then wait until the first bug fix release for the new branch.

The concept of an implementation that would
either promote stability or promote progress
would make a worth discussion.
Perhaps an implementation could allow the SA to select a preference
that would be applied in a somewhat generic manner
rather than having to specifically select version progress
for each installed spell?

Spells in the grimoire currently favor progression to newer stable releases.
I only hold back or regress the promotion of a new version
for a spell at a rate of about maybe 1 in 1000 updates.
The last recall was yanking the installed version of cmake
from 2.8.8 back to 2.8.4.
Yes, they made 4 less than satisfactory releases.
And while speaking of *make,
the make spell seems forever stuck at version 3.81,
but the 3.82 version seems to have bugs involving parallel make
which has limited and tested always tested in advance use
for software compilation on Sorcerer.
Spells allowed to do parallel make have the makej attribute.
And that is currently 1217 spells.
Please forgive the digression.

I created version progress so that SAs could gain easy access
to installation of alternate release branches of software.
And for most software projects
that release more than merely a stable source tarball
those spells also have &quot;unstable version progress&quot;
which I update when I see new versions appear.
I do this frequently for software hosted on GNOME's ftp server.

Version progress also helped eliminate disinformation
concerning whether Sorcerer was providing unstable software.
And the answer to that became YES,
but only when the SA selects &quot;unstable version progress&quot; for a spell.

&gt;<i> They stopped supporting it 2 years ago and
</I>&gt;<i> only want money now and only for Windows.
</I>
I know a few alternatives.
Any suggestions for clients that are
not chatzilla or not already in the grimoire?

&gt;<i> I've had to find alternative IRC instead.
</I>
I am hoping that someone has already been there and done that.
I do not do IRC sufficiently to recognize which software
has favorable features/functionality/appearance, etc...
IRC may be in my bag of tricks, but is not my niche expertise.

&gt;<i> I used to go out searching for new programs all the time and try out a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of programs.
</I>
Sorcerer SAs would benefit
if that sort of information could be funneled
into development of spells for desirable quality software.

&gt;<i> Right now I cannot install Sorcerer. It is not working properly enough and I
</I>&gt;<i> have already reinstalled several times with the same results of just a black
</I>&gt;<i> screen with a blinking cursor as a result.
</I>
And if pressing enter, then does it present a prompt to login?
If so then that is not too far from ideal.
Install KDE on it and it will gain a GUI login.

On the other hand, some kernel graphics modules
that have kernel mode switching capability
will entirely and permanently blank the screen when loaded.
The following modules are blacklisted in files located in /etc/modprobe.d/
ch7006, i915, nouveau, radeon, vmwgfx

If the hardware exists at boot and udev is coldplug loading
the module and it is problematic then the person at keyboard
will likely never reach a prompt for selecting installation type.
Therefore, this problem seems unlikely.
But if anyone knows of additional modules that should be blacklisted
then please convey.
BTW, blacklisting modules prevents udev from loading them,
however the X server can still load them.
Therefore, blacklisting graphics related modulesis not usually problematic,
but I only blacklist what I know causes problems
rather than blacklisting all graphics modules.

&gt;<i> You are telling me to fix the installation issue
</I>&gt;<i> and this will take a long while for me.
</I>
Giving a verbose description of the problem might
solicit insightful replies on the email list.
Not to seem cruel but if the problem with the I/R
is located between the chair and keyboard
then typically a new I/R release
will not solve nor circumvent that problem.

However, if the problem exists in on the CD
then it might be fixed by burning a new ISO9660 image.
I always recommend that a SA test the quality of the burn
by doing a md5sum of the device containing the I/R
and comparing it with the md5sum file.
Or it can be dd(ed) back to a file and both files can be compared.
Currently, the I/R does not contain code to detect
and report physical media errors.
But the small size of the I/R helps mitigate the probability.

If the problem is distribution wide,
which means it could effect all boxes of similar hardware loadout
then identifying and circumventing this problem
would be the best course of action prior to generating new I/Rs.
A good example of this is when earlier versions of I/Rs
had a difficulty that only manifest
when the computer had a floppy disk drive attached.
Strange is it not?
I adjusted some init-scripts, rolled a newer I/R
and the problem was solved.
There was also at least 2 other methods that a SA could have
locally solved or circumvented the problem.
Therefore, it was an annoying, but not an insurmountable, problem.

Other distros release I/R CDs or floppies that are entirely unusable
and then do not admit the fault nor even provide fixes for more than a week.
In contrast when I release a new I/R
I tend to do 3 days of relaxation in front of the keyboard
so that I can receive and respond to errors
and if necessary re-commence the release cycle.
I have yet to do a new release and
then rush out on a 1 week long vacation.
But if I did then I would certainly announce
it and probably place that release in a beta/ directory
to indicate the quality is not known beyond my testing.


&gt;<i> I am trying to find a recording desktop software
</I>&gt;<i> and then once I can do that then I can show you.
</I>
<A HREF="http://www.linuxhaxor.net/5-ways-to-screencast-your-linux-desktop/">http://www.linuxhaxor.net/5-ways-to-screencast-your-linux-desktop/</A>

At least xvidcap is in the grimoire,
but the other 4 I have yet to try.

&gt;<i> good to keep up on the news instead of being behind by a few years.
</I>
Until today nobody repeatedly jeered my ignorance of free software projects.
I am surprised.
In contrast to most distros selection of available software
Sorcerer's selection is often the more current.

Obviously, while my two eyeballs are trained on 3000+ moving targets
I do not always allocate time to locate and read all the fine print.
I admit that I do not read the Changelogs for every source tarball
when I updating spells in the grimoire.
However, I definitely do read and grep most
if not every file inside of a source tarball when a problem exists
and that software project is important and must be fixed.

Just about every patch file and every sed statement in the grimoire
that was crafted to fix a compilation/link error I wrote.
So where I seem to neglect discovering some information
I put that time to good use by identifying problems
and adding fixes to spells so that software
continues to be compilable and usable on Sorcerer.
That makes me more of a do-er than a newser.

And I might have known about the state of xchat, but I tend to be forgetful.
If I knew about xchat I would have likely forgot about it.
Some projects discontinue releases for a couple of years
and then suddenly spark back to life.
I see this when I am changing the
info last line in a spell from 2010.... to 201207..
If both a website/homepage and spell exists
then I intend to visit it periodically to check for updates.

Help and information is always appreciated.
Yet please do not expect me to be omnipotent.
I also am cut from the same stone as most any Sorcerer SA.
And we all have our different strengths and areas of expertise.
Mine happens to be pushing a mountain of work forward,
while deciding what to allow to slide in order to allow time for sleep.

Picking at my faults is nearly endless task.
Yes I am not a news-er.
More so than anyone else,
Evert probably knows that the best way to
direct my attention to investigating and fixing a problem
is to inform me about it and then inform me again
a day or two later if the problem persists.
That is because I can both forget about
or allocate too low a priority to a tasks.
Yet in general I rarely fail to provide what I promise.
But if I did then I probably would just forget I did.  :)  *chuckles*

Rather than target practice at my faults
having people with compensating expertise
participating in Sorcerer development would be beneficial.
Sorcerer could benefit from people who are good with:
information acquisition;
drawing/visual art creation;
system administration;
niche specialization.

Niche specialization would be something like how Evert contributes
his experience and expertise concerning digital motion video production.
Without his input and feedback;
Sorcerer's selection of spells and quality
would likely be insufficient for role of a video toaster.
Yet thanks to Evert the role is solid and performance stable.

A considerable time ago,
Bob contributed expertise for both HAM radio software
and also documentation creation.
Consequently, Sorcerer gained spells for HAM radio and
Morse Code software which I might have never discovered.

I expect Jan or someone contributed some astronomy
related software and libraries,
some with builds more complex than I know how to maintain/upgrade.
And also contributed some spells for hibernation related software.

Often spell submissions are accepted when
I have no grasp of the function or usefulness of the software
and especially so if the software is related to a SAs' niche of expertise.
When someone with niche expertise becomes interested
in improving the quality of niche related software
then Sorcerer bounds ahead in those areas.
Conversely Sorcerer lacks spells for software for many niches
where Sorcerer SAs with a compelling interest in that area do not exist.

As I mentioned earlier in this email,
more news-ers would be welcome addition.
Perhaps even with the current limitations
of the &quot;version progress&quot; implementation
the available software released can be shaped to assist SAs
with creating a loadout of software that best suits their desire.

For example, I recently upgraded boost.
The new boost seems usable and compiles and installs fine.
However, some software projects require an older version of boost
and do not compile with the newer boost.
Therefore, a few spells that were otherwise fine before the upgrade
have since gained the &quot;broke&quot; attribute.
I am &quot;on the wall&quot; about this upgrade.
If I can pound the sources into usable shape to make
them compile and link with an older version of boost in /opt
then the problems creating by the boost upgrade can be ignored.
However, that was not accomplished on a first attempt.
I intend to make a second and more lengthy attempt at it eventually.

This type of upgrade demonstrates a condition
where opinions about the optimal course of action differ.
With boost as a noteworthy exception;
I can usually make such upgrades go smoothly
by providing a spell that installs an older version of software in /opt.
I anticipated a successful outcome with usual methods,
but have yet to achieve it.
This less than ideal upgrade outcome
could create cause for some SAs to prefer
that boost remain at the previously installed version.

To achieve that a SA would have to issue a command such as:
# au progress boost custom 1_46_1
Or maybe it was version 1_45_0 ?
I must check a snapshot log to know.
Likewise for the SA to make the change
requires some awareness of not only which version of boost to prefer,
but also which spells will no longer be broke,
when boost is at the lower version.

SAs might want for a method that is less mentally tasking
where such a decision could be made automatically
based upon the SA providing a previously stated preference
for currently released software or stability.

Opinions, please?

I would have immediately regressed the version of boost
if the upgrade impeded compilation of KDE.
However, the boost upgrade breaks seems to only involve
software projects for a few amusing games such as Battle for Wesnoth.
So this time neither the forces of good nor evil can prevail
while victory is boosted away.  :)
See the slang definition of boost on
<A HREF="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/boost">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/boost</A>
to aid comprehension of the joke.
