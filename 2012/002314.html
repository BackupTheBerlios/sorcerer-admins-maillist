<PRE>I think it was gaim. And yes I knew it wasn't working all the way
and is why I had to use something else a couple of years ago.

I have mostly used xchat because it's easy, but maybe there are
alternatives now that may be easy? There are many out there,
but may have a learning curve. Firefox has Chatzilla for IRC.
<A HREF="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/</A>

I do research when I can and try out what I can. I haven't figured out
Chatzilla all the way but I know some that have used it.

I haven't played with IRC bots yet but I've looked into it.

</I>&gt;<i> Additionally firefox probably has a downloadable plugin for IRC.
</I>&gt;<i> So that is at least two methods that those with &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> can participate in IRC without using a website to IRC CGI portal.
</I>&gt;<i> And playing games with IRC bots can be amusing or educational
</I>&gt;<i> provided that one has sufficient time.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pidgin has a lot of chat messenger clients including IRC and the main
</I>&gt;<i> ones
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; such as AIM, Gtalk, Yahoo!, MSN, and even ICQ (ICQ was the first one I
</I>&gt;<i> used,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but I don't know anyone that uses it anymore and the last time I used it
</I>&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2005.) So yeah Pidgin has IRC in it and so you can access those chat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; features as well. I didn't know if you knew. So, pidgin seems to have
</I>&gt;<i> been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; good choice in that respect. I forgot why I didn't use it 3 years ago,
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'll try it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out again when I get the chance.
