<PRE>Apparently, all the required software is already installed.
I read:

<A HREF="http://wiki.oz9aec.net/index.php/High_quality_screen_capture_with_Ffmpeg">http://wiki.oz9aec.net/index.php/High_quality_screen_capture_with_Ffmpeg</A>
<A HREF="http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html">http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html</A>

Thankfully, 3 year old non compiling front end fluff
that requires obsolete deprecated libraries
are not required.
I should have surmised as much.
I could make a front end in bash,
but I would probably do fine by reading the output of
$ ffmpeg --help
since it installs no manual pages.

Perhaps for the next set of I/Rs
I will upload completed test videos to youtube.
Or upload a video of victory obtained by attrition in campaigns from Wesnoth.
Not a promise, just something I am considering.

BTW, the reference to Wesnoth is an attempt at humor by repetition.
But while on the subject of it,
I fixed the problem with wesnoth compilation yesterday and a few other
spells also.
Fixes will arrive in the next UTC 00:00 grimoire
and then be available on most boxes 24 hours after that.

Ah, I should mention that because Evert reported an unexpected
hang with booting the I/R in a qemu virtual machine
that I spent some time this morning testing the x86_64 I/R
from earlier this month.
I closed the virtual machine while it was extracting files from the archives.
That was sufficient far enough along for me to expect that I had surpassed
any error or hang that happens during the boot of it.

Since I am not suffering any problem with it
my best guess might be that other people are having difficulty
with the selecting parameters for the virtual machine
or that I accidentally compiled software on the I/R with CPU specific
instructions.
Perhaps it only works on my architecture?
Seems unlikely.
If anyone feels like giving it a test or reporting that they achieved success
with the April I/R then please do so along with the CPU installed upon.

I do not intend to rush new I/R generation unless current I/Rs are unusable.
For the moment my todo list has plenty on it that I want to accomplish before
generating new I/Rs.
One of those things is to re-implement code to verify the content of the I/R
is properly intact since I do not know if SAs are properly verifying their
burned CDs using md5sum, dd, or cmp prior to attempting to use them
for installation on bare metal.
Additionally, sometimes a CD burned in one drive
might not read flawlessly in a different CD drive.
While unexpected I have seen it happen.

A mandatory CD integrity check will make installation slower,
but not by much since most boxes should encounter no difficulty
with caching about 200M of bytes from the CD.
I am pondering now whether to make it an init-script
or part of the menu driven installer.
If I waffle yet again on this
then only maple syrup will be necessary
to complete my breakfast
since I already quaffed a glass of orange juice.  :)

P.S.
Everyone actually checks their burned CDs before booting
them to verify integrity yes?
Transferring content to a USB SSD and
making it bootable is also a viable choice.
And a USB SSD will likely eliminate
almost all possibility of a read/write error.
The I/R does not mind being on USB SSD instead of CDROM.
The only requirement is that the device be recognized as removable.
