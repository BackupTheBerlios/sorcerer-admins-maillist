<PRE>&quot;So I might not appear to be doing much.
But rather I am attempting to limit how much I do.  :)&quot;

Sounds good. I think I understand that. At least there's progress.

My system is a dual core with 8GB of ram. That way I could have
at least 2 modern operating systems at the same time. (Linux Mint
+ WIndows 7 (Virtual Box) or Linux Mint + Sorcerer (qemu)

I know that not everything works within virtualbox with WIndows 7
such as it not picking up everything from a CD/DVD into VirtualBox
Would there be any way in the future (or maybe it happens already)
that Sorcerer could work all the way in qemu?

Looking forward to what comes next from Sorcerer.

My time is limited right now but after mid-August I will have more time
to help or eventually work my way into helping out.

Thank you,
Demetri Salamander

&gt;<i> Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i> I added additional code to sorcery

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am upgrading some of the libraries that gcc uses.
</I>&gt;<i> And I am doing a standard update of spells for new versions of source
</I>&gt;<i> tarballs
</I>&gt;<i> that my Internet mining programs discovered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I want to have the newer software on the next I/R release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I did not announce it on the list previously
</I>&gt;<i> but I added a limiter to cast which should help wrangle
</I>&gt;<i> the loadavg without creating idle cycles.
</I>&gt;<i> It does not monitor the loadavg and so if something else
</I>&gt;<i> is creating high load in addition to cast
</I>&gt;<i> then the loadavg might still be more than 1 over processing cores.
</I>&gt;<i> However, normally it maintains a loadavg of nearly processing cores or 1
</I>&gt;<i> more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That will be useful for SAs that want to run sorcery on 8+ processing
</I>&gt;<i> unit SMP boxes,
</I>&gt;<i> but do not want to enable feature min in order to avoid the potential
</I>&gt;<i> worst case scenario
</I>&gt;<i> of reaching a 128 loadavg.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt it could actually happen even without the limiters.
</I>&gt;<i> Worst case loadavg created entirely by cast
</I>&gt;<i> on a quad core x86_64 is theoretically 32.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet I never observed it surpassing loadavg 16.
</I>&gt;<i> Ideal loadavg would be approximately 5
</I>&gt;<i> which is what the limiter is designed to achieve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason to dread high loadavg is not because of wasted CPU cycles
</I>&gt;<i> during task swapping,
</I>&gt;<i> but rather due to increased memory consumption when the loadavg is not
</I>&gt;<i> caused
</I>&gt;<i> by disk I/O
</I>&gt;<i> And even excessive swapping causing disk I/O is undesirable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The amount of sources that would use an excessive amount of RAM during
</I>&gt;<i> compilation
</I>&gt;<i> and especially during linking has increased in recent years which is why
</I>&gt;<i> sometime in the previous year I quit providing an init-script to mount
</I>&gt;<i> tmpfs on /usr/src/sorcery/
</I>&gt;<i> File fragmentation and some loss of speed is preferred over creating
</I>&gt;<i> I/O caused by swapping.
</I>&gt;<i> The use of tmpfs was a good idea during the years when computers
</I>&gt;<i> tended to be over-built,
</I>&gt;<i> or having more RAM and CPU than required.
</I>&gt;<i> However, software authors have adjusted to that trend and again
</I>&gt;<i> pre-made computers
</I>&gt;<i> tend to be under-built and unsuitable for Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> A Sorcerer box should have at least 2G of RAM and at least 1G of RAM
</I>&gt;<i> per processing core.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, a quad core box with 3G of RAM installed would be under-built.
</I>&gt;<i> A quad core box with 4G of RAM installed would suffice.
</I>&gt;<i> And a quad core box with 8G of RAM installed would be advantageous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I digress.
</I>&gt;<i> My point was that the sorcery tools are designed to use as much power
</I>&gt;<i> as the box can provide when the &quot;min&quot; feature is not enabled.
</I>&gt;<i> And the limiter aspects helps prevent resource overuse.
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone might wonder why resource overuse would be a problem
</I>&gt;<i> then that is because cast does something that other source managers
</I>&gt;<i> might not do.
</I>&gt;<i> cast does multiple make when possible,
</I>&gt;<i> multiple concurrent ELF 32-bit and ELF 64-bit compilation when possible,
</I>&gt;<i> and multiple concurrent compilation of several spells when possible.
</I>&gt;<i> Succinctly, if cast detects that the box can handle more
</I>&gt;<i> then cast will give the box more to handle.
</I>&gt;<i> In contrast other source managers might be able to do one of the above,
</I>&gt;<i> or maybe 2 of the above, but not all 4.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, not knowing when compilation of a source will contribute
</I>&gt;<i> a loadavg of 1 or a loadavg of 4 on a quad core box
</I>&gt;<i> becomes an uncertain factor that the limiters mitigate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4 spells concurrently casting, both ELF 32-bit and ELF 64-bit versions,
</I>&gt;<i> with 4 parallel make enabled on each has potential for creating:
</I>&gt;<i> 4 * 2 * 4 = 32 loadavg.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the limiters should help keep that closer to 5 instead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The limiters are not present on the current I/Rs.
</I>&gt;<i> The new code will be available on newer I/Rs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I might not appear to be doing much.
</I>&gt;<i> But rather I am attempting to limit how much I do.  :)
