Evert was correct that detailed report including exact error message and logs
are required when further assistance is desired.
That is because many command problems that can be anticipated
are already circumvented with Sorcerer.
startx failing would likely be a box specific error rather than a
distribution wide problem.
Therefore, such a problem must be solved at the box specific level
based upon the SA's knowledge, skill, and any 3rd party assistance
that can be acquired
from email lists, forums, news groups, FAQs, HowTOs, manual pages,
google searches, etc...
Since the log files usually contain either excellent clues or the exact reason
then those are the place to start.
Almost any SA who has been using X11 long enough
has experienced a moment when the X server would not start.

&gt;<i> I need to learn everything about Sorcerer before learning bigger projects like wayland.
</I>
Ambitious.  Even I do not know everything about the software that is
installed by Sorcerer.
However, some areas I have more specialization and skill with than others.
If becoming involved with wayland development
then understanding how X works and it's protocol could be useful.
Having experiencing writing X apps might also be useful.
However, that all might also be unnecessary.
Best way to discover is by asking the people already involved with
wayland development.

However, if I was a new programmer wanting to assist with open source
development
then I might want to become involved with the coreutils developers.
coreutils is a collection of relatively small and simple utilities
used by shell scripts
and SAs when at a command line.
In some cases coreutils provides functionality such as sort and uniq.
Yet other programs such as rm rmdir mkdir
act as sophisticated wrappers for glibc file system functions.
They allow the shell to perform those commands.

Over a decade ago someone showed me something called an OSI chart
that explained an operating system as 7 layers.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model</A>
This is conceptually useful for neophytes that do not yet recognize
the interconnectedness.
However, the model is not useful for veterans that see and realize the
connections.

The majority of software acts as units that partially process and
translate information for a separate layer.
For example wayland can act as a layer that sits between the X server
and the kernel.
And in general the processing that wayland does makes X output slower
than allowing X to communicate directly with the kernel.
And the kernel provides and controls access to hardware.
Not everyone would agree, but programming tends to become easier
the further removed it is from interacting with hardware.

kernel &lt;-&gt; glibc &lt;-&gt; coreutils &lt;-&gt; bash

That is where coreutils is situated.
And if the aforementioned hypothesis is true
then kernel hacking is very challenging,
glibc hacking is moderately challenging,
coreutils programming is an average challenge,
and bash programming is easy.
However, exceptions to every rule exist.
In my experience shell programming is very different
than assembly, C, C++, Pascal, perl, PHP, Fortran, etc...
Consequently, mastery of shell programming is not easily acquired.
And master does not mean that one is capable of writing shell scripts,
but rather that the shell scripts created run incredibly fast.
It is the main reason why most people except that shell programs
will run extremely slow when compared to an implementation in any
other language.

If accepting the OSI model as gospel truth
then reconciling linux becomes difficult
since it exists at multiple layers.
However, choosing participation at an easy level in order to gain experience
can be more useful than diving into the deep end with a &quot;sink or swim attitude.&quot;

&gt;<i> I'm looking into game development as a degree and then I would need to learn
</I>&gt;<i> more about server administration.
</I>
Seems like it could be even more lucrative than running an online casino.
People seem very happy to exchange real money for virtual items.
The house always wins with online gaming.
However, that might be a big corporation that fleeces both the
customers and the workers.
The pay might not be commensurate with the amount of learning and
training required.


&gt;<i> Thanks for telling me more about wayland.
</I>
The benefit of experience allows for a different interpretation of
what was written at the homepage.
I can see how the goals are to make it a software layer
that will not necessarily replace X
at least not in the near future.
However, what begins as something that is potentially superfluous
can evolve into something that becomes an essential component such as udev.
Sorcerer's existence pre-dates the udev project,
and Sorcerer might have been one of the first projects to use devfs
instead of a traditional /dev on disk file system.
However, in these days few people might want to run a box without the
benefit of udev.
I would go as far as to say that
I perceive udev as being a near essential utility for using a modular kernel.
The evolution of the udev project slowly eroded my resistance towards
modular kernels.
For many of Sorcerer's earlier years; Sorcerer was a distribution
intended to be run
with a monolithic kernel and to boot without initramfs images.
Anyway, my point is that wayland might have a bright future
or it might become something like DirectFB.
Retrospect is required.

&gt;<i> I need to learn to be a hard core
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer Admin and also cast works.
</I>&gt;<i> I casted enlightenment.
</I>
cast is among the odd English words that lack a separate conjugation
for past tense.
To say &quot;I cast enlightenment.&quot; is interpreted as an action that
already happened.
Although conjugation of Nihongo verbs work only 3 ways
I tend to also find myself doing google searches
in order to gain absolute certainty.
Please feel no shame for learning that cast has no separate form for
past tense conjugation.

Sorcerer is much like any other distribution but with fewer fluffy GUI
configuration tools.
Consequently, SAs must read the documentation
such as manual pages and the files provided in /usr/share/tldp/
/usr/doc/ /usr/share/doc/ /usr/src/linux/Documentation/
also contain fascinating reading.
Perhaps the challenge is not acquiring the information
but narrowing the searching and learning to immediately relevant information.

Hmm, I just now noticed
/usr/src/linux/tldp/XFree86-Second-Mouse
Never considered the possibility previously,
but hmm I have unopened mice boxes in my hardware reserve.  :)
What could I do with two mice?
Perhaps I rather attach a tablet device, for drawing?
Anyway, with all that documentation; becoming distracted is easy.
Almost nobody will read all of it.
Anyone who tries will probably gain a spinning headache
and spend a few hours comatose.  :)

&gt;<i> OUYA is coming out in March 2013. It will be using Android OS and will be
</I>&gt;<i> completely hackable. Gaming will soon evolve for Linux.
</I>
Some people will probably enjoy being able to program their own phones
and mobile devices.
And access to free software should be completely better than an app store.
If I ever decided to buy one of those mobile gadgets
then I might also create a Sorcerer port for it
provided that the device has sufficient RAM and mass storage.
If it has embedded limitations then I will forget about it.

Being able to run open source voice over IP telephone programs on a
mobile cell phone
might not only be desirable for the advantage of being able to
voice/video conference,
but also for what it could save on international long distance calls
to cell phone.
Only because my sister insisted; I tried skype on linux.
Both the ELF and statically linked versions of skype segmentation
fault and crash.
They were both entirely unusable.
I am not a fan of voice over IP using proprietary protocols.

&gt;<i> I can tell you more later. I need to figure out X now.
</I>
The manual pages and the documentation provided by the linux
documentation project
would be the first place that I would start looking.

&gt;<i> Oh and a forum would be good for Sorcerer Linux so that the same issues
</I>&gt;<i> won't be brought up again. It is also easier for newbies and has better
</I>&gt;<i> communication that can easily be referenced if messaged before.
</I>
Actually, Sorcerer probably has a wiki and forum somewhere.
I seem to remember that a forum exists at the berlios project page,
but I do not actually look at it.
Perhaps I am too lazy?
Email lists seem more convenient than forums.
And the fast bug fixes introduced into Sorcerer
quickly renders distribution wide problems ancient history.

A problem involving startx would instead be a box specific problem.
The reason would typically involve something that the SA did or did not do
such as failure to read the manual page and create the proper
files in one's home directory with proper mode and content.
startx might have worked fine and then immediately exited
because X had no reason to remain running.
I apologize if the response seems harsh,
but based upon receiving no error message and no logs;
then I would surmise that startx worked perfectly
and the account running startx lacked the user created files
in the home directory that would cause a window manager
and other fun programs to run.

I knew someone with a near eidetic memory..
Of course he read every document a minimum of 8 times.
I do not.
However, I have no hesitation about re-reading documentation
when something I try achieves an undesired outcome.
Good luck on the next try.  :)
