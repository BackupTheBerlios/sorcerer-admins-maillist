Speaking of stability.

So, will we try gcc 4.4.0 again sometime in the future?

Hi there, Kyle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just for your info, I am re-compiling on my laptop =
at the moment. 32 bit on Core2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;600 spells compiled flawlessly so fa=
r, 200 to go, no failures. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;mc for some reason cannot download it&amp;#3=
9;s newest source, but compiled fine on the last one. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;in ffmpeg opts I still need to remove --enable-libswscale to have it co=
mpile. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About eglibc and Debian... well, eglibc wants to stay bi=
nary and source compatible with glibc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From what I have read so far=
, it&#39;s mainly the maintainer of glibc refusing to accept patches and ge=
nerally being not a nice person that is causing this split. Debian have not=
 gone over yet, as far as I know, but since they do submit a huge bunch of =
patches to get it to work, eglibc might just be a lot easier to handle and =
compile once all the patches have been applied upstream. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;From the glibc spell I can see that it is no simple task to get glibc t=
o compile &amp; install. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote cla=
