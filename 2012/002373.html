<PRE>Please pardon if I previously announced this.
I discovered that linux kernel parameter rdinit=/bin/bash
was problematic when the keyboard was attached by USB.
Therefore, I created support for a new linux kernel parameter called &quot;bash&quot;
The end result will achieve a bash prompt instead of doing the normal
execution of sysinit followed by runlevel.
However, that would be typically loaded will be loaded.
This way the USB keyboard will function.
Additionally, the loading of modules is accomplished with udev.
Therefore, parameter &quot;bash&quot; can be used to debug problems involving udev.

Since systemd development annexed udev; I am not above expecting
instability with releases that is tantamount to the udev of the past
back when I tended to check in versions of udev that ended in 0 or 5
in order to mitigate the amount of time
that I allocated to the task of compensating for udev changes and bugs.
Although systemd is now installed on all Sorcerer boxes,
only the udev portion of it is used.
Sorcerer boxes do not boot with systemd
although systemd wastes space on the initramfs.
After systemd reaches maturity I will re-evaluate it's potential
for replacing sysvinit for booting Sorcerer boxes.
However, I do not intend to concern myself with it this year.

Okay, so here is the summary:
Want to debug a boot problem?
Keep pressing tab and supplying the boot password.
Eventually, extlinux will present the command line used to boot
which will include both linux kernel parameters and bootloader parameters
such as the names of the initrf files that will load.
Onto the last add a space followed by the word bash
The end result will load modules
and give the person at keyboard a root bash prompt running as PID = 1.
After modifications/fixes are complete
then normal booting can be accomplished by:
# exec /init

If a serious problem exists in an init-script that will run during sysinit
then I typically fix the problem by booting this way, editing the init script
and then passing control to /init to allow the box to boot normally.
Then I make the necessary adjustments on the real root file system,
and might immediately request that new initramfs be regenerated with
# /etc/init.d/initramfs stop
The initramfs generation init-script tends to run during shutdown and by cast.
Therefore, it expects the parameter &quot;stop&quot;
But it does not stop anything.  :)
initramfs are properly regenerated during a proper shutdown/reboot.
However, if the box reset or lost power then a problem on an initramfs image
persists into the next boot if the initramfs was not regenerated.

Every Sorcerer SA already knows  that Sorcerer boxes boot with
multiple initramfs images.
That much is evident while watching the bootloader's output.
One initramfs is kernel specific and contains modules.
Others correspond to parts of the file system such as /etc /bin /lib
/lib64 /sbin
This expedites initramfs regeneration by only regenerating an initramfs
where files in the corresponding section of the file system were
modified/updated.

I added the additional information about initramfs.
Since initramfs regeneration is entirely automatic
then such information might be of no use to a typical Sorcerer SA.
Boot problems involving sysinit are exceptionally rare.
However, the possibility exists.
Therefore, good for every SA to know how to debug sysinit if necessary.

BTW, the linux version 3.5.2 kernel does not link on an Athlon-XP
without a patch
and then when booting linux version 3.5.2 on an Athlon-XP the box consistently
locked during udevtrigger.  The typical 1.5m timeout never released the box.
The keyboard's LEDs would not respond to cap locks being pressed nor numlock.
My solution for this problem was to use the bootloader menu
in order to select an older label to boot.
However, as a consequence of the experience I am shying away from
kernels version 3.3 and above
and returning linux's &quot;stable version progress&quot; to the 3.2.x series of kernels.

New features exists in the later branches of linux that I want to use
and explore.
However, those must yet wait perhaps until 2013.
Those that dare to use the newer linux can select version progress for
the additional branches.
# augur progress linux 3.5.x
The above command selects the 3.5.x version progress for linux
and would make available linux version 3.5.2 and an appropriate
configuration file.
Only the version progress defined in the spell is supported.

2.6.27.x
2.6.30.x
2.6.32.x
2.6.34.x
2.6.35.x
2.6.36.1
2.6.36.x
2.6.37.x
2.6.38.x
2.6.39.x
3.0.x
3.1.x
3.2.x
3.3.x
3.4.x
3.5.x

Anything else I have not created config files for.
And anything 2.6.y.x might be worth avoiding.
I have not examined their config files in ages.
Version progress 3.2.x seems like a champion at the moment.
It will currently provide linux-3.2.27.tar.xz as it's source.
27 bug fixes releases helps create confidence that it should work as expected.
However, in the future when newer linux branches are ripe for harvest
then the linux spell will change.
However, that evaluation might not be considered and tested again
until early 2013.
