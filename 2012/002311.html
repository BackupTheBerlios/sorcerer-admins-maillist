<PRE>The first bug effected only those that tried installing
from the new I/R within 1 hour of my announcement.
I forgot to update the provided version of grimoire-sentient.
This was not a bug with the I/R, but something I forgot to do elsewhere.
But it is now fixed and so the new I/R will install new software.

The new software provided on the I/R contains security updates for xorg,
KDE version 4.8.1, a recent version of firefox, and pidgin.
Pidgin is new to this release of &quot;Sorcerer Sentient.&quot;
It requires an extreme amount of additional libraries,
but provides a very nice universal chat client that
is also compatible with google talk.

I realize that SA probably prefer IRC.
However, the generation that came later expect that
ICQ, and all similar chat protocols/programs,
were the first methods for chatting over the Internet,
because those were the methods that they first used.
And so that was the reason for adding pidgin.

Naturally, a considerable amount of software is not provided
by the default &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; installation.
That software is still available to those who do a &quot;Sorcerer Modern
Magic&quot; installation
or who transition a box to &quot;Sorcerer Modern Magic.&quot;
&quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; is still aimed at providing a decent selection
of potentially useful software to novice level computer users.

These I/Rs received basic testing of the &quot;novice&quot; level installer,
because I made minor changes and wanted to verify that
I did not break anything.
The installer no longer creates a swap file as the first entry.
Boxes should have sufficient installed RAM.
Some of the compressed archives will require nearly 400M of RAM in
order to decompress.
Therefore, Sorcerer requires a box with at least 1G of RAM  installed.
Any less then expect failures if not major swapping.

I am already considering what I want provided on the next I/R
and on the next &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; release.
Suggestions are welcome.
The next release is expected in 3 to 6 months from now.
3 months if the software catalog looks very good at the time.
Or 6 months if free software looks problematic or improvements
and subprojects are causing reasons for delays.

The I/R and the archives provided for &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; installation
are a matched set.
Existing I/Rs are now obsolete for the purpose of installing &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot;
Whether they work properly or cause 100+ pre-installed software
projects to compile
newer versions is not known nor tested.
Therefore, anyone who wants to install, please download and use the new I/Rs.
After much pounding I managed to compact them
to almost the same size as the previous I/Rs.

As usual please report bugs.
If no serious show-stopping bugs exist
then immediate bug fix re-releases will not happen
and the next release will be considered in about 3 months.
And please do not assume that I am aware of a bug.
The I/Rs work for me which is why I was able to create
and provide the large set of archives for rapid deployment
of &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; boxes.
I use a qemu-kvm virtual machine for testing.
The experience of installing on various real hardware configurations may vary.

As requested I attempted to provide improvements to make the new I/R
more wireless network friendly.
wpa_supplicant daemon is started during boot.
It uses file /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf as it's configuration file.
Proper modification of that file is required in order to connect to a
WPA encrypted network.
It will probably look something like below.


ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=wpa_priv

network={
ssid=&quot;network_name&quot;
scan_ssid=0
key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
psk=&quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sorcerer-admins">some_Amaz1ng_P at ssworD</A>&quot;
}


Modify the ssid= and psk= lines in the above example
will work on a WPA-PSK encrypted wireless network.
Restarting wpa_supplicant is easy.
# /etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant restart
Then launch dhcpcd if automatic configuration is desired.

If /etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf exists at boot and is correct
then a automatic network configuration will probably be attempted and used.
Otherwise add a properly modified template to /etc/networks.d/
Documentation is in /etc/networks.d/templates/README
# less /etc/networks.d/templates/README
Basically it is a copy and modify a simple file type of configuration process.

Any box with an ethernet cable connection to the router
will automatically configure it's network during boot.
That is both convenient and also how I test the new I/Rs.
Good luck.
Hopefully, the new I/Rs will provide a happy fun experience for everyone.
