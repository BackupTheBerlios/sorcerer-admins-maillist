<PRE>       Instead of giving the device explicitly, one may indicate the (ext2  or
       xfs)  filesystem that is to be mounted by its UUID or volume label (cf.
       e2label(8) or  xfs_admin(8)),  writing  LABEL=&lt;label&gt;  or  UUID=&lt;uuid&gt;,
       e.g.,   `LABEL=Boot'   or  `UUID=3e6be9de-8139-11d1-9106-a43f08d823a6'.
       This will make the system more robust: adding or removing a  SCSI  disk
       changes the disk device name but not the filesystem volume label.

Lables may not be unique on a box, but should be.
UUIDs are unique, unless a partition is copied using dd.
Lables may give important clues about what a partition is for.
UUIDs are only useful if one happens to remember a part of
the sequence belongs to a certain partition.

With the added complexity of LVM2's volume groups I did not want
to add UUID and label complexity to the Sorcerer installer.
However, to go with USB we will have to use UUID,
because UUIDs are supposed to be unique while labels might not be unique.

Here is an example of /etc/fstab with a UUID:

UUID=7408b91f-ebf1-4be0-a1cb-eb6094ceafdf /boot ext2 defaults,noatime 0 1

Yes that is just as long as it looks.

Here is an example of a UUID used in /etc/lilo.conf

boot = /dev/disk/by-uuid/7408b91f-ebf1-4be0-a1cb-eb6094ceafdf

Using a combination like above for /boot guarantees that
lilo always installs to the boot block of the correct boot partition.
There is probably a more eloquent way to do it,
but this way works fine.


syslinux provides some information about USB flash drives.

The proper mode to boot a USB key drive in is &quot;USB-HDD&quot;.  That is the
ONLY mode in which the C/H/S geometry encoded on the disk itself
doesn't have to match what the BIOS thinks it is.  Since geometry on
USB drives is completely arbitrary, and can vary from BIOS to BIOS,
this is the only mode which will work in general.

Some BIOSes have been reported (in particular, certain versions of the
Award BIOS) that cannot boot USB keys in &quot;USB-HDD&quot; mode.  This is a
very serious BIOS bug, but it is unfortunately rather typical of the
kind of quality we're seeing out of major BIOS vendors these days.  On
these BIOSes, you're generally stuck booting them in USB-ZIP mode.

THIS MEANS THE FILESYSTEM IMAGE ON THE DISK HAS TO HAVE A CORRECT
ZIPDRIVE-COMPATIBLE GEOMETRY.

A standard zipdrive (both the 100 MB and the 250 MB varieties) have a
&quot;geometry&quot; of 64 heads, 32 sectors, and are partitioned devices with a
single partition 4 (unlike most other media of this type which uses
partition 1.)  The 100 MB variety has 96 cylinders, and the 250 MB
variety has 239 cylinders; but any number of cylinders will do as
appropriate for the size device you have.  For example, if your device
reports when inserted into a Linux system:


For initial testing I transformed the geometry to zipdrive
and used partition 4 for /boot and partition 1 for /

However, using partition 1 for /boot and 2 for / will probably work fine.
If Jan's idea about lifespan holds true perhaps even having a dedicated
swap partition on the USB stick is not necessarily a bad move
if the computer is not expected to already have 2G of installed RAM.

I wonder if broke BIOS already have firmware updates to fix
flash drive booting to avoid the necessity of zipdisk geometry?

Therefore, based upon current information
I will add UUID support to the menu driven installer.
Then we can lay out new installations of Sorcerer
on USB memory sticks as easily as we would install to fixed disk.
The only bane would be those long cryptic UUIDs in /etc/fstab and /etc/lilo.

What we still require is someone to do the research to
identify the best makes of USB sticks for deploying Sorcerer upon,
with consideration for liespan, performance, ease of connecting, price, etc...
Considering the many makers it is no small task to gather the information.
I recommend limiting the search and evaluation to size 32G and larger.
Any volunteers for the task?
