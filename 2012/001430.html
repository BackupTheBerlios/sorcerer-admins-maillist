<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>to my todo list about how I aught to change the menu driven installer
in order to create a greater probability of a successful installation.
So your feedback will be of great help to future Sorcerer SAs.
Sorcerer might never become a noob friendly distro,
because the price for wielding so much power
is of course the knowledge and skill required to do so.
However, Sorcerer still has a long evolution ahead towards
achieving better between the power / knowledge requirement ration.
If that ratio is now 1/1 then in the future 100/1 would be even better.
A means to that end, to shifting it in that direction
is to improve the usability of the menu driven installer.

Currently, the menu driven installer is a bit like a skill check.
In the past it definitely was a skill check.
It required the SA to complete a successful make menuconfig
on a linux kernel.
To be blunt most experienced SAs
were unable to pass the skill check.
They would manage to install it,
but be unable to boot it
because they did something like:
forgetting to compile drivers for their fixed disk;
making those fixed disk drivers modular instead of compiled in;
forgetting to compile the filesystems they used for installing;
forgetting to make those filesystems compiled in;
or for other reasons;

Today's menu driven installer is much much much easier.
Sorcerer comes with a pre-compiled modular kernel.
And upon updates of boxes the modular kernel is
configured automatically and compiled.
So the SA is no longer troubled to have the skills that
are required in order to have a custom linux kernel.
This was a HUGE skill check.
And now it is gone.

The fact that the menu driven installer has no apparent bugs
and works, yet it is not a successful experience for everyone
is an indication that it is still a skill check.
It is the gate that bars the entry of some SAs.
Yet, it is not the intention of Sorcerer designers to prohibit
anyone from using the distro.
So having such a high, thick iron gate at the front
is not intentional, but it is a a consequence of how
the menu driven installer is designed.

The menu driven installer is designed to grant SAs
nearly all the freedom that a SA would have doing a manual install,
yet with the convenience of not having to type those commands.
To an experienced SAs the menu driven installer is like
several trails of bread crumbs.
The SA must only decide which bread the SA likes best
and then follow that trail.
But those trails are invisible to noob SAs
that are unfamiliar with what is required in order to install a distro.
This is something that was not given consideration
when the menu driven installer was created.
The main consideration for the menu driven installer
is whether it will allow senior level SAs to do what senior
level SAs would want to do during an installation.
And yes, it can do LUKS encryption, LVM2, software raids, etc...
So it seems like a success.
But it is also a successful portcullis, unfortunately.

If someone continues trying
then they will definitely achieve success with the installer.
But I can not know if the experience of Sorcerer for a noob
is any better than would be their experience using a distro
that is designed for noobs.
One should not make the premature conclusion that all
distros are as difficult to install as Sorcerer.
Distros that are designed for noobs should be easier to install.
There are even &quot;Live CD&quot; distros that can be booted from CD
and used without having to install to a fixed disk.
Each type of distro has different strengths and weaknesses.

Sorcerer is very far away from the center or norm for distros.
Sorcerer caters very heavily to senior level SAs' requirements,
needs and feedback.
Sorcerer has all the classic strengths and weaknesses
of a true pure source based distro.
Sorcerer is not like a hybrid distro that tries to be a blend
of a package and source based distro.
For people who are happy with the advantages of Sorcerer
and not bothered by the disadvantages
then Sorcerer is an excellent and yes even fun tool!
But for a noob I would imagine that Sorcerer is probably
closer to a reoccurring nightmare,
or at least one bucket of cold sweat.
That is not to imply that Sorcerer is lame.
Sorcerer is merely awesome for what Sorcerer was designed to do.

I hope you decide to continue trying and
achieve success with installing and deploying Sorcerer.
I am told that by SAs that using Sorcerer for 2 months
is a more educational experience than using a package
based distro for 2 years.
Actually, the person who last told me it gave a name of
the distro he used before and said 2 weeks instead of 2 months,
but I do not want to to brag about Sorcerer
nor put down any specific distro.

Each distro is basically like a tool.
Some are like flat head screw driver.
Others are like a hammer.
Selecting the right tool for a task tends
to achieve easy and desirable success.
Yes, using a hammer to drive screws into a wall is a possibility.
But one would not expect ideal results from the effort.
Likewise driving a nail into a wall using a screw driver is possible.
However, clearly that is a task best suited for a hammer.

The 3 factors that merge and form success are:
1. SA skill
2. Distro design
3. Role of the box.

Clearly when the SA has great skill
then skill is the most important factor.
It also tends to be the limiting factor as
to what distros the SA can select and deploy.
Also there are some distros that are designed
to do only one task such as to be deployed as a firewall.
Using a role specific distro for a role specific task
tends to produce good results for that task
while usually requiring minimal effort and skill.

Clearly SA skill is the most important factor,
especially when a senior level SA is retrospecting.
The limits of what can be accomplished using
the sorcery tools is proportional to the SA's skill,
especially the SA's skill with shell commands and shell scripting.

The design of the sorcery tools are a modular set of building blocks.
And a SA is like a young person fitting the building blocks together
in order to create something amusing and interesting.
The building blocks themselves look unassuming
and uninteresting when in a pile and when not fitted together.
The skill of the person putting the pieces together
determines the grandeur of the final composition.
And Sorcerer is very much like that.

For example...
Let us say that a SA is curious to know what
10 installed software projects are consuming the most disk space.
There is no single command to accomplish this.
However, it can be assessed very quickly.

# augur installed | augur size | sort -gr | head -n 10

augur installed: that outputs a list of installed spells

augur size: reads from stdin a list of spells
     and outputs the kilobytes totals for installed files by that spell

sort -gr: sorts input numerical and
     then reverses the sort to output highest values first.

head -n 10: prints the first 10 lines.

Putting commands together like that is simple for a senior level SA.
It is no different than stacking together some building blocks.
And now it looks like something cool and useful.  :)

This is an example that demonstrates that
the ease at which sorcery can be wielded
to achieve results and provide information
is proportional to SA skill.
To a new SA sorcery is probably somewhat confusing
and perhaps not very interesting.
But then again so were building blocks
when I first saw them.
At best I could make only a rectangular house.
Not until many years later did someone show me
how something that looked like a spaceship could
be created from the building blocks.

Sorry for the long explanation.
But I hope it shows how sorcery and Sorcerer
can be and can become a positive experience for a SA
that has the tenacity required to become a senior level SA.
Starting with something easier is possible.
However, eventually, it will probably lead a SA
back to something like Sorcerer eventually.

My apology if that insinuates Sorcerer SAs are
elite, snobbish, power mongers.
To the contrary they are nice, helpful, and capable.
Half of the time they tend to supply answers to
to their own technical support questions.
Even I enjoy receiving bug reports along with solutions.
That is great for me since it saves me time and effort.

Being a Sorcerer SA is both a great experience and
also a bit like a badge of honor because to join us
requires a rare combination of tenacity and/or skill.
And yes, what one lacks in skill can be compensated
with raw tenacity.
Merely, trying all the paths that do not work eventually
will lead a person to the path of success.
I forget what the name for that is called.
Success through perseverance perhaps?

Making mistakes is not bad.
Even by making a mistake one learns that
is not an optimal method for achieving the desired result.
So please grant yourself patience
and enjoy the process of learning it
even when making mistakes.

To create the very first bootable Sorcerer I/R
I did not copy nor look at what any other distro was doing.
Instead I did some web searching to discover what software
could be used as a bootloader on CDROM.
I selected a few to try.
Even upon deciding which one I wanted to use
I did not achieve immediate success.
Instead I spent nearly 5 days teaching myself how
to successfully create a bootable CDROM image.
Not everything comes immediately and easy.
Even the current sorcery tools
are a product of a decade's worth
of use and feedback from SAs.
It did not become awesome overnight.
And the first rough drafts of the tools were
little more than a technology demonstration
that provided that source based management was possible.
Unfortunately, most of the original design
and original implementation had to be discarded
due to short-sightedness and critical design flaws.
That does seem to imply that it was a failure,
but I prefer to think of it as a stepping stone on
the path towards success.

Sometimes success is closer than it might seem.
But it can only be achieved by those with sufficient tenacity.

The reason for that digression is to demonstrate
that the high skill required in order to wield sorcery
and install Sorcerer can be achieved through tenacity.
Like many things in life,
one can not fail at trying to becoming a Sorcerer SA
unless one decides to quit trying.
Personally, I feel that way about the Japanese language.
Learning Japanese for an English speaker is very difficult.
But as long as I do not quit trying
then I have not yet failed.

Tenacity is not merely that which separates senior level SAs
from regular SAs, but also what separates most normal people
from occupations like software engineer that require tenacity.
I have met people that totally lack tenacity.
They give into the slightest frustration
and throw temper-tantrums.
I feel sorry for those people because they move
even simple tasks into the realm of impossibility.
But that is a digression I do not want to continue to follow.

Rather instead because you decided upon Sorcerer
you are likely a person who has the required tenacity.
In spite of what anyone might say to encourage you
or discourage you, please remain confident in yourself.
Remember the fable of &quot;the tortoise and the hare.&quot;
Even if slow moving,
that which continues to push forward will eventually succeed,
while those who have natural talent but lack tenacity
will probably snooze and lose.
