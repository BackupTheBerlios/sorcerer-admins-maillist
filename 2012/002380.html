</I>
Apparently, wayland can not replace Xorg.
It is not a drop in replacement, not a compatible set of API,
but instead a simplified API that combines a window manager,
compositor and protocol.
The docs suggest that X can be made to display through wayland at a
performance cost.
However, programs that are clients of an X server expect to interact
with an X server
and wayland is not an X server an does not speak that protocol.
The most accurate description of wayland
might be something like an alternative implementation of DirectFB on 'roids.
linux-fusion is the program that makes possible running multiple
clients on DirectFB.
However, my impression of DirectFB + linux-fusion is that the goal is
less ambitious than wayland.

Many programs use a widget library rather than communicate directly with X.
Therefore, widget libraries such as gtk+ and qt-everywhere-opensource could
gain a backend for wayland.
And if so then such programs could output directly to wayland instead
going through an X server.
However, decades of software exist that is specific to X.
And wayland's OpenGL is not yet complete and can not link with libGL
without having to supporting the X protocol which is not what the
wayland project wants.
Therefore, for reasons such as that wayland will can not deprecate X.
So for the moment using wayland would achieve slower rendering.

Using wayland would be somewhat like using KDE,
but being unable to turn off the compositor that creates
the glowing blue boarders around windows and other effects.
Compositing seems to be a word that means
using OpenGL for rendering everything,
instead of using the traditional fast 2D methods.
Compositing is one of those ideas where someone thought,
&quot;Oh I can do this,&quot; but probably forgot to ask, &quot;Should it be done?&quot;

Calling wayland a widget or graphic toolkit would be inaccurate.
However, it has a similar goal of providing convenience to the client
and simplifying the complexity that is required by X clients.
The protocol, which is a fancy word for language, is expected to
be easier to learn and program than X.
And that might be a good thing.
Wayland's future could be secured if they developed an X protocol to
wayland wrapper API
sort of like how wine allows running win32 software on linux.
That could help eliminate some of the slowness that would be incurred by running
xorg with an Xserver that outputs to wayland.

<A HREF="http://wayland.freedesktop.org/xserver.html">http://wayland.freedesktop.org/xserver.html</A>
that shows a method that might work for allowing the X server to
output through wayland.
However, it requires versions of software fresh from repositories and
the application of 3rd party patches.
This is an invitation for instability.
Furthermore if it works then it adds additional complexity
and performance degradation to the X experience
that is beyond what is desired on most desktops.

For the moment adding support for wayland
would be like tossing our sabots into the machine.
And we do not want to sabotage Sorcerer.
However, &quot;Sorcerer Sabotage,&quot; sounds like a cool name
next to &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; and &quot;Sorcerer Modern Magic.&quot;

The wayland project authors have an ambitious goal.
It is not without merit.
However, it might not gain a strong foothold.
DirectFB for example has been around for a long time,
but might only be considered a preferred method
running select graphic programs on embedded systems.
For example a program that links with gtk+
can use a gtk+ that is compiled for use with DirectFB
and the outcome is that the program can be run on DirectFB instead of X11.
I have done and tested this before.
DirectFB is not nearly as experimental as wayland.

Wayland might have a fair chance at supplanting DirectFB,
after considerable more development and patch integration
into the vanilla sources for Xorg and possibly major graphic toolkit libraries
such as gtk+ and qt-everywhere-opensource.
But that is not much of a foothold.
However, X is rather difficult to escape.

Thanks for mentioning the wayland project.
I hope they have achieve success and gain a larger foothold than DirectX.
However, personally, I might not want to use wayland.
I run KDE without compositing enabled.
I prefer performance over being able to have windows mapped to the face
of a 3D cube and the other fanciness that compositing can achieve.

For the moment using xorg would require a considerable duplication of
xorg spells
with an install prefix outside of /usr so that an X for use with wayland
can be started independently of an X that is stable and unpatched.
If I had the time and curiosity then I might feel tempted to try it.
But I do not have the time to spare for the sub project.

Demetri Salamander might want to give it a try.
However, I would estimate the task to be overly challenging for a novice.
The challenge of being able to start the X server on a box should be
surmounted first.
And it can be started from a shell prompt with
$ startx &amp; exit
Reading the manual page for startx
describes exactly which files to edit in one's home directory
for a window manager to automatically start.
And startx is installed by the spell xinit.
Good luck with that.
