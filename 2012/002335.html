<PRE>Come to think of it...
With Evert's description I imagined
how the screen looks when KDE or GNOME crashes or fails to start X.
Often that results in the active virtual console lacking a getty.
That is because Xorg will always start on a virtual console
where a getty is not present.
So for the sake of argument let us assume that
xorg is crashing and the virtual console is #8.
Not much to do on a virtual console without a getty.
So I would press ctrl-alt-f1 or just alt-f1 in order to
switch to virtual console #1.
Connected to virtual machine through a vnc client
I would switch virtual consoles
by using alt-left-arrow-key or alt-right-arrow-key.
There I could log in and explore the problem.
I would definitely want to read
# dmesg
and the file /var/log/Xorg.0.log
And probably also the system log.

All of my boxes have an /etc/X11/xorg.conf
Xorg is supposed to run fine without.
But that maybe that is the exception rather than the norm.
So I would probably execute
# man Xorg
Worth reading all of it.
reading
# man xorg.conf
is also worthy.
Then I would start xorg with the parameter to probe for hardware
and write a configuration file.
Then I would edit the configuration file and copy it to the proper location.
Finally, I would execute a command such as
# ( /etc/init.d/kdm stop; sleep 5; /etc/init.d/kdm start ) &amp; exit

Then I could see if that solved the problem and provides the KDM login GUI.
For detailed instructions please read the manual pages,
since I also do not memorize that information, but merely read it as required.
Configuring Xorg for a box is a one-time event, sort of like networking.
So I spend between 1 and 5 minutes on the task and then am done.
And if all else fails try reading
# man vesa
and configuring the driver for vesa.
The VESA compatible extensions on most cards can provide
nearly full access to the resolution and color depth a card
is capable of at a small cost in reduced speed.
Video drivers for native are faster, but vesa often works.
Additionally, some cards have a kernel component a DRM module
that can be loaded.
Some can be accessed adequately through the Linux Frame Buffer.
In some respects that is similar to VESA, but it differs.
Read
# man fbdev
for information about how to modify xorg.conf to use it.

Native driver, vesa, or fbdev are the 3 methods that can normally
be used for some, but perhaps not all video cards.
Plenty of native drivers exist and the one to select is based upon the chipset.
Since nearly every xf86-video-* driver is installed on a Sorcerer box
xorg can typically auto-probe and select the proper native driver.
If it fails at that, then it typically selects vesa.
Use of the frame buffer device is typically available to both those
that have the hardware and know to configure xorg to use it.
If configured with the driver then xorg will automatically load the module.
However, xorg will not automatically load any of the modules
associated with the linux frame buffer for probing in order to
automatically create an xorg.conf configuration file.

Probably such modules are available in
/lib/modules/$( uname -r )/kernel/drivers/video/
More important is the description of which module does what.
That can be viewed by running make menuconfig
in /usr/src/linux provided that a linux kernel was compiled
and installed by
# au begin linux
or an update of installed linux.

Aside from the help descriptions available when creating a kernel configuration
I do not know where else those modules are verbosely listed.

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_framebuffer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_framebuffer</A>
<A HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Framebuffer-HOWTO/">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Framebuffer-HOWTO/</A>

Unfortunately, that seems less than comprehensive.
I recommend untarring a linux source tarball somewhere on /tmp
and running make menuconfig and finding the drivers and reading
the help descriptions.

My ignorance is probably too great for my opinion to be worthy,
but I have rarely had an interest in using frame buffer as opposed
to the native chipset or vesa driver for xorg.
However, the frame buffer device presents some interesting options
for those who want to do graphics without the benefit of running an X server.
The combination of linux-fusion and DirectFB can make for some nifty output.
In many years prior, maybe even nearly a decade,
a method existed to do svga/vga output without X.
It was perhaps earlier versions of a frame buffer or something
slightly different.
My recollection does not recall the necessity of loading a module to use it.
Maybe it involved a library such as libsvga?

X is considered bulky, even more so with a window manager,
and far more so with a desktop environment such as KDE.
Therefore, the concept of programs with
nearly direct access to the frame buffer
from a reasonable sized library
was probably of interest to those wanting to build embedded systems
and gadgets that have limited capabilities and limited RAM and ROM space.

Is using the frame buffer faster and better than native chipset xorg drivers?
In the past it was not so.
Whether it is still so I do not know.
Therefore, try first with an xorg native chipset driver.
And Evert was &quot;right-on&quot; for suggesting identifying the graphics
chipset using output from
# lspci -v
If that fails then try the vesa driver.

If that fails then one could always burn ample luck or hours
trying to make xorg work with the linux frame buffer.
Might work in 5 minutes, or require 5 hours of effort.
And it might require no more effort than modifying just
one line in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
But I do not know, since years have elapsed since I last tried.

The good aspect about creating an xorg.conf file is
that almost no reasonably recent SVGA monitor
requires mode lines in the configuration file.
I do not know who else remembers reading monitor documentation
and the back of monitors in order to create proper mode lines for XFree86.
It was something of a problem back in early days.
And setting a mode that was impossible to accomplish
had the possibility of destroying some monitors
or detonating/frying important monitor components.
So what I wrote about creating an xorg.conf file above
might seem complicated,
but today is way easier than a decade or more ago.

BTW, if the problem of booting to a KDE GUI persists,
because xorg crashes
then the way to boot the box without going into runlevel 4 or 5,
which launches the login GUI,
is to boot into runlevel 3.
And that is easily accomplished.
Just give 3 as an additional parameter to the linux.

When the countdown displays during booting,
press down arrow
then select the label to boot
press tab to receive a boot password prompt.
If the password is correctly entered
then the kernel's command line parameters are displayed.
Now press space and add &quot;3&quot;
Type 3 without the double quotes and press enter.
And just like that the box will boot into run level 3.

The default run level can be changed by editing file
/etc/inittab

That might seem advanced or esoteric,
but one gains an idea of how those things work after reading:
linux kernel documentation;
extlinux from the syslinux project documentation;
and the manual page for inittab.
Perhaps everyone eventually reads those.
They are both useful and somewhat fascinating.
Or at the very least I find
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
to be fascinating.

Historically, BIOS would perform a check of RAM on every boot.
Back in the 1980-90s period this check could be set to fast
or a rather slow several minute test.
I do not know if modern BIOS will do this.
However, the kernel for example supports the memtest parameter
which the kernel-parameters.txt file explains
I have yet to try it.
But if I had doubts about instability and segmentation faulting
being caused by faulty RAM
then I would probably want to give this a try.
Other possibilities would be slightly lowering the drive speed of the RAM,
or slightly increasing the the voltage to the RAM.
Some BIOS/CMOS configuration programs permit that and others do not.
Replacing faulty RAM is always the best choice.
However, linux might be able to spot and circumvent regions of bad memory.
Nifty things such as the memtest parameter
can be learned from reading files in
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/
