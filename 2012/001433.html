<PRE>to my todo list about how I aught to change the menu driven installer&lt;br&gt;
in order to create a greater probability of a successful installation.&lt;br&gt;
So your feedback will be of great help to future Sorcerer SAs.&lt;br&gt;
Sorcerer might never become a noob friendly distro,&lt;br&gt;
because the price for wielding so much power&lt;br&gt;
is of course the knowledge and skill required to do so.&lt;br&gt;
However, Sorcerer still has a long evolution ahead towards&lt;br&gt;
achieving better between the power / knowledge requirement ration.&lt;br&gt;
If that ratio is now 1/1 then in the future 100/1 would be even better.&lt;br&gt;
A means to that end, to shifting it in that direction&lt;br&gt;
is to improve the usability of the menu driven installer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Currently, the menu driven installer is a bit like a skill check.&lt;br&gt;
In the past it definitely was a skill check.&lt;br&gt;
It required the SA to complete a successful make menuconfig&lt;br&gt;
on a linux kernel.&lt;br&gt;
To be blunt most experienced SAs&lt;br&gt;
were unable to pass the skill check.&lt;br&gt;
They would manage to install it,&lt;br&gt;
but be unable to boot it&lt;br&gt;
because they did something like:&lt;br&gt;
forgetting to compile drivers for their fixed disk;&lt;br&gt;
making those fixed disk drivers modular instead of compiled in;&lt;br&gt;
forgetting to compile the filesystems they used for installing;&lt;br&gt;
forgetting to make those filesystems compiled in;&lt;br&gt;
or for other reasons;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Today&#39;s menu driven installer is much much much easier.&lt;br&gt;
Sorcerer comes with a pre-compiled modular kernel.&lt;br&gt;
And upon updates of boxes the modular kernel is&lt;br&gt;
configured automatically and compiled.&lt;br&gt;
So the SA is no longer troubled to have the skills that&lt;br&gt;
are required in order to have a custom linux kernel.&lt;br&gt;
This was a HUGE skill check.&lt;br&gt;
And now it is gone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The fact that the menu driven installer has no apparent bugs&lt;br&gt;
and works, yet it is not a successful experience for everyone&lt;br&gt;
is an indication that it is still a skill check.&lt;br&gt;
It is the gate that bars the entry of some SAs.&lt;br&gt;
Yet, it is not the intention of Sorcerer designers to prohibit&lt;br&gt;
anyone from using the distro.&lt;br&gt;
So having such a high, thick iron gate at the front&lt;br&gt;
is not intentional, but it is a a consequence of how&lt;br&gt;
the menu driven installer is designed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The menu driven installer is designed to grant SAs&lt;br&gt;
nearly all the freedom that a SA would have doing a manual install,&lt;br&gt;
yet with the convenience of not having to type those commands.&lt;br&gt;
To an experienced SAs the menu driven installer is like&lt;br&gt;
several trails of bread crumbs.&lt;br&gt;
The SA must only decide which bread the SA likes best&lt;br&gt;
and then follow that trail.&lt;br&gt;
But those trails are invisible to noob SAs&lt;br&gt;
that are unfamiliar with what is required in order to install a distro.&lt;br&gt;
This is something that was not given consideration&lt;br&gt;
when the menu driven installer was created.&lt;br&gt;
The main consideration for the menu driven installer&lt;br&gt;
is whether it will allow senior level SAs to do what senior&lt;br&gt;
level SAs would want to do during an installation.&lt;br&gt;
And yes, it can do LUKS encryption, LVM2, software raids, etc...&lt;br&gt;
So it seems like a success.&lt;br&gt;
But it is also a successful portcullis, unfortunately.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If someone continues trying&lt;br&gt;
then they will definitely achieve success with the installer.&lt;br&gt;
But I can not know if the experience of Sorcerer for a noob&lt;br&gt;
is any better than would be their experience using a distro&lt;br&gt;
that is designed for noobs.&lt;br&gt;
One should not make the premature conclusion that all&lt;br&gt;
distros are as difficult to install as Sorcerer.&lt;br&gt;
Distros that are designed for noobs should be easier to install.&lt;br&gt;
There are even &quot;Live CD&quot; distros that can be booted from CD&lt;br&gt;
and used without having to install to a fixed disk.&lt;br&gt;
Each type of distro has different strengths and weaknesses.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Sorcerer is very far away from the center or norm for distros.&lt;br&gt;
Sorcerer caters very heavily to senior level SAs&#39; requirements,&lt;br&gt;
needs and feedback.&lt;br&gt;
Sorcerer has all the classic strengths and weaknesses&lt;br&gt;
of a true pure source based distro.&lt;br&gt;
Sorcerer is not like a hybrid distro that tries to be a blend&lt;br&gt;
of a package and source based distro.&lt;br&gt;
For people who are happy with the advantages of Sorcerer&lt;br&gt;
and not bothered by the disadvantages&lt;br&gt;
then Sorcerer is an excellent and yes even fun tool!&lt;br&gt;
But for a noob I would imagine that Sorcerer is probably&lt;br&gt;
closer to a reoccurring nightmare,&lt;br&gt;
or at least one bucket of cold sweat.&lt;br&gt;
That is not to imply that Sorcerer is lame.&lt;br&gt;
Sorcerer is merely awesome for what Sorcerer was designed to do.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I hope you decide to continue trying and&lt;br&gt;
achieve success with installing and deploying Sorcerer.&lt;br&gt;
I am told that by SAs that using Sorcerer for 2 months&lt;br&gt;
is a more educational experience than using a package&lt;br&gt;
based distro for 2 years.&lt;br&gt;
Actually, the person who last told me it gave a name of&lt;br&gt;
the distro he used before and said 2 weeks instead of 2 months,&lt;br&gt;
but I do not want to to brag about Sorcerer&lt;br&gt;
nor put down any specific distro.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Each distro is basically like a tool.&lt;br&gt;
Some are like flat head screw driver.&lt;br&gt;
Others are like a hammer.&lt;br&gt;
Selecting the right tool for a task tends&lt;br&gt;
to achieve easy and desirable success.&lt;br&gt;
Yes, using a hammer to drive screws into a wall is a possibility.&lt;br&gt;
But one would not expect ideal results from the effort.&lt;br&gt;
Likewise driving a nail into a wall using a screw driver is possible.&lt;br&gt;
However, clearly that is a task best suited for a hammer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The 3 factors that merge and form success are:&lt;br&gt;
1. SA skill&lt;br&gt;
2. Distro design&lt;br&gt;
3. Role of the box.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Clearly when the SA has great skill&lt;br&gt;
then skill is the most important factor.&lt;br&gt;
It also tends to be the limiting factor as&lt;br&gt;
to what distros the SA can select and deploy.&lt;br&gt;
Also there are some distros that are designed&lt;br&gt;
to do only one task such as to be deployed as a firewall.&lt;br&gt;
Using a role specific distro for a role specific task&lt;br&gt;
tends to produce good results for that task&lt;br&gt;
while usually requiring minimal effort and skill.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Clearly SA skill is the most important factor,&lt;br&gt;
especially when a senior level SA is retrospecting.&lt;br&gt;
The limits of what can be accomplished using&lt;br&gt;
the sorcery tools is proportional to the SA&#39;s skill,&lt;br&gt;
especially the SA&#39;s skill with shell commands and shell scripting.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The design of the sorcery tools are a modular set of building blocks.&lt;br&gt;
And a SA is like a young person fitting the building blocks together&lt;br&gt;
in order to create something amusing and interesting.&lt;br&gt;
The building blocks themselves look unassuming&lt;br&gt;
and uninteresting when in a pile and when not fitted together.&lt;br&gt;
The skill of the person putting the pieces together&lt;br&gt;
determines the grandeur of the final composition.&lt;br&gt;
And Sorcerer is very much like that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For example...&lt;br&gt;
Let us say that a SA is curious to know what&lt;br&gt;
10 installed software projects are consuming the most disk space.&lt;br&gt;
There is no single command to accomplish this.&lt;br&gt;
However, it can be assessed very quickly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
# augur installed | augur size | sort -gr | head -n 10&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
augur installed: that outputs a list of installed spells&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
augur size: reads from stdin a list of spells&lt;br&gt;
 =A0 =A0 and outputs the kilobytes totals for installed files by that spell=
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
sort -gr: sorts input numerical and&lt;br&gt;
 =A0 =A0 then reverses the sort to output highest values first.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
head -n 10: prints the first 10 lines.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Putting commands together like that is simple for a senior level SA.&lt;br&gt;
It is no different than stacking together some building blocks.&lt;br&gt;
And now it looks like something cool and useful. =A0:)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is an example that demonstrates that&lt;br&gt;
the ease at which sorcery can be wielded&lt;br&gt;
to achieve results and provide information&lt;br&gt;
is proportional to SA skill.&lt;br&gt;
To a new SA sorcery is probably somewhat confusing&lt;br&gt;
and perhaps not very interesting.&lt;br&gt;
But then again so were building blocks&lt;br&gt;
when I first saw them.&lt;br&gt;
At best I could make only a rectangular house.&lt;br&gt;
Not until many years later did someone show me&lt;br&gt;
how something that looked like a spaceship could&lt;br&gt;
be created from the building blocks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Sorry for the long explanation.&lt;br&gt;
But I hope it shows how sorcery and Sorcerer&lt;br&gt;
can be and can become a positive experience for a SA&lt;br&gt;
that has the tenacity required to become a senior level SA.&lt;br&gt;
Starting with something easier is possible.&lt;br&gt;
However, eventually, it will probably lead a SA&lt;br&gt;
back to something like Sorcerer eventually.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My apology if that insinuates Sorcerer SAs are&lt;br&gt;
elite, snobbish, power mongers.&lt;br&gt;
To the contrary they are nice, helpful, and capable.&lt;br&gt;
Half of the time they tend to supply answers to&lt;br&gt;
to their own technical support questions.&lt;br&gt;
Even I enjoy receiving bug reports along with solutions.&lt;br&gt;
That is great for me since it saves me time and effort.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Being a Sorcerer SA is both a great experience and&lt;br&gt;
also a bit like a badge of honor because to join us&lt;br&gt;
requires a rare combination of tenacity and/or skill.&lt;br&gt;
And yes, what one lacks in skill can be compensated&lt;br&gt;
with raw tenacity.&lt;br&gt;
Merely, trying all the paths that do not work eventually&lt;br&gt;
will lead a person to the path of success.&lt;br&gt;
I forget what the name for that is called.&lt;br&gt;
Success through perseverance perhaps?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Making mistakes is not bad.&lt;br&gt;
Even by making a mistake one learns that&lt;br&gt;
is not an optimal method for achieving the desired result.&lt;br&gt;
So please grant yourself patience&lt;br&gt;
and enjoy the process of learning it&lt;br&gt;
even when making mistakes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To create the very first bootable Sorcerer I/R&lt;br&gt;
I did not copy nor look at what any other distro was doing.&lt;br&gt;
Instead I did some web searching to discover what software&lt;br&gt;
could be used as a bootloader on CDROM.&lt;br&gt;
I selected a few to try.&lt;br&gt;
Even upon deciding which one I wanted to use&lt;br&gt;
I did not achieve immediate success.&lt;br&gt;
Instead I spent nearly 5 days teaching myself how&lt;br&gt;
to successfully create a bootable CDROM image.&lt;br&gt;
Not everything comes immediately and easy.&lt;br&gt;
Even the current sorcery tools&lt;br&gt;
are a product of a decade&#39;s worth&lt;br&gt;
of use and feedback from SAs.&lt;br&gt;
It did not become awesome overnight.&lt;br&gt;
And the first rough drafts of the tools were&lt;br&gt;
little more than a technology demonstration&lt;br&gt;
that provided that source based management was possible.&lt;br&gt;
Unfortunately, most of the original design&lt;br&gt;
and original implementation had to be discarded&lt;br&gt;
due to short-sightedness and critical design flaws.&lt;br&gt;
That does seem to imply that it was a failure,&lt;br&gt;
but I prefer to think of it as a stepping stone on&lt;br&gt;
the path towards success.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes success is closer than it might seem.&lt;br&gt;
But it can only be achieved by those with sufficient tenacity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The reason for that digression is to demonstrate&lt;br&gt;
that the high skill required in order to wield sorcery&lt;br&gt;
and install Sorcerer can be achieved through tenacity.&lt;br&gt;
Like many things in life,&lt;br&gt;
one can not fail at trying to becoming a Sorcerer SA&lt;br&gt;
unless one decides to quit trying.&lt;br&gt;
Personally, I feel that way about the Japanese language.&lt;br&gt;
Learning Japanese for an English speaker is very difficult.&lt;br&gt;
But as long as I do not quit trying&lt;br&gt;
then I have not yet failed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Tenacity is not merely that which separates senior level SAs&lt;br&gt;
from regular SAs, but also what separates most normal people&lt;br&gt;
from occupations like software engineer that require tenacity.&lt;br&gt;
I have met people that totally lack tenacity.&lt;br&gt;
They give into the slightest frustration&lt;br&gt;
and throw temper-tantrums.&lt;br&gt;
I feel sorry for those people because they move&lt;br&gt;
even simple tasks into the realm of impossibility.&lt;br&gt;
But that is a digression I do not want to continue to follow.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Rather instead because you decided upon Sorcerer&lt;br&gt;
you are likely a person who has the required tenacity.&lt;br&gt;
In spite of what anyone might say to encourage you&lt;br&gt;
or discourage you, please remain confident in yourself.&lt;br&gt;
Remember the fable of &quot;the tortoise and the hare.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Even if slow moving,&lt;br&gt;
that which continues to push forward will eventually succeed,&lt;br&gt;
while those who have natural talent but lack tenacity&lt;br&gt;
will probably snooze and lose.&lt;br&gt;
