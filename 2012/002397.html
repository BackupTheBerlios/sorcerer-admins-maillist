<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>First another queue and utility was added.
It is called reuse.
It's tasks is for identifying and saving
customized configuration files in /aux/use/
Like oust which saves installed spell content in /aux/old/;
reuse also can run in advance of cast and dispel.

A compact information line is provided at the bottom of
# au scry
that provides information about the queues
Down is for download
Cast is for casting
Reap is for dispelling
Prov is for providing sources
Exp is for expediting compilation using ccache,
Use is for reusing customized configuration files
Oust is for copying installed spells to /aux/old/

After each number comes a fraction.
But it is not actually a fraction.
And so I might change the separator to : instead.
The first value or pseudo numerator represents either
the amount being processed which is the situation with
Down Cast and Reap.
Or it indicates the total amount processed
which is the situation with Prov Exp Use Oust.
The pseudo denominator always indicates the amount yet to go.
So all the pseudo denominators start high when an install or upgrade begins
and eventually reach 0.
When everything is 0/0 then nothing is happening.
All the pseudo numerators also approach 0 as spells are processed.
However, some might retain a value for longer.
If Miss Elf events are ongoing then /aux/old/ might not clear.
In that situation Oust's pseudo numerator will not drop.
The pseudo numerator for USE indicates the amount of spells
that already have their configuration files saved in /aux/use/
That drops as spells cast.
But if a spell does not successfully cast
then it's modified configuration files
will still remain saved in /aux/use/
Exp's numerator indicates the amount of directories in
/var/cache/sorcery/ccache/
Eventually, sentinel-space will convert those into tarballs
where they will be xz compressed and reside in /var/cache/ccache/

This change also moves /usr/src/sorcery/ to /var/cache/sorcery/
The reason for /usr/src/sorcery/ was to be congruent with the
recommendations of the FHS.
<A HREF="http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/">http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/</A>
However, the suggestion is weak and FHS does not seem to be updating,
last updated on 20040129.

More important than the FHS is that some SAs might prefer using /var/cache/
instead for file system reasons or for performance reasons.
The best performance for compilation is probably achieved when
/var/cache/sorcery/ exists as it's own dedicated 40G ext3 partition.
But that is neither mandatory nor a recommendation.

The sorcery utilities now have
7 multi-state queues and
several program components.
Yes, it is confusing and complex.
So why has it become this way?

The delegation of specific tasks that involve disk I/O
allows for the I/O to be spread more evenly.
And I/O that previously caused wait cycles
can be executed before the outcome is required.
Therefore, less CPU cycles become idle and wait
while waiting for the mass storage device.

Ideally, when a spell begins casting the sources for a software project
then compilation can begin immediately.
Upon successful completion dispel is invoked
which removes the previously installed spell's files.
Finally, the newly installed files are analyzed and installed.

In the past casting a spell also required:
untarring sources:
untarring saved ccache tarball:
ousting files to /aux/old/:
and saving customized configuration files to /aux/use.
Because those tasks can now be accomplished
before a spell begins casting;
spells can cast faster.
When casting 100 spells or more for an update
the efficiency can result in completion of casting
many minutes if not an hour sooner.

Okay, so casting is complete.
Can the box be rebooted?
Yes it can.
And if the kernel was updated
then it should be rebooted.
The directories that remain in /var/cache/sorcery/ccache/
will still be there when the box reboots.
Therefore, sentinel-space can create tarballs and compress
tarballs when the box next boots.

The tasks that involve creating additional logs for spells
such as LA logs, ELF logs, md5sum logs, archives and such
are now done in parallel with installing a spell's files.
This results in better utilization on SMP
and better utilization of the kernel's cache
especially for boxes which do not have 2G of RAM installed per processor.

Installation of a spell's files is designed and intended to run slowly.
This helps diminish demand for I/O while allowing concurrently casting spells
increased access to processors.
However, this also causes many processes
to be started that run for a while.
Consequently, installing a spell while concurrently casting others
can inflate loadavg during installation.
That is because several processes are running,
but also intentionally starved of CPU cycles.
The higher loadavg does not represent an undesireable state.
It simply helps spread the I/O while
maintaining the processor's attention on compiling source.

Most of the time the sorcery utilities contribution to loadavg
is approximately the same or one more than
the amount of processors that are delegated to sorcery.
Therefore, 9 could be a rather typical loadavg on an 8 core box
where all processors are delegated to sorcery.
However, the loadavg might temporarily spike +4
for each spell casting during it's install phase.

Although previously mentioned some SAs might yet want to know
how to delegate processors to sorcery.
Actually, it is rather easy.
# /etc/init.d/cgroup configure
Select Edit
Select cpuset.cpus
Select slow/sorcery
Then enter the processors to use.
separate the processors with a comma
or specify a range using a hyphen.
To 3 processors on a 4 processor box
1-3
would be a good value to enter.
To use 6 processors on an 8 processor box then
2-7
would be a good value to enter.

Delegation of processors to sorcery using control groups
provides an alternate method for controlling resource allocation
in contrast with selecting the &quot;min&quot; feature which
explicitly minimizes cast's use of resources.
cast however still requires about 1G per processor.
Therefore, if a box has 8 cores and 4G of RAM
then perhaps only 4 or 5 cast processor will run concurrently.
Best not to understock the loadout of RAM.

I hope this email helps mitigates confusion.
Most of these changes are transparent.
However, moving /usr/src/sorcery to /var/cache/sorcery/ is not so transparent.
I am not trying to overwhelm anyone with technobabble.
I apologize if the explanation of changes seems overly verbose.
