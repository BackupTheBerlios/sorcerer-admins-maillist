<PRE>Hello all, I just downloaded Sorcerer but I'm not very keen on going into the installation blindly. Is there any sort of documentation for installation? I've been looking around and I can't find any. I read the basic instructions, so I booted it up and poked around, but I'm afraid of messing up and destroying my system. (I'm dual-booting, btw). I already know the basic things, like partinioning and setting up root and home, but I would hardly call myself an expert on this. 

 If there isn't any documentation/guide I can go through, then I have a few questions--I hope you guys don't mind. I apologize in advance for the newbness of some of these :)

 1. Is it required to set up a wired or wireless connection during installation? 
 2. Are there any post-install necessities? 
 3. I went a bit into the installation before rewinding, and I noticed this doesn't seem to use the grub bootloader. The thing is, I already have grub. Is there a way for Sorcerer to use grub, or do I have to install lilo? 

 Normally I'd like to work through it and figure it out as I go but I don't have a free weekend any time soon and would very much like to set up a system I can use with as little pain as possible--I have a paper to write, and that has to take priority :) I'm not asking to have my hand held throughout the process, but I'd really appreciate anything tips or certain instructions you guys can give. 

 Thanks.
