<PRE>About a quarter of the time
I want to look at a compile log
after dispel already removed it.
As I pondered a solution for this
I slowly began to remember that
I forgot to complete the migration
of most types of information logs
to event logs.

I remember that when I first deprecated the 3 individual
activity logs for cast, dispel, and leech
that some people were not pleased with the forced transition
to event logs in order to gather that information.
And for a while I implemented an
# augur activity
in order to gather and display the same information
from event logs rather than the deprecated activity logs.
And now that augur command module is gone
and I wonder why or when I removed it.
But that is a digression.
What I intend to indicate was that after the initial
transition to event logs I decided to delay the
migration of the additional logs.
Of course, then I forgot entirely about it.
I have no idea how many years ago that happened.
But it seems like a good idea now.

The event logs are disposable.
Nothing breaks if they are not retained.
They are purely informational.
And they can be automatically pruned
by immune-exam-clean

I might have already mentioned event logs this year.
But I added 3 new types of event logs:

Down Load       Output from curl while downloading files
Past Post       Installed file log when spell successfully cast
Snap Shot       Installed loadout  when spell successfully cast

And that is exactly how it appears.
Download logs, history logs, and snapshot logs will now be generated
each as an event log.
Of course they are gzip compressed to reduce the required space on disk.
And I was able to code backward compatibility for snapshot logs,
but unfortunately, not for history logs since I changed the way they are stored.

For the change to be properly noticed
I am renaming
# augur snapshot
to
# augur snap

and
# augur history
to
# augur past

Their input remains the same.
Output will probably differ.

I am renaming the files for SAs to notice the change
try the modified augur command modules
and modify their scripts/programs to be able to parse the output.
Also I tend to type commands such as:
# au past
And past is faster to type than history.  :)
Same idea.
And it goes with the event log type of &quot;Past Post&quot;

Obviously, I am attempting to create logical yet short names.
When viewing information spanning several columns
then width becomes important.
And short names are easier to recognize than single or dual character acronyms.
Yes it is silly, but I like this sort of thing.

I use
# au event $SPELL
and enjoy the columns.

I recognize that not everyone is skilled at accessing event logs by
command line.
Not everyone knows to press ctrl-v before pressing tab.
Consequently, I created a menu driven event viewer.
And of course named it:
# augur event-menu

I am not fond of creating menus and dialogs for use with augur,
since I usually prefer to add that to the sorcery tool instead.
However, I made an exception in the past for
# augur scry-menu
Maybe almost nobody has discovered it?
While doing
# au scry
M jumps to the scry menu.
I never use it and so just now checked to see how it is accessed
and to verify that it still works as expected.

Sorry, I easily digress.
The topic of conversation is the transition of existing log types to event logs.
And one type of log is not transitioning.
I am entirely discarding the dispel logs.
In retrospect it was far less useful than I expected.
I do not remember the last time I was interested
in reading or grepping something from the dispel log.

The reason I am not transitioning the dispel log to an event log
is because dispel works differently than cast and leech.
When dispel runs it processes ALL the spells queued for dispel in a single run.
Being able to dispel the loadout of 2 to 256 installed spells concurrently
is faster than dispelling each linearly.

That is not because of SMP nor driving a high load nor any nonsense.
dispel uses many external commands such as sed, sort, uniq.
And running the content of several spells concurrently
is faster because of fewer invocations to helper programs.
However, the files and directories are still processed linearly.
Dispel can cause I/O lag
only when copying of files from their installed location to the OLD_CACHE/
The files are copied sequentially, yet also rapidly.

The blkio.weight for dispel is 100
as compared with the normal weight of 1000 for services and user run programs.
Actually, it looks more like:

# find /etc/cgroup/ -name blkio.weight | xargs --max-lines=64 grep .
/etc/cgroup/norm/blkio.weight:700
/etc/cgroup/norm/user/blkio.weight:800
/etc/cgroup/norm/sys/blkio.weight:700
/etc/cgroup/idle/blkio.weight:10
/etc/cgroup/idle/user/blkio.weight:10
/etc/cgroup/idle/sys/blkio.weight:10
/etc/cgroup/slow/sorcery/blkio.weight:100
/etc/cgroup/slow/sorcery/leech/blkio.weight:100
/etc/cgroup/slow/sorcery/cast/blkio.weight:200
/etc/cgroup/slow/sorcery/dispel/blkio.weight:100
/etc/cgroup/slow/blkio.weight:100
/etc/cgroup/slow/user/blkio.weight:500
/etc/cgroup/slow/sys/blkio.weight:500
/etc/cgroup/real/blkio.weight:1000
/etc/cgroup/real/sys/blkio.weight:1000
/etc/cgroup/fast/blkio.weight:900
/etc/cgroup/fast/user/blkio.weight:900
/etc/cgroup/fast/sys/blkio.weight:900

Unless the SA customized it more so by running
# /etc/init.d/cgroup configure
then a user should have about 7 times greater access to throughput than dispel.
Yet it never seems that way if/when a box experiences I/O lag.
Best solution seems to involve having plenty of installed and available RAM.
The kernel automatically re-tasks most available RAM to the role of I/O caching.
After the blocks are written due to memory pressure, a sync, or commit
timer trigger,
then the RAM can be re-tasked when required by processes.

That completes this digression.
A small lesson about event logs
followed by a smaller lesson about control groups.
Control groups are fascinating, even more so than analog cathode ray televisions
with knobs on the front to change channels and
to adjust frequency tuning of stations
in order to compensate for reflected signals, frequency shifts, etc...
No more knobs, no more snow on television every day,
and no more dispel logs.
Missing it already?
Of course not.
Some things we can do without.

Please try the:
# augur event-menu
# augur snap
# augur past
commands in order to gain familiarly and retain recollection.
As always
# augur help event-menu
# augur help snap
# augur help past
provide verbose help screens for those commands.

BTW, I am sending this email
about 2 days before the improved sorcery tools become available.
For now I am hogging all the bugs and fun to myself.
Okay, not many bugs, but plenty of fun.  :)
