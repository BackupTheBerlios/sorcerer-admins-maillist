<PRE>Thanks.
I added additional code to sorcery
in order to handle the broke source tarballs that KDE software authors
continue to create.

I am upgrading some of the libraries that gcc uses.
And I am doing a standard update of spells for new versions of source tarballs
that my Internet mining programs discovered.

I want to have the newer software on the next I/R release.

BTW, I did not announce it on the list previously
but I added a limiter to cast which should help wrangle
the loadavg without creating idle cycles.
It does not monitor the loadavg and so if something else
is creating high load in addition to cast
then the loadavg might still be more than 1 over processing cores.
However, normally it maintains a loadavg of nearly processing cores or 1 more.

That will be useful for SAs that want to run sorcery on 8+ processing
unit SMP boxes,
but do not want to enable feature min in order to avoid the potential
worst case scenario
of reaching a 128 loadavg.  :)
I doubt it could actually happen even without the limiters.
Worst case loadavg created entirely by cast
on a quad core x86_64 is theoretically 32.
Yet I never observed it surpassing loadavg 16.
Ideal loadavg would be approximately 5
which is what the limiter is designed to achieve.

The reason to dread high loadavg is not because of wasted CPU cycles
during task swapping,
but rather due to increased memory consumption when the loadavg is not caused
by disk I/O
And even excessive swapping causing disk I/O is undesirable.

The amount of sources that would use an excessive amount of RAM during
compilation
and especially during linking has increased in recent years which is why
sometime in the previous year I quit providing an init-script to mount
tmpfs on /usr/src/sorcery/
File fragmentation and some loss of speed is preferred over creating
I/O caused by swapping.
The use of tmpfs was a good idea during the years when computers
tended to be over-built,
or having more RAM and CPU than required.
However, software authors have adjusted to that trend and again
pre-made computers
tend to be under-built and unsuitable for Sorcerer.
A Sorcerer box should have at least 2G of RAM and at least 1G of RAM
per processing core.
Therefore, a quad core box with 3G of RAM installed would be under-built.
A quad core box with 4G of RAM installed would suffice.
And a quad core box with 8G of RAM installed would be advantageous.

Sorry, I digress.
My point was that the sorcery tools are designed to use as much power
as the box can provide when the &quot;min&quot; feature is not enabled.
And the limiter aspects helps prevent resource overuse.
If anyone might wonder why resource overuse would be a problem
then that is because cast does something that other source managers
might not do.
cast does multiple make when possible,
multiple concurrent ELF 32-bit and ELF 64-bit compilation when possible,
and multiple concurrent compilation of several spells when possible.
Succinctly, if cast detects that the box can handle more
then cast will give the box more to handle.
In contrast other source managers might be able to do one of the above,
or maybe 2 of the above, but not all 4.
Consequently, not knowing when compilation of a source will contribute
a loadavg of 1 or a loadavg of 4 on a quad core box
becomes an uncertain factor that the limiters mitigate.

4 spells concurrently casting, both ELF 32-bit and ELF 64-bit versions,
with 4 parallel make enabled on each has potential for creating:
4 * 2 * 4 = 32 loadavg.
However, the limiters should help keep that closer to 5 instead.

The limiters are not present on the current I/Rs.
The new code will be available on newer I/Rs.

So I might not appear to be doing much.
But rather I am attempting to limit how much I do.  :)
