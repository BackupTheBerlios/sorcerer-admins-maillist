<PRE>Thanks for inviting everyone to the IRC channel.
However, I already spent most of the day pounding wpa_supplicant.
And now my head is pounding me back.  :)

Development on the project continues even in 2012, apparently.
But it's all dev/unstable in git and not rolled into tarballs.
I did a git checkout to see if some bugs still persist.
And they do.

Anyway, I wrote an init-script to start wpa_supplicant
for all wireless interfaces during boot.
That seems good, works even.
wpa-psk works on my new wireless router and Sorcerer boxes.
However, wpa_cli does not seem to communicate with wpa_supplicant.
Does anyone immediately know why?
I expect someone with more experience using wpa_supplicant
might have already encountered and fixed the problem on their box.
Might be a bug in wpa_supplicant.

Speaking of bugs...
kdm might not at boot in runlevel 4.
Saw that happen.
Have not had time to investigate.
Anyone already know why?
I suspect it had something to do with /etc/init.d/depmod,
but maybe not, in either case I rewrote that because
depmod -A does not work as expected.

Oh, both the proprietary ?packages? for installing
NVIDIA and ATI graphics drivers aught to work.
I check and repair of them recently.
ati-driver-installer is now renamed to amd-driver-installer.
And I did find and fix the reason for why it was not
compiling and installing a kernel module.
It was not actually a spell problem, but appears
to be a problem with the package.
However, I was able to circumvent the problem with the spell.

I updated the wpa_supplicant and networks spells.
Those aught to work a little bit better.
However, if wpa_cli is unable to communicate with wpa_supplicant
then perhaps the only way to make wpa_supplicant perform
is to have a proper config file for it.
So I eventually want to fix that.

Thanks for answering questions on the IRC channel.
I do not make much time to chat.
I tend to answer inquiries by email,
and then often too verbosely.

I spent the past few weeks doing debugging stuff.
I fixed a massive amount of spells, tossed some old ones,
improved some existing ones, etc...

Oh speaking about bugs again...
Something that installs after gdk-pixbuf is capable of breaking it.
Then other programs like gimp will encounter a compile error
until gdk-pixbuf is cast again.
The problem might only occur on some boxes.
I have yet to identify the culprit.
Anyone have a hunch about it?

Although I intend to roll new I/Rs sometimes this month
I still have much on my todo list that gives cause for
irritation if I roll I/Rs the way that they currently are.

I realize that Sorcerer Sentient boxes have some bugs.
If any are too annoying might want to consider
transitioning the box to Sorcerer Modern Magic.
I only update Sorcerer Sentient's grimoire
when I roll new I/Rs.
That is when I estimate that the grimoire
spells and installed software are most optimal.

Anyone who wants to pursue and squish any
of the bugs listed above please be my guest
and report the outcome.
If anyone idling in the channel awaiting conversation feels disappointed
then please wield a bug swatter and smite the bugs.
The sooner these bugs are smote the sooner we can enjoy new I/Rs.

P.S. I want to deprecate lilo
and totally have any Sorcerer boxes with lilo installed
automatically transition to extlinux.
Yet, the automatic transition has a small probability of breaking,
and definitely will not import customized lilo head and tail files.
Overall I feel very pleased with extlinux, with just one
bug presently causing irritation.
But I already reported it on their email list
and so maybe they will slay it sometime soon.
Does anyone have objects concerning a
forced automatic transition to extlinux?
I forgot how long we have been using extlinux now,
at least 6 months if not a year.
Decent is it not?

I did not know if extlinux would be suitable at first.
However, hindsight is better than leaping before looking.
So now I feel satisfied.
Please voice contrary opinions.
