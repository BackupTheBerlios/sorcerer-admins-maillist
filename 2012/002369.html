<PRE>Hi there, Leanna.

Congratulations on installing Sorcerer. I'm sure that I speak for all of us
when I say that we all hope you really enjoy using Sorcerer as much as we
do.

&gt;<i> Sorry to be sending you an email directly...I guess my newbness is showing

</I>Hit &quot;Reply to all&quot; on your mail client, that should do the trick, or add
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sorcerer-admins">sorcerer-admins at lists.belios.de</A> to CC, like I have.


I followed your advice and I was able to dual-boot Sorcerer. I just wanted
&gt;<i> to say thanks for the advice, it really helped.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thanks for the persistence. It's lightyears removed from the first Sorcery
install I did nearly eight years ago.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and also--
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. it's not often that we get a newbie around here, and your questions
</I>&gt;<i> and remarks are incredibly important to us in making Sorcery more newbie
</I>&gt;<i> friendly. So, please feel free to jot down what you have problems with,
</I>&gt;<i> what you found easy and your overall user experience... and send that back
</I>&gt;<i> to us to help us improve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I'm one of those motivated newbies who starts of at the deep end of
</I>&gt;<i> things and learns on the way :) As for Sorcerer being newbie friendly...I
</I>&gt;<i> understand that it isn't what this distro really aims for when I downloaded
</I>&gt;<i> it, so with that being considered, installation isn't uneccessarily
</I>&gt;<i> grueling, at least from a newbie's perspective :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you can hang up your newb hat about now, and start eying that
</I>hacker hat. ;)


Anyway, the only trouble I'm having with it so far is getting my wireless
&gt;<i> card to be recognized and trying to install the firmware needed.
</I>
Well, if you manage this feat, you definitely do not deserve to be called
newb anymore.
Use the utility lspci to find out who made the wireless card that you have,
read as much as you can about it. I have an iwlwifi card in my laptop, and
can probably help you if you have something similar, or at least point you
in the right direction. It may just be that we don't have firmware for your
card yet, but with a good enough description, we can hack something
together that might work for you.

Unfortunately, that is only step 1. Actually connecting to a wireless
network is a little more painful than it needs to be, as I have been unable
to find a GUI that works in KDE and can set up my wifi. I try about once a
year, and have given up in disgust a few times now.
I can tell you the steps I take, and Kyle might have his own take on
things, too.


&gt;<i> But as far as installation goes, I don't think you have to be worried
</I>&gt;<i> about it not being intuitive or user friendly to anyone who has even a
</I>&gt;<i> little experience installing other distributions.
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, installing it was easier than some other distros I've tried.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thanks for the compliment!




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, thanks a lot for helping me with dual-booting (although probably
</I>&gt;<i> sometime in the future I'll switch to just Sorcerer, when I can completely
</I>&gt;<i> be independent of Windows :))
</I>
I wish I could be completely free of Windows too. This may sound a bit like
a rant because it probably will be, but what's up with hardware
manufacturers that use Linux internally, and then does not have a Linux
client of their software so someone that uses linux can actually upgrade
firmware, etc? It's like a slap in the face!

I tell you, I would gladly pay USD 1000.00 for a phone that I am able to do
a firmware update on in Linux. Same goes for a GPS...

&lt;/rant&gt;

Anyways, Leanna, glad to have you on board. I hope it's all plain sailing
from now on. If you have any specific Sorcerer questions, please do not
hesitate to ask either me, or Kyle, or post the question to the list.

Hope you have a groovy week.
