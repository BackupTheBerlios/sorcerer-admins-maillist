Actually, that is exactly the same type of logic
that I apply to updates of VirtualBox.
Virtual box remains at version 4.1.8, because versions
4.1.9, 4.1.10, 4.1.11, 4.1.12, 4.1.13, and 4.1.14
failed to compile and install.
I could probably fix it.
But the bug was probably introduced by the software authors.
Perhaps it is a conspiracy to modify the source
so that it compiles only on their preferred distro?
Really, I do not know.
What I do know is that qemu-kvm works awesome
and has been my choice for a few years.
Consequently, I have allocated few hours to fixing VirtualBox,
because I already gave it at least 40 hours in the past.
I fixed it and yet it would not stay fixed.
And so the version is currently held at 4.1.8.

In the spell is the comment,

&quot;# Does anyone want to use VirtualBox instead of qemu?&quot;

Finally, I have an answer to that.
Yes, one person wants it.
But that person has yet to deploy Sorcerer.
Consequently, I might allocate 8 hours to fixing it before the end of the year.
But even if I add lines to the spell to modify the source tree
in order to obtain successful compilation of version 4.1.14 and later versions;
such a change will not assist someone who wants to use VirtualBox
for running Sorcerer on an non Sorcerer host.

My way of thinking is that if the virtual machine program does not have bugs,
that would make my assumption incorrect,
then a Sorcerer I/R should be usable on VirtualBox, qemu, qemu-kvm,
and perhaps even bochs.
However, I have not tried bochs in years.
Perhaps my assumption is incorrect.
Yet I made no special modifications to the I/R
in order to be able to run it using qemu-kvm.

My best guess is that if someone wants to try Sorcerer on a virtual machine
and encounters a problem that prevents booting
then they were probably thinking something like,
&quot;Awesome, I am going to boot Sorcerer
on my 256M RAM virtual machine.
Here it goes.&quot;
And there it went straight into forever lag land.
I do not recommend booting the Sorcerer I/R
on a virtual machine with less than 1G of installed RAM
granted to the virtual machine.

The Sorcerer I/R has those significantly sized initramfs images
that are xz compressed.
Consequently, the amount of RAM required to load it is
Kernel, compressed images, space required to uncompress initramfs images,
space required to hold uncompressed files on rootfs,
space to run init-scripts and start services/daemons,
space to hold some additional files extracted from archives,
space to run installer, space to extract xz compressed archives, etc...
So basically, I am talking about plenty of space that is used
where almost none of it is re-taskable.
The RAM used to hold the compressed initramfs images
and decompress them can not be retasked by the kernel
until after the content of those xz compressed cpio images
is extracted and stored on rootfs which is a special type of tmpfs.
It is something like a money back offers where one must
spend $300 or more, send in receipt and completed form,
and then wait 6 months for a check to arrive by snail mail.
So better to go in with a full gigabyte of RAM
instead of trying to skirt across at the bare minimum
which risks a wipeout.

PAE is a requirement only for booting the IA32 I/R on an IA32 microprocessor
or an IA32 virtual machine emulated microprocessor.
If someone tries to boot the x86_64 I/R on an IA32 virtual machine
then a message will display that an x86_64 CPU is required to boot the kernel.
Whoever implement that, thanks.
The IA32 I/R can be booted on an x86_64 virtual machine, but is not
tested that way.

The minimum system specifications for using a Sorcerer I/R
is an 80686 microprocessor with PAE.
However, an x86_64 CPU, those with long mode,
are better choices for workstations and multimedia stations.
That is because displaying video can require
significant CPU and bus speed in order to process
even before being output to the memory of the graphics adapter.


&gt;<i> I don't know how to use qemu and that may be the problem. I'll figure out
</I>&gt;<i> how to download qemu and also I know a guy in town that could help me now.
</I>
Finally, the problem is identified.
And the solution is at:

Hurray, problem solved.
