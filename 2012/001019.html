<PRE>spell in Sorcerer. However I like the idea that sorcerer should be able to
install, and run within VirtualBox, so that if some want to test-drive
Sorcerer within VirtualBox it do work. But the main work with this is not
sorcerers but Sun's.

We could make the task a bit more easy (I think) if we could provide the
option in the I/R to install grub as the bootloader instead of lilo.

So if I where to decide, I would say based upon this, that I would rather
prefer that we used the time to implement grub in the I/R (which could be of
value in other situations too) - and then either use qemu or perhaps VMware
as the Virtual Host Application (VMWare server can you download for free.
Eventhough it is closed source, but it is - in my view - almost as fast, as
VirtualBox)

Best regards

Bent Jakobsen

Hi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we want to use it or not, I shall not decide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only=
 real reason I know of is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* It is faster than qemu when it is runni=
ng. However the &quot;price tag&quot; is less freedom (to chose the emulati=
ng guest architecture). &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;But if this is good enough... I do not know. Because I do not know if h=
aving VirtualBox in Sorcerer is adding sufficiently value, to justify the w=
ork-load of first creating the spells (for VirtualBox and the requirements)=
 and afterwards maintaining them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;From my point of view... I can live happily without having VirtualBox a=
s a spell in Sorcerer. However I like the idea that sorcerer should be able=
 to install, and run within VirtualBox, so that if some want to test-drive =
Sorcerer within VirtualBox it do work. But the main work with this is not s=
orcerers but Sun&#39;s. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We could make the task a bit more easy (I think) if we could provide th=
e option in the I/R to install grub as the bootloader instead of lilo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=
br&gt;So if I where to decide, I would say based upon this, that I would rathe=
r prefer that we used the time to implement grub in the I/R (which could be=
 of value in other situations too) - and then either use qemu or perhaps VM=

&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp;* Q: How does VirtualBox relate to QEMU? I have seen so=
me source&lt;br&gt;
files that appear to be related to his project.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 &nbsp; &nbsp;A: VirtualBox makes use of QEMU in two ways: first of all, so=
me of&lt;br&gt;
our virtual hardware devices have their origin in the QEMU project. We&lt;br&gt;
have found them to be very useful and took them as a starting point.&lt;br&gt;
Secondly, we have incorporated the recompiler of QEMU as a fallback&lt;br&gt;
mechanism for situations where our Virtual Machine Manager (VMM)&lt;br&gt;
cannot correctly handle a certain situation. This holds true for guest&lt;br&gt;
code that executes in real mode (such as bootup) and some rare&lt;br&gt;
scenarios at runtime. See VirtualBox architecture for details. QEMU&lt;br&gt;
saved us a lot of work and we are very grateful to be able to rely on&lt;br&gt;
it.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to the above URL,&lt;br&gt;
VirtualBox forked from qemu what might be the most essential code for&lt;br&gt;
a virtual machine emulator.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Also VirtualBox requires qt-x11-free.&lt;br&gt;
However, since VirtualBox must be compiled with ancient gcc&lt;br&gt;

seems to be heavy requirement.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Could someone please remind me why we would want to use VirtualBox&lt;br&gt;
instead of qemu?&lt;br&gt;
