<PRE>In spite of my constant complaining I managed to pound gnome into shape.
Luck must favor those who keep trying, no?
Maybe we can do new I/R sometime soon?

Evert mentioned that OpenGL was not working after KDE was moved into /usr
Glad he spotted and mentioned that.
I could have failed to know the /usr/lib64 rpath in kde libraries and
programs for at least a year.
I normally do not want to use KDE's compositing and eye-candy.

Fixing effected boxes requires recasting of all installed spells with
attribute kde4.
Of course if one prefers KDE without the additional eye candy provided
by compositing
then leaving KDE as is works fine.

To recast all installed kde4 after installing a current grimoire...
# au installed kde4 | au begin
Did anyone expect it would be more difficult?

We also owe Evert thanks for spotting that I did not properly
copy the linux configs in grimoire/linux.d/
That is already a moot point,
but I am committing a new version of linx to svn soon
and that update will automatically install a linux
that provides all the modules we expect and possibly require.


gnome-screensaver gained an absolute requirement on systemd.
systemd is a replacement for system V initialization.
The ideas about how to make a ?better? or at least more parallel boot
method have been on the discussion table for a few years now.
Looks like those ideas have materialized in the implementation systemd.

I barely investigated systemd.
Apparently it is a substitute for sysvinit.
I do not know if it is suitable for use on Sorcerer.
Sorcerer boxes have an excellent and useful initramfs.
Minimalistic initramfs are used on other distros.
Consequently, far more happens during Sorcerer sysvinit.

Additionally, sytemd relies on auto-mounting partitions and virtual
file systems,
starting a daemon that provides and hands-off sockets to other daemons,
and maybe other fancy things that implement their idea of total
parallel startup.
That way only about a handful of services must be started sequentially.
This differs from the parallel runlvel steps that exist in Sorcerer.
Sorcerer's init does not become parallel until runlevel execution begins.
Yet most Sorcerer boxes clear sysinit rapidly.
Duration varies depending on how fast extlinux
reads initramfs from disk using BIOS interrupts.
Therefore, even if Sorcerer did switch from sysvinit to systemd
the load time of initramfs would not differ
and the time required for sysinit would likely vanish with parallelism.

Aside from such obvious difference systemd might offer improvements in
control or logs.
It might have a method of reporting it's activities on the system bus
and/or system log.
And like Sorcerer's enhanced system V init;
systemd also uses control groups for tracking PIDS of daemons.
However I have no idea if systemd's use of the cgroup file system
is similar or compatible with Sorcerer.
Maybe it might be better?

Considerable off email list chatter exists among Sorcerer developers
concerning the use of cgroup on Sorcerer.
Almost no consensus exists.
Therefore, the current implementation favors simplicity.
The possibility exists that other distros might have decided upon a
better implementation.

If systemd becomes a standard
then SAs will be expected to know how to use it.
Therefore, Sorcerer staying with sysvinit
could make Sorcerer appear legacy or lacking.
The actual reason why we do not already use something like systemd is because
Sorcerer's SysVinit evolved to make use of new technologies such as
control groups.
And Sorcerer somehow missed out on experiencing many boot related
problems/inconveniences
that were experienced by other distros.
Perhaps due to luck we discovered and traveled the less bramble full
path of booting?

Sorcerer originally was designed as a distro to boot without initramfs.
However, Sorcerer eventually switched to provide an initramfs
for different reasons than other distros.
Consequently, the Sorcerer initramfs was designed differently
and provides functionality that far exceeds other distros.

If someone expects that systemd on Sorcerer could be a great combination
then please test it and report the findings.
Sorcerer has a backward compatible LSB commented init-script system.
However, Sorcerer init-scripts are not actually LSB compliant init-scripts.
systemd might not be able to run them without modification.
If it does work then someone must first test and report so that we can know.

If systemd becomes a standard replacement for sysvinit on other distros
then I will commence my own investigation perhaps in 2013.
Otherwise at the moment the task is available for delegation.
Anyone want command that sub project?
