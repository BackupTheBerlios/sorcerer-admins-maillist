Hi there. I can see that English is not your first language. Thanks for
taking the time and explaining your experiences with Sorcerer.

Sorcerer is not meant to be installed with another operating system on the
same computer.
Do you have a computer that you want to install only Sorcerer on, or do you
want to dual-boot with another OS?




&gt;<i> That is why I would love if there
</I>&gt;<i> was an Install-script that could install the Kernel and the Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> extensions on any computer, at least on Lenovo-Thinkpad. If you put
</I>&gt;<i> such a script on your HP, you would sertently get many more users for
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This already exists. If you boot from the I/R available from the Sorcery
web page, it will boot up in a text only environment. Just read whatever is
on screen, and use the cursor keys ( arrows on your keyboard ) to select
the desired action. If you don't know what the choices mean, choose the
default.

Again, I cannot stress enough that if there is any data on your computer
that you want to keep, that you back it up first!


 I'm not quite aquanted with how Sorcerer works but, If you gave the
&gt;<i> Cast-script the abillity to find a program's source from the users
</I>&gt;<i> input (cast &lt;program-name&gt;) and gave the user a possibility, via
</I>&gt;<i> numbers, to choose the right program from the ones Cast found on the
</I>&gt;<i> net, it would be very popular.
</I>&gt;<i>  Write back if you want a better explanation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It already works in this way internally. It also does dependency resolution
and optimization for your machine. There is even a menu for Sorcerer. Just
type sorcery at the command line, and press enter.

However, this is not all that is required for popularity, and being popular
has never been a goal for Sorcerer.
In fact, there are only very few people that run Sorcerer on a daily basis.

There are many reasons for this, but I will touch on the first few that pop
into my mind.

1. Nothing is configured for you in Sorcerer. You are expected to read the
manual of the software you are installing, and configure it yourself.

2. The license. Sorcerer is free to use, and copy, but you cannot fork it
like you can with GPL code. It belongs to Kyle Sallee, and due to reasons
that will take too long in this mail to explain, that is not about to
change. I highly suggest reading the license if you ever install Sorcerer.

3. It's unstable. Sorcerer is permanently in a state of flux. Some days are
better than others as far as software compiling, installing and running
correctly goes. We are permanently messing with the way Sorcerer works, and
that may stop it working correctly. However, you have our solemn promise
that this is not intentional, and that we will try our best to squash any
bugs that are brought to our attention.

So, why run Sorcerer at all?
1. Freedom. You can configure your software the way you like it. You learn
how it works, and use the software to it's full effect.

2. It's by far the most elegant distrobution as far as software handling is
concerned. Every year or so I try Gentoo, Funtoo or some Debian derivative.
They are bandwidth hogs, insult my intelligence and don't work the way I
do.

3. You learn how your computer work, and how to fix it. Also, there are
people running Sorcerer in production environments, but they don't just
blindly update, they have a machine that they test all updates on first
before throwing it on the production machine. This, and backups are just
good practice, no matter who wrote the software you are running.
