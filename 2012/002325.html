<PRE>Looks like Sorcerer was not the only site that experienced some downtime.
Fortunately, x.org and freedesktop.org and all the projects hosted there
are answering on port 80 again.
That is a relief, because I am checking in the X11R7.7 xorg update.

Basically, I try not to update software projects that are hosted on
xorg's download servers
until xorg makes an official release.
The tarballs released in the intermediate may be in order to fix bugs,
or they might be developmental and introduce bugs.
Unless I know that a terrible bug is being fixed
then delaying the updates for those software projects maximizes stability.
And if we rushed ahead with updates then certain much software would be unusable
for periods of time such as the NVIDIA pre-compiled binary drivers.

I am about a month late for the xorg update.
Then again I only check monthly to see if they made a new release.
I track this manually, because I track all their released source
tarballs automatically.
And watching one says nothing about the other.

The reason I am issuing this email is because now is a fine time to backup.
After the update xorg might not be exactly the same.  :)
I only try to make certain that it all compiles and fits together,
but I do not guarantee that it works properly at runtime.
And I lack the hardware required in order to test every driver.
And a few of the drivers now seem to be broke:
xf86-video-chips, xf86-video-rendition, xf86-video-tseng.
Hopefully, those are for chipsets that are considerably older than a decade old.
If so then maybe nobody will be effected
or perhaps the xf86-video-vesa will suffice?

The audit progresses rapidly.
Soon I will reach the end and begin a second pass to check marginally
old software projects
for released tarballs that are somehow obscured from view or if their
website changed or
their download URL changed.
After the audit completes I will begin processing more of the items on
my todo list.
And after those are todone I will be evaluating the possibility of new
I/R releases.

My long term goal is to have the audit integrated as part of my
regular check for new software tarball releases.
That way nothing in the grimoire goes too long without evaluation.
</PRE>
