That may create a /etc/X11/xorg.conf
that is usable for starting X.
However, I would not expect it to
contain explicit display modes to use.

It still reads as either a problem with
an xorg graphics driver or a problem
with the /etc/X11/xorg.conf

If the /etc/X11/xorg.conf provided by
/etc/init.d/xorg.conf is not a good start
then either import your own xorg.conf
or perhaps try creating a new one using
/usr/bin/xorgconfig.

With some xorg drivers, like the intel one,
merely killing the X server may or may not
return to a virtual console.
It may create a black screen or a very
strange looking screen with oddly colored lines.
If that happens I usually simply kill -9 X and
whatever GUI login program is running
and then start a GUI login program.

To more precisely conjecture the problem
I would require a verbose description
including a listing of loaded modules,
the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file being used,
and the output of lspci -v

That way I could check that the expected modules
are loaded, that the graphic hardware and
/etc/X11/xorg.conf are compatible,
that /etc/X11/xorg.conf is adequate.
As for the stability of the xorg graphics driver
that can not be determined without doing the
testing on the same hardware that you have.

As usual, you can always try the newest driver
available for download from x.org.
However, it might or might not compile.
It might or might not run.
In the case of an integrated savage video chipset
I discovered that the newer xorg driver avoided
bugs that were in the xorg graphics driver at
the time of the xorg release.

However, newer versions of xorg sources do not
all fit together as nicely as gnome sources.
Apparently, after trying gnome's gdm 2.22.0
even newer gnome sources do not always
work as expected.

I am still inclined to expect that /etc/X11/xorg.conf
is not yet complete enough to allow changing resolutions.
And that not returning to console when killed is due
to bugs in the xorg drivers.
Also running /etc/init.d/xorg.conf will accomplish nothing
if /etc/X11/xorg.conf already exists.
It will not create a new /etc/X11/xorg.conf
nor replace the old one.

If using NVIDIA-Linux-x86
then a proper /etc/X11/xorg.conf
is even more important.
And the NVIDIA-Linux-x86 documentation
describe how to do so and also provide a
program to assist with generating that config file.
/etc/init.d/xorg.conf would not generate an appropriate
/etc/X11/xorg.conf file to use with
NVIDIA-Linux-x86

As for ati-driver-installer may luck be on your side.
version 8-4-x86.x86_64 would not compile.
Version 8-5-x86.x86_64 does compile.
Does it work?
I have no idea.
Each time I put an ATI card in a computer
it spot welds the fan, it overheats, and flakes.
Usually one can hear a fan going bad,
but not if it melts into a fixed position
and never turns again.

In most cases the xorg VESA drivers can be used
in order to control the graphics card.
It is not fast, the cursor may look strange,
the font size and/or appearance may look strange,
but it will probably work.
If you enjoy 648x480x16 graphics then the
xorg VGA driver can provide that.
But I can not stand looking at that
for more than 30 minutes at a time.

If maximum X server performance is not an issue
then trying the VESA driver may provide a useful
baseline comparison.

On one card I had the choice between using:
s3virge s3 vesa and vga.
But the order I liked best was
s3 s3virge vesa vga.
Or was vesa before s3virge?
Do not remember exactly now.
But it does demonstrate that
there may be more than one
driver that can be used with the a card.

Looks like someone restored the xf86-video-i810 driver.
For i810 it will probably work better than the
xf86-video-intel driver.
But I do not know if that is necessarily so.
At one time I thought the xf86-video-intel driver
replaced the xf86-video-i810 driver because
the xf86-video-i810 driver was suspiciously
absent from that xorg release.

Of course I still have no idea what graphics
chipset is used in that box which is not changing
resolution modes from the gnome control panel.
Hopefully, the above information will be of some use?


&gt;<i> Result is - no resolution change and a black screen.
