<PRE>Since you are asking so nicely, I typed out some considerations for someone
that have not used Sorcerer before, and is maybe thinking of giving it a
spin.

I hereby release the following text to Kyle Sallee to do with as he wants.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorcerer Install Considerations.

Stuff to think about before you even download the Install/Rescue disk:
*
About you:*
Sorcerer requires a System Administrator.
Someone who is not afraid to read manuals, or spend a long time hunting down
some annoyance. If you are not afraid to deal with a command line, and are
looking for a way to learn more about UNIX in general and Linux and it's
standards in particular, Sorcerer might just be the distrobution for you.
Sorcerer has a community of very helpful and friendly people who frequent
it's mailing lists.

*
About your computer:*
1. Disk Space:
Sorcerer uses a lot of disk space. I would not install Sorcerer on a system
with less than 20Gb hard disk. While it is technically possible, it is
painful.

2. RAM:
Sorcerer runs best on systems with lots of fast memory. Below 1GB of RAM you
start thrashing your hard drive. While Sorcerer will run on less, you should
expect to be running a pretty frugal setup or waiting a long time for
compiles to complete.

3. CPU:
Sorcerer takes advantage of multiple CPU and CPU cores. The more the
merrier. No matter what the amount of CPU you have, Sorcerer will run at
quite a high nice value, and your computer will stay responsive even when
rebuilding everything. Sorcerer will also queue some jobs to be executed in
the background at a later time when it detects low CPU cycles.

4. Architecture:
Sorcerer Install/Rescue disks are x86 and x86_64 only. While no one sees any
difficulty running on some exotic hardware, no one has ported it yet.

5. Internet:
If you plan to run more software than what is on the I/R iso, this is pretty
much a requirement. Setting up a good all-round selection of software will
use quite a bit of bandwidth, but updates are small, and very frequent.


*Which Install/Rescue Image to download?*
Currently, there are only two. 32 bit and 64 bit. If you plan to be running
binary blobs of software not compiled by you, I would recommend 32 bit. If
you want to be on the bloodiest of bleeding edges, and your CPU supports it,
get the 64 bit version.

Download your poison and burn it on to a CD-ROM, read the install
instructions and install.

Welcome to the Sorcerer community.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kyle, since I am probably the one who have had the most installs of
Sorcerer, I'll create a virtual machine, install Sorcerer on there and
document the hoops.

Hopefully that will serve as an install guide. As you are quite aware, the
install process does change quite a bit with every I/R, and that doc might
need updates as we sort through the bugs.

</I>&gt;<i> I did not attempt to write this as HTML.
</I>&gt;<i> Just tried to type it fast and clean.
</I>&gt;<i> I may not be good at docs.
</I>&gt;<i> But I am the one who can answer the most questions about Sorcerer's init.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, I was probably a good choice for writing at least the draft
</I>&gt;<i> of this document that helps demystify Sorcerer's boot and shutdown.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SAs who have read what I wrote previously on the list already have a
</I>&gt;<i> good idea of how it works.
</I>&gt;<i> Those who were on and off on vacation understand bits and pieces.
</I>&gt;<i> However, this document helps provide a full and clear picture.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet it is not overly detailed.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, it should aid with clearing confusion rather than creating more.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course I might be entirely wrong about that?
</I>&gt;<i> But I gave it a good try.
</I>&gt;<i> Truly, the choice of content is as dry as can be
</I>&gt;<i> and my style of writing makes contact lenses feel like 80 grit sand paper.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I would appreciate feedback and corrections.
</I>&gt;<i> And I will eventually spell check it when I am not half asleap.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course Sorcerer still needs more documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> Docs that are useful, witty, and fun to read would be helpful.
</I>&gt;<i> Who is excited about documentation?
</I>&gt;<i> Now is the time to show what you know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Docs do not have to be entirely correct or entirely complete.
</I>&gt;<i> Is anyone entirely correct or entirely complete?
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, Sorcerer Documentation and next the Human Genome.
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, that would be nice, but sufficiently fast computers with
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient RAM may not demystify the human genome within our lifetime.
</I>&gt;<i> However, Sorcerer Documentation is well within our grasp.
</I>&gt;<i> Who is feeling excited enough to write some docs?
