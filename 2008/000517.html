<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>augur is becoming more modular like cast + grimore + spells.

In a few updates from now boxes will receive an augur
that has many files within /usr/libexec/sorcery/augur.d/ :

abort      category  elfof     history    lone     provider  sold
activity   check     elfon     hold       long     resume    sources
always     clear     estimate  homepage   merge    retry     src
arch       compile   event     index      newer    scry      static
arof       cpref     exile     install    older    search    suspend
arofni     custom    forget    installed  opt.off  shared    sync
aron       delay     from      iron       opt.on   short     update
attribute  details   go        lclof      order    size      version
available  easy      grimoire  leech      prefer   snapshot


Those filenames represent augur commands.
Most of them contain
most of the code required to execute.

Here is a sample:
# cat /usr/libexec/sorcery/augur.d/shared
HELP=$&quot;
shared  none    Display installed files owned by more than one spell&quot;

param(){ :;}

run(){
 find $INSTALL_LOGS -type f |
 xargs --max-lines=1024 cat |
 LC_ALL=C sort | uniq -d | files
}


Each augur command module
has a HELP variable that becomes part of the
# augur --help
summary
Each contain a param() function for providing command line parameter completion,
however the augur shared command does not support command line completion.
Each contains a run() function that executes the command.

This command will display files installed by more than one spell.
To learn what spells these files come from
then execute:

# augur shared | augur from

Some of the less frequently used commands are gone.
Some commands have new names.
Many have enhanced functionality.
Where with older augur one would have to write either:

# augur shared_spells
# augur shared | xargs augur from

Now the augur from command accepts either
command line parameters or stdin for input.
Several commands accept stdin input.

Bored yet?
Here is where the discussion becomes interesting.
Why have a modular augur?

So, SAs can write modules for augur, of course!

augur modules that SAs write go into
/usr/local/libexec/sorcery/augur.d/  instead of
/usr/libexec/sorcery/augur.d/

Just squeeze that /local/ in between /usr and /libexec
And that is where they go.

Speed is one benefit of modular augur.
However, another benefit is that bugs are localized
to the modular they exist in.
If a newly created module has a bug
then that bug will not adversely effect running

# augur easy
# augur newer
# augur sync
# augur update
# augur merge
# augur index

nor any of the other important augur commands.

For myself this keeps me from having to search through 64K
of source code looking for an unmatched '&quot;'
or other silly mistakes that I might mistake.

I am currently testing the improved modular augur.
The transition is about 90% complete.
Some of the larger functions still retain their
code in /usr/libexec/sorcery/augur instead of
having it exported to the augur module:
scry newer update sync are examples where
I will be taking much more time to export the
code to be absolutely certain that it does not break.

More than 50% of the requested sorcery modifications involve augur.
A modular augur will enable SAs to more quickly
obtain the exact augur commands that they desire
while without the risk of entirely breaking augur.
The most popular augur command modules can be
contributed back into sorcery
so that all Sorcerer SAs can use them.

In this way augur works much more like the cast + grimoire + spells
since a broken spell will not usually cause the sorcery tools to break.

So in summary this change grants the following boons:
more speed;
more SA configure-ability;
greater stability;
easier debug-ability.

Banes: none.

With more than 62 very functional augur command modules to start with
there will be a perfect example to copy and edit in order
to create the new augur command modules that SAs desire most.

Excited to write your first augur command module?
Expect the new modular augur to be ready for use
in the fourth week of June.
