<PRE>I have booted from USB flash drive before.
What feedback is desired?
See the install script for Sorcerer in the grimoire.
Basically only adjust /etc/lilo.conf and /etc/fstab
to properly address devices using UUIDs
and then it can boot from a flash device.

Returning to the initramfs discussion,
knowing exactly what to put on an initramfs is
both a simple and complex challenge.
I will skip the explanation and go straight to the interesting part.
How much can a precise initramfs save?

# ls -lah /boot/*/initrf
-rw------- 1 root root  42M 2008-08-05 06:02 /boot/2.6.25.6/initrf
-rw------- 1 root root  42M 2008-08-05 06:03 /boot/2.6.25.9/initrf
-rw------- 1 root root  42M 2008-08-05 06:03 /boot/2.6.26/initrf
-rw------- 1 root root 8.7M 2008-08-05 06:05 /boot/fast/initrf

It can save about 4/5th
However, any update that causes initramfs regeneration
causes the precise initrf to also go stale.
And the precise initrf can not be regenerated until after
a successful boot.
The precise initrf generation is fast enough since it
forms the cpio from the files already on the initramfs
which are already in RAM.

The bootable kernel called fast is merely a copy
of the default kernel booted at the time that
precise initrf was generated.
Therefore, if the box booted into the most recently installed kernel
then that will be generated as fast so that on the next boot
fast can be booted instead.

If gremlins infest the fast boot initrf and make it useless
then the SA can boot any of the other available kernels.
This way a box has both the fast road where you race
around the mountain at with the pedal floored
and also the scenic root where you can stop and get out of the
car to pick some flowers if the car develops an odd odor.

Unfortunately, the change comes with
an expected commensurate amount of complexity.
And it is of no great use to anyone who does not
reboot a box more than twice between kernel updates.

Although the banes outweigh the boons 4 to 1
it does go to show that a precise initramfs is possible
and that does boot faster.
I have only tested it on fixed disk.
On an pentium 233 MMX it saves about 10 seconds.
Not fast enough to notice.
However, when booting from flash drive
the savings may be more impressive when
compared to booting from fixed disk.
While it will not be as fast
it will not be nearly as slow as it was
since the fast/initrf would be 1/5th the size of a full initrf.

Overall an initrf of 9M to 13M is a very reasonable size
considering it contains no non-standard utilities such as uClibc + busybox.
About 1/3 of the size is used by modules.
Results on other boxes will vary depending upon
what is run during sysinit.
Perhaps an initramfs smaller than 6M is possible.
It surely is possible if the initrf is gzip compressed.
However, compressing such a small file that might
not be used is not worth the CPU cycles since the
creation of the fast initrf happens at the end of sysinit
and before runlevel execution begins.
Therefore, a delay there would be noticed.

I gziped -9

-rw------- 1 root root 8.7M 2008-08-05 06:05 /boot/fast/initrf

just to see.

-rw-------  1 root root 4.3M 2008-08-05 06:51 initrf.gz

Now that is a tiny initramfs.
Nearly a full magnitude smaller that the larger full uncompressed initramfs.
It is even usable on a modern embedded system
or vmware appliance,  ;) for you know who.

Also...
Even if it seemed like it would be great if they were all that small,
remember that a precise initramfs can only be generated for
the kernel that was booted when no /boot/fast existed during boot.
Therefore, the precise initramfs is determined and not conjectured.

Sorry if that seemed complex.
Hopefully, this compromise answers some questions
and provides additional functionality while maintaining
the fall back security blanket of the full initramfs should
the box have to be booted into it in order to deal with
hardware changes and software updates.
