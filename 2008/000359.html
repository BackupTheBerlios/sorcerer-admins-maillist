<PRE>The update should work okay.
kde 4.0 aught to work.
However, there are some issues.

When you login it might not play any sound.
Perhaps in ~/.xsession-errors it will print:
open_jack_plugin: Error: Failed to connect to JACK server
open_jack_plugin: (did you start 'jackd' server?)

Not sure if it is related.
No further information about that issue yet.

You may have on the desktop icons for home and trash with no image.
You can remove those icons or give them new pictures.
They are left over from kde 3.x

.xsession-errors may have errors about io-slave protocol for file not found.
The solution is:

$ rm -f ~/.kde/share/config/ksycoca
$ rm -r /var/tmp/kdecache-$USERNAME/ksyscoca
$ kbuildsycoca4

To be entirely certain kde 4.0 will work as expected you may want to
log out of kde
and entirely remove ~/.kde and /var/tmp/kdecache-$USERNAME
If they are missing and you login with kdm
then those directories will be created and properly filled.

If you invoke qjackctl it may not be able to start jackd
Reconfigure it to start jackd without real-time priority.
Then, it can start.

The requirement lists for kde 4.0 source tarballs are
more simple than kde 3.x
There are a few new requirements.
However, many old optional requirements are removed.

With the exception of qt-x11-opensource
kde 4.0 compiles faster than kde 3.x
autoconf, automake, libtool was removed.
They compile using cmake and make.
libtool was horribly inefficient.

arts is gone.
There was no arts release for kde 4.0
Perhaps kde can run without a sound server?
Perhaps it requires jackit.
It does have some support for jackit sound server.
I expect to learn more about this while using it.

Due to shared name space along with the convenience of a /usr installation
KDE 3.x and KDE 4 can not be concurrently installed.
Other distros may support this.
Sorcerer will not.

Many spells that require kdelibs and kdebase from version 3.x are now
broken, yet unmarked.
cast will not be able to compile them nor heal them.
Some of them already will enter the dispel queue upon # augur newer.
Some time will be required before all the spells requiring kde 3.x are
properly sorted.
If you update then you may have to do without some of them.

koffice for kde 4.0 is available as unstable software.
I am currently testing it.
In a day or two it will probably enter the grimoire.

Some other software in the grimoire with versions currently compatible
with kde 3
have newer and/or developmental/unstable versions available that are
compatible with kde 4.
The spells will be updated.
This will require some time.

KDE 4.0 has a somewhat slower heavier feel to the GUI than KDE 3.x
The K menu is initially confusing to navigate.
Click the left vertical column with the triangle pointing
to the left in order to return to the previous menu layer.
Right click the K menu icon and adjust properties
application launcher settings to increase the amount of items
that it will display on a menu in order to avoid having to scroll
up and down on the menu.  20 seems to be a good number.
