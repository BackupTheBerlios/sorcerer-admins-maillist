<PRE>A complete recompilation of the I/R should have eliminated
the potential for any remaining Athlon-XP optimized executables.
Again it should be suitable for i586 and newer compatible Intel
architecture 32 bit.

These first three improvements circumvent common SA mistakes.

1. Selecting a partition boot block for installing lilo
will automatically make that partition the only active
bootable partition on that device,

2. Selecting a partition's boot block for installing lilo
causes a confirmation to install a bootable MBR.

3. Partitions configured as part of a software RAID
will have their types changed to FDh.
Using partition type FDh and the information stored
in the partition header the Linux kernel can
auto-detect and activate the RAIDs
without an /etc/mdadm.conf configuration file.


The following have configuration support in the menu driven installer:

1. Software RAID ( man md; man mdadm for more info)

2. LVM2 (Logical Volume Managment 2, HowTo is available at <A HREF="http://tldp.org">http://tldp.org</A> )

3. LUKS encrypted devices, ( Linux User Key Setup, man cryptsetup 1.0.6 )

/ can be mounted on any of the 3 above block devices
instead of an ordinary partition.
However, those advanced configurations also required a dedicated
ext2 /boot partition of 256M to 1G.
A Software RAID or LVM2 Logical Volume can also have LUKS
encryption enabled upon it
And any of the above block devices can host either swaps or filesystems.

A notebook with a dedicated ext2 /boot partition
and a LUKS encrypted swap partition and LUKS encrypted / partition
would provide excellent security while powered down.
But the cost for that configuration is no suspend to disk.
And up to 8 simultaneous passwords for activating the encryption
can be added and revoked an infinite amount of times.

A LUKS encrypted device specified in /etc/fstab
that lacks the noauto option will cause a password prompt
during boot if the device hosts a filesystem and not a swap.
Encrypted swaps cause no password prompt during boot.



Here is what did not make it onto the new I/R:

SELinux support is still half baked.
It is probably just a couple of scripts
and hours of testing away from being complete.
However, work on complete SELinux support was suspended
in order to deliver this improved and bug fixed I/R
faster than humanly possible.

EVMS, similar to LVM2 since they both provide front ends
to configuring the the Linux kernel's device-mapper,
is also not included on the I/R.
EVMS is more complicated and more problematic to use than LVM2.


As usual please report bugs if you want fixes.
Please enjoy this finely honed Sorcerer Install/Rescue image.
