<PRE>I understand your dismay.
I pondered whether to make that decision for more than a month.
And yes it is a terrible inconvenience,
but less of an inconvenience than having a box break during
boot due to an old /etc/init.d/mount script falling short of
being forward compatible.

If it is a sufficiently large enough inconvenience
then we should discuss compromises and
alternatives that perhaps can accomplish the same goals,
but by a more agreeable method?

While on the subject of init-scripts...
The habit of copying and editing init-scripts
created an interesting and useful convenience.
Certain variables such as:
$NAME
$SERV
$OPTS
$PIDF
have become common to nearly all init-scripts.
Likewise certain functions are almost identical in most init scripts.
Consequently, init-scripts was updated to include sensible defaults
for functions such as:
status()
start()
stop()
restart()
try_restart()
help()
parse()

Therefore, many of the new init scripts contain a LSB section
a $NAME $SERV $PIDF definition
and finish off with a parse &quot;$@&quot;
Now that the average size of init-scripts is under 1K
writing them has never been easier.

This change does not break backward compatibility.
However, a change of this magnitude easily could.
It is fortunate that the init-scripts are such that they
can still evolve with the distribution instead of being
too sensitive to change.

Now back to the previous discussion.
You use custom init-scripts for NFS.
Just guessing, but could it be because the
current grimoire provided NFS init-scripts are inadequate?
Perhaps they could use some updating?
I mentioned in a recent email that the handling of NFS
probably should be changed.
portmap should probably either be made optional or obsolete.
Those types of changes do require changes be made to the NFS init-scripts.
Maybe you might want to provide some better more configurable
NFS init-script defaults?

Let us take a look at gmp, for example...
I recently added a configure() to it.
That way it asks the mouse protocol.
Then it asks the mouse device, and suggests /dev/psaux as the default.
Finally, during build() it modifies the gpm.d/init.d.on/gpm init-script
Then the modified gpm init-script is installed in /etc/init.d/
But it is the SA input values are saved in the spell config file.
That way every time gpm casts or updates it can correctly
modified the gpm init-script so that an init script appropraite
for the mouse configuration on that box is installed into /etc/init.d

Similar to gpm, the nfs-utils spell could probably ask the SA some questions.
Then, it could store those answers in the spell config file.
Finally, during build it could make appropriate changes to the init-scripts
in the grimoire before they are installed into /etc/init.d
In that fashion NFS is made more customizable.
However, at the same time the scripts installed into /etc/init.d/
will not require SA customization.

My supposition is that with the use of better spells
and better init-scripts from the grimoire
that the SA can probably achieve the level of customization
that the SA wans without having to customized init-scripts
after they are installed into /etc/init.d/
Now I do not expect that conjecture to be 100% correct.
Naturally, there will remain less than 1% of init-scripts
where a SA will definitely have to create a custom spell
in order to have a custom init-script installed.
However, if we put in a good effort into revising the spells
in the grimoire that involve init-scripts
then we can minimize the inconvenience.
In the long run maybe answering a few spell configuration questions
would be even easier for a SA than editing init-scripts?
