/sbin/sinstall does not run lilo.
That is correct.
When the initramfs is cast in the chrooted to the real root filesystem
that creates the required initramfs images and installs lilo.
lilo can not be installed without first generating initramfs images.
/sbin/sinstall does not generate initramfs images.
Instead it casts spells while chrooted to the real root filesystem
and those spells do the work.
Maintaining such code in more than one location is hazardous
if they should go out of sync.

&gt;<i> Could you look current I/R .iso, i mean this:

Sure, I am trying to prepare for a new I/R release in December.
I will do full installation and boot testing on them as I usual do.
The last I/Rs might have been merely updates and no fully tested.
But I was feeling confident that they should have worked since
I made not changes to the sinstall code.
If a SA does not do the compilation step as part of the installation
then the SA will have to manually chroot to /media/root/
and fix /etc/lilo.conf.head /etc/lilo.conf and
and then run init-scripts such as /etc/init.d/initramfs
in order to generate the initramfs images and have lilo install
to the boot block or MBR.

Was it possible that some important step was skipped?
Or does the target disk have an old lilo in the MBR and
the new lilo in a partition boot block?
Or does the new disk not have a bootable MBR installed
and the SA did not select to have ms-sys install a bootable MBR?

Many failures to boot after installation are due to something unexpected
about the MBR or lilo location installation or that the boot sector that
contains lilo is not properly marked as bootable in the partition table.
There is probably between 6 and 12 small tiny little things that I almost
never think about which could cause a new installation to be unbootable.
And they are not directly related to any bugs in the sinstall program,
but rather occur because the sinstall script permits SAs so much freedom
about how Sorcerer can be installed instead of trying to do a
&quot;no questions asked every box should be the same&quot; style installation.

I might also add in that certain filesystems are unsuitable for use
for installing lilo into the boot block of the partition because the file
system will not automatically reserve that space.
I tend to use only ext2 and ext3
and therefore, do not know which filesystems to beware.

Another possible solution is to try installing from older I/Rs
Newer is usually better, but older are still available for download.
