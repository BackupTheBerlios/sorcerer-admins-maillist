<PRE>Hmm... having a lag of &gt; 0 just delays the inevitable.

Maybe calling it sorcerer-stable and grimoire stable is throwing you off a
little.

Can't we just go through a period of bug hunting and once we are satisfied
that we got every one we can find we say: &quot;Right, the grimoire of 2008-09-10
is about as stable as we can get it.&quot;
We can either then recommend that people who want a nice and stable
experience can then hold their grimoire at that version until we announce a
new stable one some six months later. Or, we can look at a way of having
Sorcerer hold it's grimoire and sorcerer versions at the stable version and
still check to see if there is a new stable version.

No contrib grimoire. We all have seen how successful that was. It's too much
work for too little gain. Just a date in time where we work towards fixing
bugs and hold off putting in new features. Once we are happy that all the
bugs have been squased, at the very least announce the date so that the
people that want a stable experience can update.

The rest of us at lag 0 will have some more fun seeing just how far we can
push bash and spells. Once we have implemented a few new features, we go bug
hunting again, then announce that bugs have been ironed out, all the stable
people can now update.

</I>&gt;<i> However, I do have full sympathy for the SA.
</I>&gt;<i> That is why sorcery has the excellent progress support
</I>&gt;<i> so that SAs can control available and installed spell versions.
</I>&gt;<i> And also Sorcerer boxes heal up after library updates.
</I>&gt;<i> This functionality permits SAs to change installed versions
</I>&gt;<i> of libraries more easily than any other distro that I have seen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In all these issues I like to find a compromise.
</I>&gt;<i> Now a few of you want a ?stable? grimoire.
</I>&gt;<i> What you desire is not entirely impossible nor easily accomplished.
</I>&gt;<i> If you make it and roll a tarball for it then it can be introduced as
</I>&gt;<i> a spell into
</I>&gt;<i> both grimoires to replace the main grimoire spell.
</I>&gt;<i> The catch is that I will consider such a grimoire to be a contrib grimoire.
</I>&gt;<i> As such I will not personally update it nor check it.
</I>&gt;<i> Those grimoire gurus will have complete autonomy over their grimoire
</I>&gt;<i> and will be responsible for the unpleasant and boring task of importing
</I>&gt;<i> spells from the official grimoire after I update them such as spells for
</I>&gt;<i> initramfs, init-scripts, etc...
</I>&gt;<i> If that does not happen
</I>&gt;<i> then the contrib grimoire will eventually
</I>&gt;<i> become something different than was intended.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What it amounts to is a great deal of effort for very little gain.
</I>&gt;<i> If you want an installed grimoire full of old spells then just
</I>&gt;<i> set the LAG variable to 30
</I>&gt;<i> That will grant you a 30 day lag on updates.
</I>&gt;<i> That way a SA concerned about the mysql update can adjust progress
</I>&gt;<i> on the mysql spell long before that grimoire is destined to arrive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently almost all Sorcerer boxes receive LAG=1.
</I>&gt;<i> My boxes run LAG=0.
</I>&gt;<i> Production boxes should probably run LAG=7
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is my former compromise for maintaining
</I>&gt;<i> a balance between security, updates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please keep in mind that older != stable
</I>&gt;<i> More often newer software is more stable
</I>&gt;<i> and has less bugs than older versions.
</I>&gt;<i> That is why we tend to make such a big fuss
</I>&gt;<i> when some newer version of software is
</I>&gt;<i> less than what we expect.
</I>&gt;<i> The bugs appearance and elimination of bugs is nearly a sinus wave
</I>&gt;<i> that tends to diminish in magnitude as projects become older.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please consider this carefully and create a table that evaluates
</I>&gt;<i> the boons and banes of creating a ?stable? grimoire.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise you may end up with a pile of work larger than any
</I>&gt;<i> one person can accomplish that provides less benefit than expected,
</I>&gt;<i> and unanticipated problems.
