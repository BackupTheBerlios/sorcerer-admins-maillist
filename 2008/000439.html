<PRE>Most of the specifications I have read regarding
runlevels 2 and 4 is that they are &quot;experimental&quot;
Consequently, we put them to good use with Sorcerer.
2 is the same as runlevel 3, except parallelization.
4 is the same as runlevel 5, except parallelization.
Runlevels 2 and 4 allow many of the services to
be started concurrently which can in many cases
expedite the booting process of a box.
However, it destroys the readability and
probability of successfully debugging the
runlevel log which would be either
/etc/init.d/log.d/runlevel.2 or
/etc/init.d/log.d/runlevel.4

The combination of runlevel 4 + bootblaze makes
for nearly the fastest possible boot time for a workstation.
That is because it puts nearly constant stress on the fixed
disk to provide data even before it is required by programs.

During boot the disk is always the most signifigant
bottlneck that keeps booting from happening
nearly without delay.
Therefore, if booting is unexpectedly slow
perhaps the best solution is to give sorcery-defrag a cast.

Having sysinit execute from initramfs when booting with
linux-modular and initramfs installed has both advantages
and disadvantages.
First, it has the advantage of a fast load time with all the
required modules and files and data being loaded into RAM
before the kernel begins execution.
However, sysinit always executes linearly.
And the udevsettle, on some boxes, can cause a
significant wait while udev cold plugs modules and
sets up device nodes in /dev
It is unfortunate that this wait must be obeyed,
but if the required device node in /dev does not exist
then there really is no way to fsck and mount filesystems.
Fortunately, since Sorcerer boxes use udev and not hotplug,
the cold plugging on Sorcerer happens as fast as it would on
any other modern Linux kernel based operating system.

It is known that the definition of runlevels in /etc/inittab
for older installations of Sorcerer is incorrect.
It should look like:

# 0: halt
# 1: sequential init
# 2: parallel   init + multi-user + networking
# 3: sequential init + multi-user + networking
# 4: parallel   init + multi-user + networking + GUI login
# 5: sequential init + multi-user + networking + GUI login
# 6: reboot

Please update /etc/inittab on deployed boxes
if the definition of the runlevels is not already memorized.
sorcery will not automatically update
comments in /etc/inittab on deployed boxes.

Hope that helps bring everyone up to speed about what
the runlevels do on Sorcerer.
I apologize for the confusion.
Years ago before the first major revision of the runlevels
runlevels 2 and 4 were not explicitly defined.
It is probable that they were not used for anything.

Although runlevels 7 through 9 are not defined
it is possible that in the future that they could be used.
Anyone have any ideas what they should do?

At the time parallel execution of runlevel init-scripts became
available, that functionality was considered experimental.
And therefore it belonged on runlevels 2 and 4.
However, now it is stable and it is permanently defined.
Having clear definitions forrunlevels 0 through 6
seems prudent before moving onward to 7 through 9.

Runlevels 0 1 3 5 6 will probably exactly the same across
LSB compliant distributions.
However, I do not know if other distros use 2 and 4 for
parallel execution of init-scripts.
Might just be a Sorcerer thing?
Anyone know what other distros use for 2 and 4?
