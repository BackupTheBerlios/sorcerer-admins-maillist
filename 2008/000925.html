&gt;<i> &gt; Pretty sure initramfs does not cast at all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm, i might now suspect chroot casting does not work at current I/R 
</I>.iso.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The none of the chrooted casting worked then?
</I>
Hmm, i think it did not cast anything at any point. I partitioned disk, 
did format partitions, etc. and transfer files, but i dont recall it did 
any cast operations, so that why i suspect chroot cast did not worked (and 
because i did try it manually, chroot /media/root/, and it did not find 
shell, or something. If i recall right, there was indeed no shell at 
/bin...

&gt;<i> That is a bit of a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet it will have to wait until I roll the next I/Rs
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If a SA does not do the compilation step as part of the installation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; then the SA will have to manually chroot to /media/root/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm, i think i did try to chroot to /media/root/ but it did not 
</I>worked.
&gt;<i> &gt; So perhaps transfer is to blame?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well if transferring did not work then chroot building would not work,
</I>&gt;<i> however there would also probably be nothing installed.
</I>&gt;<i> How did you make it work with nothing installed?
</I>&gt;<i> Did you do a manual installation?
</I>
It did transfer files ok, atleast it did not report any errors (or i did 
not see any errors atleast) and when i did goto /media/root/ it was full 
of files/directories, looked ok. Except there was no any point 
/etc/lilo.conf, only those lilo.conf.head, etc, so i manually made 
lilo.conf using them and manually runned lilo command, it has parameter to 
use directory as root directory so it did not needed chrooting.

&gt;<i> Evert gave me extensive input for what he wants to see in the next
</I>&gt;<i> menu driven I/R installer.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, I have to do full testing on it anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> It is nearly a one menu design.
</I>&gt;<i> It feels a bit overwhelming to me,
</I>&gt;<i> but we shall see if it works or not.
</I>&gt;<i> Evert did not like the idea of having to leave the disk menu
</I>&gt;<i> with partitions mounted in order to goto the compile menu.
</I>&gt;<i> It was perhaps counter intuitive?
</I>
Perhaps more wizard like could be better? Like all others distros does 
installer, they are wizard like. That might be better approach than 
manually selecting menus, etc. thats confusing.
 
&gt;<i> I miss the days when I had enough CPU power to grind out I/Rs
</I>&gt;<i> one day after the next if a bad mistake was made.
</I>&gt;<i> But there was no x86_64 port back then.
</I>
Well just wait when i get my new server online so we can virtualize 
devboxes, allthough testing I/R might be difficult to handle unless i make 
you an access to main linux where virtual servers are runned/created. 
Think i will use KVM, instead Xen. 
I managed to get HDD drivers yesterday, 3 * 750GB SATA 2 drivers, just 
testing them on software raid, RAID5, sequential read speed about 
250MB/sec (thats bytes not bits) at beginning part and end part gives 
about 100MB/sec. Will test also RAID10... But with RAID5 i will get 1.5TB 
space...
