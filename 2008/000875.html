<PRE>Interesting that you should ask.
There are two types of backward compatibility with glibc.
First, there is the limit to how far old a linux kernel it will support.
Second, there is a limit to how far old it will support running an
ELF executable that was linked with an older version of glibc.

The second is easier to control.
The first is more difficult.
When compiling glibc I tried newer kernel headers.
However the newer kernel headers have a problem
that fails glibc compilation.
I could try to fix the newer linux kernel headers,
but for the moment it is easier to simply use the older headers that work.

linux and glibc developers are not quite in agreement about
the using of linux kernel headers.
Obviously, gcc requires them.
But linux developers do not want anyone writing software that
relies upon linux kernel headers.

However, to set the the glibc linux support to a require
a more recent kernel also requires more recent linux kernel headers.
So that will probably remain as is for a while until there are newer
linux kernel headers that do not error glibc compilation.

In order to reduce backward compatibility for old glibc ABI one would use

  --enable-oldest-abi=ABI configure the oldest ABI supported [e.g. 2.2]
                          [default=glibc default]

The current glibc spell does not have that, for obvious reasons.
However, a less obvious reason is that sometimes glibc does not
finish compilation if that configure parameter is given.
That may be a bug in older glibc.
I do not know if it still exists.

Oddly a glibc can be built without versioning information.
It is described in the glibc FAQ as 1.17

By omitting versioning information a very streamlined small glibc
could be built.
It would be a bit like uClibc which is designed to be small and not provide
backward compatibility.
Therefore, while good for uClibc, omitting versioning information from glibc
would be bad, very bad.

I investigated uClibc for a while because it is very fast and small.
Yes it even supports i18n
If it ever became a decent drop in replacement for glibc
then it would be fun to use.
Perhaps even a hybrid box that has both glibc and uClibc can be created.
With a little extra work some software can be made to work with uClibc
in order to gain the benefits of increased speed and reduced size.

But most Sorcerer SAs are looking for stability and ease.
With as entrenched as glibc is it is easier to use only glibc.

In the past some people interested
in performance used something called the Hurd kernel.
Perhaps a port of Debian using the Hurd Mach kernel still exists.
Of course do not expect to run anything on such a box unless
it is properly patches for hurd and compiled for hurd.
Other than that I know nothing more about hurd.

As far as I can tell about C libraries.
uClibc is among the fastest.
glibc is not even a close comparison.
However, buying a faster computer is easily faster than changing libc.

One last note...
If I had to today figure out what version of linux headers
to use to compile glibc without my prior experience
then I would probably upset myself over how
complex and absurd it all is.
