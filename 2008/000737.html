<PRE>I used this method to make backups, about a decade ago.
However, it is still just as applicable today in order to start
a new Sorcerer box, using an deployed Sorcerer box as a reference.
And it is a good compromise between speed and simplicity.

Boot the new box with the I/R
Start networking.
Create filesystems.
Mount filesystems.

Using ssh, with compression level 9 enabled,
start an invocation of tar on the source box that outputs to stdout.
Because it is invoked through ssh the output goes straight over ssh
to the destination computer.
pipe the output of ssh on the destination computer into tar
and specify the new filesystems as the destination.

By doing this tar is invoked on the source computer to gather files
and that ?tarball? is sent streaming to the destination computer were
it is unpacked as fast as it is created.
ssh handles the compression to use both CPUs to deliver more data
over the network.

Of course to do backups I would merely pipe the output of tar on the
destination computer into a &gt; something.tar.gz
But by piping output into tar a filesystem can be loaded rapidly.

With a fast enough network this method for deploying a new box
from an old box has a great combination of speed and simplicity.
There is no initial preparation work.
No new ISO9660 images must be made.
No need to save tarballs to disk.

Of course there are other methods:
dd can be used to mirror local partitions;
cp can be used locally;
cp can be used with NFS;
rsync can be used locally or networked;
scp alone can be used or tried
( but scp will not preserve ownership/mode, and probably can not
transfer nodes );
etc...

There are yet more methods.
Subsequent deployments of Sorcerer is not limited by Sorcerer.
As expected SA knowledge determines what can be done.

Better stocked I/Rs would be nice, if I had the CPU power to create them.
But eventually even using 7za compression the 650M limit would be encountered.
And I know of at least two SA that do not want to download a 650M I/R

Yet a SA could create a new ideal deployment of Sorcerer in a chrooted
filesystem
on an already deployed box.
Then using the above method that new deployment can be transferred from the
host computer to the target computer via the network ssh and tar.
This is probably the among the fastest and easiest
method to achieve the exact deployment desired.
