It is many CPU cycles.
Unfortunately, there is no estimate on compiling the entire grimoire.
Even the amount of time required to compile individual spells is not
entirely known because it depends on unknown factors such as
the overall power of the box, the filesystem type, the additional load,
and of course which optional requirements are selected for spells.

</I>
Could yes, should maybe not.
The dev boxes should have the same configuration as the production boxes
to ensure that the compilation success on the production boxes is
commensurate with compilation success on the dev boxes.
However, if a dev box has spare CPU cycles
then it can be used to compile Sorcerer chrooted
and have an entirely different loadout of software.
In this fashion one dev box can exist and be tested
for all the production boxes.
However, that might or could still cut corners a bit since
services should also run on a dev box so that the SA can
also check to see how the webserver continues to run or crash
following updates, etc...

Now that virtual machine emulation is becoming more trivial with
CPU extensions on more modern CPUs
One physical dev box can stand be used more easily to test
many production boxes.

&gt;<i> It can be difficult to run augur sync on servers where you have ancient

</I>
I really am trying to do what I can about that.
The sorcery spell for example has lines it it such as:

    stable photon-20081128-1 photon-20081121-0
[[ -z $VERSION ]] &amp;&amp;
 VERSION=( photon-20081128-1 )
       url <A HREF="http://sorcerer.silverice.org/download/sorcery/">http://sorcerer.silverice.org/download/sorcery/</A>
       URL=<A HREF="http://sorcerer.silverice.org/download/sorcery/">http://sorcerer.silverice.org/download/sorcery/</A>
    source sorcery-$VERSION.tar.bz2
    SOURCE=sorcery-$VERSION.tar.bz2

That way boxes updating from a sorcery so old that it does not
support the function driven grimoire can sitll have VERSION URL and SOURCE
set correctly for being able to download the newer sorcery.
But eventually even that should be dropped.
I was thinking about dropping it sometime in December.
Oh look, it is December already.

The more backward compatibility that I try to maintain
the more strange unexpected problems can become.


&gt;<i> So to me transition between sorcerer versions is important.
</I>
Leaping sorcery more than 3 months at a time is hazardous.
The larger the leap the larger the risk.

Chances are glibc does not compile at the moment.
It is probably due to the update of some other software
that is used during glibc compilation.
So if a box is so old that it leaps up a new sorcery and
a new glibc then chances are the new glibc might not compile.
It is on my extremely long list of things todo
to check and fix glibc compilation.

Sorcerer is optimal for doing monthly updates.
Even 3 month updates provides reasonable performance.
But long leaps encounter unanticipated problems because
there is not a Sorcerer box doing regular full compilations
of the grimoire to check if updates cause instability with
software that previously compiled fine.

&gt;<i> Like if i have one year old server
</I>&gt;<i> not in sync and i would like to sync it then i would like to be sure its
</I>&gt;<i> going to be ok todo. So i tend to freeze my versions quite an often and like
</I>&gt;<i> to have more support on that. There is &quot;augur progress&quot; and its good to have
</I>&gt;<i> after so long time, just wondering how to bring my machines to up to date
</I>&gt;<i> and convert them to use augur progress on easy way.
</I>
The conversion code is probably still in the sorcery spell.
But other code may not still be there or it may be commented out.
The ldd or elf logs of the older boxes may be in an old format
that either should be converted to the new format or will not
work properly at all and simply be ignored.
Therefore, such boxes may update software yet not automatically
detect and repair spells that have ELF breaks.

Please take a good look at the sorcery spells post_install and
see if there is something in there that looks as if it should be
re-enabled for the update of your boxes.
Over the course of a year or maybe longer....
1. single column ldd logs became single column elf logs.
2. later single column elf logs became dual column elf logs.
3. later dual column elf logs became 3 column elf logs.
Sometime or another id logs entirely vanished.
And of course other changes have happened.
Logs that were previously kept in /etc/sorcery/log/
have been moved to /var/log/sorcery/
because those logs can be safely removed withot
disrupting sorcery's performance.

And one of the larger changes of 2008 was the fixing of
kde3 to install in /opt/kde3 and the introduction of kde4
to install in /opt/kde4
Also Sorcerer gained much better init-scripts and init-script handling
and awesome support for booting from initramfs.

2008 was supposed to be a sleepy year at first,
but instead everything changed.
Even sorcery changed a great deal with the introduction of
modularized methods for cast leech and especially augur.


&gt;<i> Could it be also possible to split security related information out from
</I>&gt;<i> full sync?
</I>
Only if spell format was set in stone.
And it is not.
The format for spells is always open for improvement.

&gt;<i> If you are admin you might want to know if there are security
</I>&gt;<i> related updates available in grimoire. Sort of process where it would
</I>&gt;<i> compare installed versions against secure version progress, &quot;augur
</I>&gt;<i> newer_secure&quot; ?
</I>
One can always download a newer grimoire and grep
for the word security and see.
There were plenty of security updates in 2008.
I understand this a big pain.

However, what was originally intended is for SAs to continue
syncing on a regular basis and to control what software was updated
by using hold and sold.
Now it is intended that boxes regular sync
and that the update of installed software is controlled using version progress.
See # augur help progress
If a box is not synced then many benefits are lost.
