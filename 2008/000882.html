<PRE>Sorcerer is not bleeding edge by default.
That is what the unstable versions in spells are for.
And while I am on the defensive,
the bug in mysql were not put there by your's truly
nor did I decide that 5.1.30 was stable.
Those were decisions made by mysql software authors.

However, I do have full sympathy for the SA.
That is why sorcery has the excellent progress support
so that SAs can control available and installed spell versions.
And also Sorcerer boxes heal up after library updates.
This functionality permits SAs to change installed versions
of libraries more easily than any other distro that I have seen.

In all these issues I like to find a compromise.
Now a few of you want a ?stable? grimoire.
What you desire is not entirely impossible nor easily accomplished.
If you make it and roll a tarball for it then it can be introduced as
a spell into
both grimoires to replace the main grimoire spell.
The catch is that I will consider such a grimoire to be a contrib grimoire.
As such I will not personally update it nor check it.
Those grimoire gurus will have complete autonomy over their grimoire
and will be responsible for the unpleasant and boring task of importing
spells from the official grimoire after I update them such as spells for
initramfs, init-scripts, etc...
If that does not happen
then the contrib grimoire will eventually
become something different than was intended.

What it amounts to is a great deal of effort for very little gain.
If you want an installed grimoire full of old spells then just
set the LAG variable to 30
That will grant you a 30 day lag on updates.
That way a SA concerned about the mysql update can adjust progress
on the mysql spell long before that grimoire is destined to arrive.

Currently almost all Sorcerer boxes receive LAG=1.
My boxes run LAG=0.
Production boxes should probably run LAG=7

That is my former compromise for maintaining
a balance between security, updates.

Please keep in mind that older != stable
More often newer software is more stable
and has less bugs than older versions.
That is why we tend to make such a big fuss
when some newer version of software is
less than what we expect.
The bugs appearance and elimination of bugs is nearly a sinus wave
that tends to diminish in magnitude as projects become older.

Please consider this carefully and create a table that evaluates
the boons and banes of creating a ?stable? grimoire.
Otherwise you may end up with a pile of work larger than any
one person can accomplish that provides less benefit than expected,
and unanticipated problems.
