<PRE>Actually, I remember the sort of confusion Mr. Antonie Chassagnard is feeling.
Sorcerer has over 3000 software programs and someone new
to this side of free software would not know which one to install or why.

One of the best places to get started is at
<A HREF="http://tldp.org">http://tldp.org</A>
When we want to know how to do something
we all go read a how to at the linux documentation project website.

One of the first two things you will want to do is probably to install
X and proper video drivers,
configure X,
and be able to start it using a window manager such as
kde-v4 or gnome.

Otherwise you will be using the linux consoles mostly.
And using consoles only makes for a boring workstation.
Besides, there are few if any good games that can be played on the
linux console.
Installing X and and a window manager such as KDE will
an experience that is more like the M$ Windoze GUI experience.

Sorcerer only supports one X server at the moment.
It is called xorg.

To install xorg and kde-v4
simply:

# cast xorg kde-v4

It will ask menu after menu after menu of questions.
Generally, if something is omitted from being installed
then it can be installed later.

Executing lshw will tell a bit about what hardware is installed.
lspci will print a list of pci devices and probably also the graphics card.
Unless you prefer the svga graphics then selecting the optimal
graphics drivers for X is advise.
If confused, just select and install all of them.

There are a few ways to create
/etc/X11/xorg.conf
That is the configuration file for the X server.
The X server provides the graphic desktop.
Configuring the X server enables selecting of
video resolution modes, color depth, input devices, etc...
I definitely advise finding a howto about it at the tldp.
However, if all those video drivers are installed then
# X -configure
will probe for devices and write a xorg.conf file.
It will probably have to be moved to to /etc/X11/
and edited before it can be used.

Due to recent changes in xorg-server
it may be worth adding to the section of
&quot;ServerFlags&quot;
the line:
Option &quot;AllowEmptyInput&quot; &quot;false&quot;

That way it will probably properly detect keyboard and mouse.

If you have a NVIDIA or ATI based graphics then
both the pre-compiled drivers by those companies
are supplied  by additional spells:
NVIDIA-Linux-x86
ati-driver-installer
Install them using cast.
However, they must be properly configured for use in /etc/X11/xorg.conf

I will not joke about how difficult it is for someone new to create
a decent /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Attached is a sample xorg.conf one I use on a box with i810 graphics.

manual pages describe plenty.
# man xorg.conf

That explains a considerable amount about xorg.conf

# man X

That explains command line parameters for X which
might be useful or might not.

Each individual spell for graphics drivers also installs manual pages.
Here is an easy way to find them...

# augur installed | grep xf86-video | while read; do augur install
$REPLY; done | grep /man/

/usr/share/man/man4
/usr/share/man/man4/i810.4
/usr/share/man/man4/intel.4
/usr/share/man/man4
/usr/share/man/man4/vesa.4

On my test box I currently, only have xf86-video-intel and
xf86-video-vesa installed.
And that provides a couple of manual pages:

i810
intel

As you can see from the above command that
I typed in order to display the manual pages
a SAs ability to write BASH commands is very
useful with Sorcerer.

Okay, so setting up X is no fun.
But the compilation of it will be fast.

On the other hand setting up kde-v4 is fun.
However, the compilation of kde-v4 is very slow.
It is also a very large download.

Once the X server is set up properly and works
then I definitely recommend starting the box
with a graphical login provided by kdm-v4.

chmod 700 /etc/init.d/kdm-v4

Then edit /etc/inittab and set the default runlevel to 5
The first line probably reads:

id:3:initdefault:
Change it to
id:5:initdefault:

# Runlevels
# 0: halt
# 1: sequential init
# 2: parallel   init + multi-user + networking
# 3: sequential init + multi-user + networking
# 4: parallel   init + multi-user + networking + GUI login
# 5: sequential init + multi-user + networking + GUI login
# 6: reboot

That basically describes runlevels.
runlevels 1 through 5 are valid selections for default runlevels.

If X is not working properly and the box reboots to runlevel 5
you may have to ssh into the box to repair it unless
it responds to ctrl-alt-F1 or ctrl-alt-backspace
in order to return to a virtual console.

Rumor has it that X might start and work properly without
a /etc/X11/xorg.conf
I have not tested it.
Even if it does work /etc/X11/xorg.conf is required to use
factory supplied pre-compiled drivers for ATI and NVIDIA graphics cards.

After X is working.
And after KDE or some other window manager is installed
then select plenty of fun software to install and run.
The select and add menus in sorcery are good for starters.
Or you can find spells using augur.

First, please read the augur help screen

# augur

Then for additional help on a command type

# augur help command_name

and replace command_name with the name of the command to display help for.


Each distro has thousands of software available to install.
However, unlike many distros Sorcerer starts out with
nearly the minimal amount of software installed.
Uhm, actually, in recent years that has changed a little.
Your base installation of Sorcerer probably includes xorg
and all the xorg video drivers, but does not include
/etc/X11/xorg.conf
That still has to be generated appropriately for the installed
graphics hardware and desired video resolution mode.

However, to regress to what I started to say before...
Many other distros come with a tremendous amount of
pre-compiled software installed and ready for you to use.
Sorcerer comes with a more minimal loadout primarily because
senior level SAs will know what additional software that they
want installed and would not want to have to untangle and
uninstall a mount of software they do not require first.

However, in recent years Sorcerer base installation has become a compromise.
It has a nearly complete xorg, but no window big desktop environment.
The default window manager that comes with xorg is twm
Yes that is short for The Window Manager.
Ha, I did not even bother to include it on the I/R
I just checked.
Anyway, nobody actually uses twm except for testing.
But if you wanted a very light weight window manager just to test
then you could install twm.

Although I can not say the following with confidence.
But since Sorcerer is designed for senior level SAs
Sorcerer might be the worst distribution for someone
new to Linux/POSIX/UNIX to try first.
But even so you would not be the first person to have
their first and successful POSIX experience using Sorcerer.

Once you get the hang of it, you might decide it is fun.
But like I mentioned previously...
There are no wizards in Sorcerer.
Therefore, figuring out how to do something depends
largely on a SA's BASH skill,
willingness to find and read manual and info pages,
and willingness to find and read HowTos and FAQs
at the linux documentation project

But since you did manage to get Sorcerer installed and booted
that demonstrates that you already seem to have the required
amounts of skill and tenacity.
What person lacks in one can always be suplemented  by the other.  :)

After you have X set up and a window manager such as
gnome or kde-v3 or kde-v4 installed and usable
then you may want to tell us what the box is for on the
email list and SAs can tell you about their favorite software for doing that.
Even thought the grimoire contains over 3000 spells
we probably only use about 1000 spells per box.
Less than 5% of the spells in the grimoire are currently
broke and will not compile and we are unaware of them.
If you encounter something that you want and need fixed
please post it on the email list.
The more you can tell us about it the faster we can fix it.  :)

Because Sorcerer seamlessly migrates from past to present to future
we encounter a few ripples of instability that cause a few breaks
from time to time.
Therefore, it is often easier to maintain
a deployed Sorcerer box than it is to initially deploy it.
But with a bit of luck hopefully you will be able to install
the first 800 so spells without encountering a single compile error.
Good luck.
