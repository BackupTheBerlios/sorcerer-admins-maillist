<PRE>Sorry, I have not caught up reading email
and I should have mentioned this potential plan before,
but I was so distracted.

The nice aspect about implementing progress is that it can be easily extended.

Instead of just:

unstable
stable
secure

We can have:

unstable
latest
stable
secure

That way the latest stable versions can go into latest instead of stable.
However, if that means that stable becomes a lagged progress then
at sometime someone has to decide when an available version of software
should be promoted from latest to stable.

The advantages of this method is that it involves only one grimoire,
and requires relatively little effort compared to other methods,
and and testing/adding new versions to the latest category would
continue to be only my burden.
Also this plan does not delay nor hinder security updates
when such updates are made to stable/secure/latest all at the same time.
However, someone still has to test and decide when to promote from
latest to stable.

This type of plan can be integrated also with the 2nd of my previously
mentioned plans.
Therefore, the days of the month when versions can be added to latest
and stable can be restricted.
Overall we could end up doing more work to try to create a more
?stable? grimoire
and it might become more ?stable? or it might not.
