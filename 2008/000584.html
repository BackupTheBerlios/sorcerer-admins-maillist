<PRE>Networking comes in more flavors than soylent green.
But at least the method of &quot;try them until one is successful&quot;
seems to be a rational approach to a box that can use
different networks at different times.

Since that is the norm I might yet make it so using menus.
That way even a single network connection modified template
would have to exist in the a network group instead of
residing directly in /etc/networks.d/

Possible arrangement on disk:

/etc/networks.d/groups/[00.99]/
/etc/networks.d/connections/

Completed templates go into /etc/networks.d/connections/
Within /etc/networks.d/groups/$NUM/
go symbolic links that point to files in
/etc/networks.d/connections/
that belong to the group $NUM

Such a layout allows for up to 100 network groups
with connections that can belong to one any or all of those groups.

The rule would be that for a networking group to be successful
that all entries must raise successfully.

For example
Group/Network

00/A
00/B
01/A

Starting with network group 00 both A and B must raise.
If they do not raise then try group 01
In group 01 A must raise.

In the above example network B may be considered
optional while network A is mandatory.

This fashion allows some flexibility.
For networks within a group success is &quot;AND&quot;

Complex network topology may require using
more than a few groups in order achieve
the desired &quot;and&quot; &quot;or&quot; arrangement of network connections.

Also I can support this new design while still first support
the old design of checking for files within /etc/networks.d/
Therefore, it could achieve forward progress while
maintaining backward compatibility.
But it makes the /etc/init.d/networks script longer.

Is this a good design for guiding SAs into perceiving networking
configuration in a useful fashion?
Or is this paradigm box too cramped and tiny?

I am not entirely determined that this is a good design.
Please suggest modifications.
For now I will add it to my todo list as something
to give further consideration.

Anyone want to write more networking templates?
