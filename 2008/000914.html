<PRE>What is estimate to build whole world with 2 or 4 CPU cores (Q6600) and 1 
or 2 GB RAM? 
Just thinking when we get buildboxes would be better to build eg. whole 
world weekly/dayly/monthly and of course we need to build both 32-bit and 
64-bit versions. Thats a lot of CPU cycles there. 

I actually do run several Sorcerer based servers on production here, SMTP 
gateways, Reverse proxy servers, Web servers, Repository servers, etc you 
name it. 
So on those boxes i like stability (=if its working i dont have urge to 
update it, perhaps couple times a year only at most) and security fixes 
but on other hand got couple dev boxes too where i could update daily or 
weekly. 

It can be difficult to run augur sync on servers where you have ancient 
version of sorcery tools and ancient grimoire, so what i would like to 
have is also that we support better server environments too, like it would 
be nice to maintain sorcerer infrastructure on up-to-date on those boxes 
but perhaps i like to run old versions if they do run ok, i dont have 
always need to run latest versions but of course security fixes i like to 
run to production more often if needed and they are available. So to me 
transition between sorcerer versions is important. Like if i have one year 
old server not in sync and i would like to sync it then i would like to be 
sure its going to be ok todo. So i tend to freeze my versions quite an 
often and like to have more support on that. There is &quot;augur progress&quot; and 
its good to have after so long time, just wondering how to bring my 
machines to up to date and convert them to use augur progress on easy 
way...

Could it be also possible to split security related information out from 
full sync? If you are admin you might want to know if there are security 
related updates available in grimoire. Sort of process where it would 
compare installed versions against secure version progress, &quot;augur 
newer_secure&quot; ?
