Too bad their online demo is broken.
I remember now in the distant past I did use
something on a web page that produced mode lines.
Maybe it was that?
Should we write a spell for it?
Seems unfortunate that it should require X.


&gt;<i> Definatly - I know that a redhat box has utilities for reconfiguring
</I>&gt;<i> X's resolution...on the fly without restart?
</I>&gt;<i> and the nvidia-settings application can do it ( though that is a
</I>&gt;<i> specific target)
</I>
No.  Not resolution.
Color depth.
8, 16, 24, 32 bit


&gt;&gt;<i> 1920x1200 on a notebook?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Impressive resolution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But pixiels would be more tiny than I can see.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually you'd be surprized - deffault X xterm's are using their
</I>&gt;<i> common single-pixel font and it's way readable :)
</I>
I would expect it to be good for anti-aliasing.
anti-aliasing is supposed to make fonts in lower resolution look more detailed.
However, it always seems more difficult to read.
However, higher resolutions with anti-aliasing aught to look better.
However, I might still prefer high resolution non anti-aliased fonts instead.
I have never been displeased with the blocky-ness of fixed width 8x8 fonts.
Might not work for Japanese kana and other langauges,
but English looks fine in 8x8.

&gt;<i> Some already do have 2 outputs a VGA and a DVI out..
</I>
That would be nice.  :)
They are probable above the price range I was looking at.


&gt;&gt;<i> You made good points.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> xorg is nearly to the point where it can be launched without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /etc/X11/xorg.conf and be nearly as usable as it would be with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a more precise configuration file.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps in a year or two it will become better?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would think so... it's definatly evolved
</I>
And devolved also.
I am definitely look forward to seeing the next X release
and if it works better than the current.
On their website at the beginning of the year
it gave a timeline that ended in May this year.
However, now I do no bother to check.
