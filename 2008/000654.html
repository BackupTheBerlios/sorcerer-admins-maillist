<PRE>&gt;<i> Because this write wearing is Sorcery a good choice for usb memory?
</I>
Jan says that it is fine.
It was one of my initial concerns.
Although Sorcerer updates more frequently than other distros
most of the action happens on /usr/src/sorcery and /tmp
which are normally both tmpfs.
However, when linux compiles it compiles in /usr/src
That is the one exception.

Of course /var/cache/sources and /var/tmp receive use.
However, /var/cache/ccache can be turned off
and /var/cache/archive/ can be turned off,
and /var/tmp can have tmpfs mounted upon it.


&gt;<i> but speed might be
</I>&gt;<i> problem as usb disks are not so fast and if you want compile whole sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> that might take some time todo using external usb disks.
</I>
Tests on my USB flash drives suggest that they perform better
for compilation than fixed disks since there is no head seek time.
Most of the files read during compilation are small,
such as header files.
They are entirely read from flash drive faster
than they can be read from fixed disk.


&gt;<i> I am myself waiting for real flash drives, SSD drives, using MLC cells, like
</I>&gt;<i> OCZ Core drives, for my main gaming machine, thinking to put like 2 * 64GB
</I>&gt;<i> using RAID1 (or 0) as C-drive would be pretty fast, queiet and low power
</I>&gt;<i> etc. and put my main storage to my new SAN storage server. I am using iSCSI
</I>&gt;<i> to distribute storage.
</I>
We all dream of that day.  :)


&gt;<i> Anyway i am thinking that might it possible to design some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> pre-compiled binaries system to sorcerer, because i dont see very wise move
</I>&gt;<i> to can install sorcerer to usb memory if you need to compile whole system. I
</I>&gt;<i> know there is this dependencies hell that will make it difficult but anyway
</I>&gt;<i> just make compiled binaries with good choice of options turned on.
</I>
The I/Rs are about as pre-compiled as Sorcerer becomes.
And it is a good start.
It does contain a usable xorg installation with video drivers.

Around the end of 2007 I wanted an I/R with KDE installed.
But that is not likely to happen unless I have an x86_64 box.


&gt;<i> Or what if some kind of remote compiling sorcerer farm that will compile
</I>&gt;<i> your sources with your optional options turned on/off, some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> chrootet, etc system? That would be certainly a very cool system.
</I>
That is easy and less useful than you might expect.
But a number of Sorcerer SAs already share /var/cache/archive/
among boxes and use sorcery features to be able to reuse
archives for updates instead of recompiling.
However, at least one box, which is updated first
and probably the developmental box,
must not re-use archives.

If deploying flash drives for notebooks
one could always build the initial loadout on a fixed disk
and then transfer it to as many flash drives as desired.
However, I still recommend updating those flash drive
installations since they, like any deployed box,
become more vulnerable over time as bugs and exploits
in software become known.

However, if the notebooks are not usually network connected
and the installations on USB flash drives have encrypted root
and those flash drives never leave take a trip away from their owner
then that may be reasonably safe to let age for 6 months and
then completely dispose of.

With current technology and 32G flash drives
I expect that holds enough space and life in order
to deploy a box for 2 years with updates.
Jan expects more than a 10 year lifespan.
Perhaps the more accurate estimate is somewhere in between?
I would still expect a 2 year life span to be sufficient.

Given how sorcery-md5sum can check files
there may be a way to determine when is a good time
to backup, restore to a new flash drive and snap the old one in two?
But of course md5sums on files do not always change
due to corruption.
Or rather they rarely change due to file corruption.

With fixed disk sometimes they turn to Swiss cheese,
sometimes they flake a little in usual locations,
and sometimes they fail entirely.
However, I would expect with flash drive technology
there aught to be a more graceful way to tell when they are failing.
If they support smart drive diagnostics
then that might provide information
to suggest when the flash drive should be replaced?
I should test a flash drive with smartmontools,
but I have not done so yet.
