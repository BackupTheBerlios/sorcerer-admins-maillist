<PRE>Hi

Back from my summer holidays, lots of talking here i see, which is good 
thing.
Anyway on my holidays i installed my homemade SAN-storage network using 
cheap PC parts. I did use 2 USB sticks (4 GB each, 20 Euros each), made 
them RAID0 array and installed Ubuntu (from alternate CD). Anyway, 
installation is pretty much dead easy as usb sticks are looking as normal 
disks at Linux (eg. /dev/sda, etc), i just made small /boot partition to 
first stick and voila, it just works (tm). One downside is that my machine 
does not boot unless i take one usb stick away from machine, then i get 
GRUB loader and i can put another stick back to machine and continue 
booting :-)

Anyway i got now 3 * 1TB disks at RAID5 array atm plus LVM on top of it. 
Made small /var logical volume and mounted it (as /var ofc) so most writes 
are going to my raid5 array not to my usb sticks, as you all know usb 
sticks do not like when you write to them too many times.

Because this write wearing is Sorcery a good choice for usb memory? I can 
see if you use external usb disks, as they are normal hdd drives with just 
usb bridge, might be good choice if you do rescue system, but speed might 
be problem as usb disks are not so fast and if you want compile whole 
sorcerer that might take some time todo using external usb disks. 
I am myself waiting for real flash drives, SSD drives, using MLC cells, 
like OCZ Core drives, for my main gaming machine, thinking to put like 2 * 
64GB using RAID1 (or 0) as C-drive would be pretty fast, queiet and low 
power etc. and put my main storage to my new SAN storage server. I am 
using iSCSI to distribute storage.

Anyway i am thinking that might it possible to design some sort of 
pre-compiled binaries system to sorcerer, because i dont see very wise 
move to can install sorcerer to usb memory if you need to compile whole 
system. I know there is this dependencies hell that will make it difficult 
but anyway just make compiled binaries with good choice of options turned 
on. 

Or what if some kind of remote compiling sorcerer farm that will compile 
your sources with your optional options turned on/off, some kind of 
chrootet, etc system? That would be certainly a very cool system.
