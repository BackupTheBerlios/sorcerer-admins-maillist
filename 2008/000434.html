<PRE>While working on this video server box, I found a place where a faulty
(old, obsolete) switch caused network errors on my card.  While there
was also a fix released in february for this version for my card,
replacing the switch also fixed the problem.

Meanwhile this box runs X, and uses an NVIDIA card.  Had to attempt to
update the driver without network access (not so painful as it was)

NVIDIA-Linux-x86 does not compile and work with 2.6.25.2  there are 2
problems 1) a removed symbol global_flush_tlb() (?) and then it fails
to find the symbol 'set_page_attr'.

there is a beta driver 173.08 which does compile and work with
2.6.25.2 ( has Beta in the nvidia logo )

<A HREF="http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=107144">http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=107144</A>

(there is an FTP site with these drivers)
<A HREF="ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/">ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/</A>

----------------------
Okay, so with 2.6.25.2 and 173.08 (I tried most of the 169.12, 171.xx
) I had a system which seemed to not have problems from network
congestion, and still ran. ..

but it didn't work... what has been working for a few years to launch
and track vlc processes ended up with sockets stuck as open by vlc
which no longer had a pid.  zombie vlc processes, and a few other
zombies as things came and went.

Booted the older kernel, cleaned up now driver conflicts cause the
application level X driver and the kernel were a different version,
and 173.08 didn't want to build in the older linux... (maybe cause I
still had 2.6.25.2 in /usr/src/linux?) got rid of all my customized
spells in /usr/share/sorcery/local, recast linux, recast NVIDIA-linux,
replaced the switch, and now all is well again :)

Beware there may be issues with this kernel.
