Wow!
That was incredibly good thinking.
Thanks for suggesting it.
But even if it does use bzip2's library
pbzip2 itself could contain bugs.

# ldd /usr/bin/pbzip2
        linux-gate.so.1 =&gt;  (0xb8082000)
        libpthread.so.0 =&gt; /lib/libpthread.so.0 (0xb8048000)
        libbz2.so.1.0 =&gt; /lib/libbz2.so.1.0 (0xb8036000)
        libstdc++.so.6 =&gt; /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 (0xb7f53000)
        libm.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libm.so.6 (0xb7f2d000)
        libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt; /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0xb7f22000)
        libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6 (0xb7de6000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb8083000)

According to ldd pbzip2 does appear to use bzip2's library.

# cat /etc/sorcery/log/elf/pbzip2
/usr/bin/pbzip2 /lib/libbz2.so.1.0      bzip2
/usr/bin/pbzip2 /lib/libc.so.6  glibc
/usr/bin/pbzip2 /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so.1  gcc
/usr/bin/pbzip2 /lib/libm.so.6  glibc
/usr/bin/pbzip2 /lib/libpthread.so.0    glibc
/usr/bin/pbzip2 /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 gcc

The ELF log agrees.

# augur elfof pbzip2
bzip2
glibc
gcc

And augur elfof pbzip2 also agrees.

# augur lclof pbzip2
bzip2
glibc

And so does lclof analysis of the compile log.

*chuckles*

I listed all that to show the nifty ways that information
can be acquired about installed files, especially ELFs
by both system tools such as ldd, objdump, and
also the sorcery tools.

Since bzip2 is a compression method with specific sized blocks
doing concurrent compression of different blocks and then
merging them together into a single archive is not difficult.
pbzip2 could be implemented using a bash script and dd.
However, that would not be eloquent.

The question that comes to mind for me is
does pbzip2 achieve better decompression speed?
Afterall most Sorcerer boxes will not roll bzip2 archives,
but instead will decompress them.

If anyone wants to do testing of compression and decompression
speeds using pbzip2 vs bzip2 on a dual core box and report results please
that would give greater support for allowing pbzip2 to replace bzip2.
Also the transition would not be as easy as expected.
For the sake of the libraries which are required by several
other software projects, bzip2 would still have to be installed.

If decompression speed is nearly the same for pbzip2 for average
sized source tarballs then the complexity of making pbzip2
a replacement for bzip2 may be unwarranted.
Keep in mind that a file being compressed with block size of 900K
would have to be at least larger than 900K to begin to gain any
speed improvement from pbzip2.
Likewise for decompression a file must contain multiple compressed
blocks of data in order for different processors to concurrently
decompress them.
However, there are many sources which are large enough.
However, with larger sources pbzip2 often achieves better compression
ratio at a speed comparable to bzip2.
Too bad almost no source tarballs are distributed as .tar.7z
