</I>
Yes, but some of network can start in S an some in 3, 4... etc...

which implies multiple (more than 1 ) run level for setting up and
getting networking going.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I ran into problems with networking starting in runlevel 3 because of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> X.  I start X in runlevel 3 from inittab, which causes it to start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without network (sometimes start) and sometimes just die.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unless using startx after console login
</I>&gt;<i> then X should be started automatically from runlevels 4 and 5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Okay whatever, technicality.... yes standards indicate this is true...
and all I'd have to do is change the default in inttab to 5 from 3...
not an issue.

&gt;&gt;<i> I solved my problem by implementing a script to start x also in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> runlevel 3 and depended it on the network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If networking starts in sysinit
</I>&gt;<i> then it will probably be ready for use by the time
</I>&gt;<i> xdm, gdm, kdm-v3, kdm-v4 or any other GUI login
</I>&gt;<i> starts in runlevels 4 and 5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, XDM does not have an option to auto login. I do not WANT gdm or
kdm - as I do not need all their additional bloat of gnome or kde
libraries.

and yes - option to start networking in S level would have fixed my
issue also (which was what I was originaly going to do)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem with this is that X doesn't happily restart.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above sentence I am still confused about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There is no auto restart when running startx.
when X exits, it exits.

&gt;&gt;<i> xdm has no auto login feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I expect that if one were to adjust the configuration
</I>&gt;<i> files in /etc/X11/xdm/
</I>&gt;<i> that it is possible to configure xdm
</I>&gt;<i> to startup kiosk style.
</I>&gt;<i> I did it at least once back in XFree86 3.something.
</I>&gt;<i> However, using kdm-v3 or kdm-v4
</I>&gt;<i> or gdm would probably be easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There is NO auto login option for xdm.

See above.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - what's the official good way to have a process restart when it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dies?  init takes care of this very wll.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> init can be made to restart services as soon as they die
</I>&gt;<i> by following the instructions in man inittab
</I>&gt;<i> However, if a service is started from an init-script
</I>&gt;<i> then it will not automatically restart if it dies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
that's pretty much my point... I would rather that my startx was
maintained by inittab.

but a really stupid simple script works...

--- watch_task --
#!/bin/bash

$*
echo $(date) restarting $* &gt;&gt;/tmp/watch_task.log
$0 $* &amp;

-------------------
Not really an issue, but it is a custom hack rather than a standard
utility to restart a task.


&gt;<i> However, it is possible to write the init-script
</I>&gt;<i> to invoke a wrapper and have that wrapper
</I>&gt;<i> invoke the desired service and
</I>&gt;<i> have that wrapper automatically restart the service
</I>&gt;<i> when the service dies.
</I>&gt;<i> However, whenever the wrapper program dies
</I>&gt;<i> then the service will probably no long restart.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When init from inittab is instructed to start a service
</I>&gt;<i> and restart the service whenever the service dies
</I>&gt;<i> then init will continue doing so until init dies.
</I>&gt;<i> init never dies, because if it does the kernel will immediately halt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If xserver zapping is permitted I can understand
</I>&gt;<i> how a use could press ctrl-alt-backspace to kill
</I>&gt;<i> the X server and then no Xserver would be running.
</I>&gt;<i> And it is possible that the X server might crash itself.
</I>&gt;<i> Or if the window manager is holding the X server open
</I>&gt;<i> and the window manager program crashes then
</I>&gt;<i> the X server will also close.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> xdm kdm gdm wrap the X server.
</I>&gt;<i> If the X server dies then xdm kdm gdm
</I>&gt;<i> gracefully restart the X server.
</I>&gt;<i> In most configurations this presents a GUI login.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, it is wise to have a kiosk started by
</I>&gt;<i> xdm kdm or gdm in order to automatically restart
</I>&gt;<i> the X server whenever the X server dies.
</I>&gt;<i> A guest user would probably not know what to do
</I>&gt;<i> other than restart the box if ctrl-alt-delete works
</I>&gt;<i> or a reset button or power cord is accessible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
xdm kdm and gdm are not solutions.  They are just adtional problems.
