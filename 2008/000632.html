<PRE>&gt;<i> I fully agree that if indexing is slower using source(), then it should not
</I>&gt;<i> be changed - we want maximum speed ;)
</I>
The expected difference is minimal &lt; 5% at most.
Instead of 30 seconds for full indexing on an old Pentium 3,
perhaps 32 to 34 seconds?

However, for new and updated spells
I recommend that the content of url be moved onto source:

url $SOURCEFORGE_URL
source something/something-VERSION.tar.bz2

should become

source $SOURCEFORGE_URL something/something-$VERSION.tar.bz2

Proper use of &quot;&quot; enclosure often increases indexing speed.
However, I prefer a grimoire with a minimal use of quotes.
Every quote or double quote requires a pair.
Therefore, if quotes rarely occur
then the chance of unpaired quotes will also rarely occur.
A reduction in probability of human error is worth
a 20% reduction in indexing speed.

The sorcery and grimoire with the next release is not maximum speed.
More drastic measures would be used to achieve maximum indexing speed.
A compromise between functionality, readability and speed is more desirable.

Now spells are:
1. more readable especially without all the ' &quot; = ;
2. indexed faster than any prior sorcery release;
3. run by bash for proper index generation;
4. invulnerable to unpredictable variable bleeds resulting index abnormalities.


&gt;<i> But you don't say that you will edit 3000 spells manually for such a change
</I>&gt;<i> ? Why not just write a bash-script (or c++ or whatever language you choose)
</I>&gt;<i> - it will be faster to make and execute than doing the change manually - and
</I>&gt;<i> the time to ensure that there are no errors left will be a lot less.
</I>
That would work for most spells.
But there are always strangely written spells.
Automatic changes can produce unexpected and undesirable effects.
I am very careful when doing any automatic editing of the grimoire.
I do not want to break it horribly and not notice.
Yet I still do that sometimes for a select group of spells.

I am working towards creating a grimoire where
one function invocation has all the parameters on the smae line.
A very uniform grimoire would be easier
to adjust with meager and fast sed commands.

Manual editing takes hours upon hours of mundane work,
but it allow me to discover and correct some very strange spells.

I do sed -i the grimoire for some tasks.
However, I first make certain that quality
does not break for the sake of speed.


When writing and updating spells please remember:

The larger and more complex the spell is
the better and more aligned it should look.
If it looks bad and has many tabs in it
and
something tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab &amp;&amp;
in it
then I will irritate myself when updating/correcting it.
I will be pressing del while fixing the spell and
send half of the next line to /dev/null without expecting it.
Try not to use tabs
Try not to have
                                &amp;&amp;
way out to the right.
No need for a mockery of my style.
Just try to make nice aligned columns so that the eyes can go up an down
easily detecting typos and seeing where the same variable
is used in different commands.

If you write spells with syntax like:

require${TAB}${TAB}something${TAB}something_else

where you use tabs instead of spaces
then I will be unable to detect and fix those spells using sed commands
if I make macro changes to the grimoire.

That is one of the many reasons why I request that tabs
are not used in spells.
They cause me to make mistakes when hand editing spells.
They cause me to make mistakes when seditng spells.
They cause me to make mistakes!
Therefore, put tabs in spells only when the reason is unavoidable.

Do not write spells with

function build()

I will never properly detect it with grep or sed.
I grep for:

^build()

Just write your spells like the 2000+ other spells written the same way.

The more unique that you make your spells
that enter the official grimoire
then the less likely I will be able to make changes
by writing programs and/or sed commands.

I am not asking for absolute compliance to a strict specification.
Just tend to make spells like majority of the spells that already exist.
I wrote most of them.
View any 10 at random and you will realize the pattern to my madness.  :)

Comments at the top.
function calls to assign variables under the comments.
The left column is right aligned.
The right column is left aligned.
There is even a general order that I use to invoke functions to assign
variables.

  stable
unstable
  secure

Those above 3 functions almost always occur near the top.


The current standard spell formula is not perfect nor perfectly pretty.
But it is becoming better.
For most spells it has almost the terse simplicity of a flat file.
But the alignment is a clear indication that spells are written
for humans to be able to easily read, check and modify them.

If you keep in mind that at least 10 other people
will look at a spell after you write it
then you will not omit the extra minute
required to make the spell look as good as it runs.


P.S.

Now that function calls are used to set variables
mistyped function names will result in an error message.
Previously, mistyped variables created no error message,
because BASH does not warning about the use of undeclared variables.
Therefore, this new format provides a better checking for spells.
