<PRE>Hi there.

So, you use Core2 too? Good! Do you still use cpref in Sorcery? What I
mean to ask, do you pass -march=core2 to gcc when compiling your
spells?

Thanks for the info. I did a clean install on a laptop of a very
recent Sorcerer I/R.

I was able to cast swig without a problem. It was only after I added
my cpref file and sources that I moved the laptop over to a monolithic
kernel.
( I get massive speed gains when running code tuned especially for the Core2 )
Then I started a sorcery rebuild. About halfway through the process,
swig, gstreamer and gst-plugins-base stopped compiling.
To be honest, they do not even make it through the ./configure script,
failing on what looks like bash not properly recognising pairs of
backticks.
I had the same problem with ncurses, and actually hacked the sources,
replacing the ticks with $() to make it work, as a box without ncurses
is not a linux box.

Kyle and me have been looking at all sorts of bits of the computer,
and we still cannot figure out exactly what is happening.

I first thought it could be my locale settings, but on the laptop
install my locale and LANG setting was en_US only, and still this
error crept in.

It looks like it only rears it head when I do a rebuild, which would
point to some source compiling differently now than what it had done
before. I guess.

My CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS compiler flags are now most conservative, at
-march=core2 -O1 -pipe, and LDFLAGS are -Wl, -O1.

Basically, I was able to do a full rebuild on the 28 Jun, 2 Jul. Then
I travelled around the world a little, and built a quad Core2 for my
home use.
on the 29 Jul I was having this problem with bash not doing the
expected thing, it might be thinking it is getting invoked as /bin/sh,
which has less functionality.

Most recently I was beginning to think that there might be a backtick
floating around in Sorcerer, but even calling ./configure from the
command line still produces the same error on swig and gstreamer. So,
Sorcerery is innocent. :)

When the same error occured on a clean install of Sorcerer I was
baffled, but sure that it is not my weird setup...
