<PRE>Thanks for the info.
However, those messages about:

cannot find include file &quot;stddef.h&quot;

are common in MesaLib.
They do not break compilation.

I have already compiled MesaLib
Compile log for MesaLib 7.0.1c
Built with sorcery implosion-20080206-0 and gcc 4.2.3
Built on Wed Feb  6 13:54:13 MST 2008
...
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/sorcery/MesaLib/Mesa-7.0.1/progs'
`progs/xdemos/glxgears' -&gt; `/usr/bin/glxgears'
`progs/xdemos/glxinfo' -&gt; `/usr/bin/glxinfo'
`/root/.sorcery/grimoire/MesaLib.d/drirc' -&gt; `/etc/drirc'

If MesaLib fails compilation
then you may want to include the lines from
the compile log towards the end
that sometimes show a useful error message.
Or you can send the gziped compile log
directly to me as an attachment.

Probably the most recent change to MesaLib was:

 # According to Evert Vorster
 # MesaLib should be compiled with -fno-strict-aliasing added to CFLAGS
 # in order for OpenGL to work with xf86-video-intel drivers
 CFLAGS+=' -fno-strict-aliasing'

Did adding that to CFLAGS
cause a compile error?
Is the error happening on ia32
or x86_64 architecture, please?


&gt;<i> why are the gcc's include path not in the seeked path of MesaLib spell?
</I>
MesaLib may have a bit of legacy code in it
that was inherited from XFree86.
For example it requires makedepend to compile.
Almost nothing from xorg still uses makedepend.
And that appears to be somehow related to
the messages about stdef.h

makedepend: warning:  glcontextmodes.c (reading
/usr/X11R6/include/sys/types.h, line 147): cannot find include file
&quot;stddef.h&quot;

However, as long as warnings are not being
regarded as errors this should not create a problem.
stddef.h is a header file from gcc.
gcc always knows where to find it's own headers.
They can be included using include lines in sources
and other headers without requiring an appropriate
hyphen capital I to indicate what directory that are in.
Even if that is given to MesaLib those warning
messages might still occur since they are comming
from makedepend and no gcc.
Because as I mentioned above gcc and g++
always knows where to find it's own header files.
That is why there are no significant gcc caused
problems by installing gcc in /opt

On the other hand libtool causes all sorts of problems.
That is why the current version of gcc is now
installed in /usr while older versions are installed in /opt
First, that avoids some libtool problems.
But libtool may create additional problems when
compiling a source that uses libtool with a different
version of gcc than was used to compile the libraries
that the currently compiling source requires.
Given that libtool can still cause problems.
Second, new Sorcerer SAs sometimes start asking
me why gcc is installed in /opt/gcc/ and so forth...
Novice SAs are a bit confused by it.
Third, I since modern releases of gcc support
the -march=native I feel inspired to add support
to cast for correctly selecting optimizations
in the event that an expected cpref file is not
discovered in /etc/sorcery/cpref/

This you may find amusing.
Nearly all sources will compile with something like
-march=native -O
-Wl,-s

That yields a moderately fast compile time
while stripping ELF libraries and executables.

However, for some spells I have specified
CFLAGS and/or LDFLAGS in the spell definition.
MesaLib, for example,
now has:

    CFLAGS='-O3'
   LDFLAGS='-Wl,-O1'

That would be the most recent change to MesaLib
which might cause a compile error.
However, it probably does not effect your
compilation because
If a cpref file exists then the cpref file is used
instead of the in spell recommendations.
And the automatic optimization would naturally
add the appropriate -march to the CFLAGS
and CXXFLAGS

Moving along to the point of the change is
that by not using cpref files a box can compile
with the higher level of optimization in sources
that are expected to benefit from it.
Sources that install libraries or executables
capable of running the CPU at full bore for
seconds or minutes at a time receive higher
levels of optimization:
gzip, bzip2, p7zip, bash, MesaLib, sed, coreutils,
etc....

Normally, a SA might set aggressive or fast
for cpref for those spells, but now without
a default cpref file the SA can go along with
the recommended CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and
LDFLAGS that are specified in the spell.
Naturally, very few spells have CFLAGS,
CXXFLAGS, or LDFLAGS specified.

Therefore, this change amounts to
decreased SA effort,
improved performance,
and reduced compile time.
And SAs that want to continue using cpref
files may continue to use cpref files.
The functionality we now enjoy is not going away.

Also changed is ccache behavior.
gcc* attribute kde3 spells no longer
compile with ccache when ccache is installed.
Also spells with estimates less than 500
will compile without ccache.
There are numerous reasons for this change.
However, I will skip the explanation.
This change like the cpref change should
overall reduce compilation time
and conserve disk space
and reduce amount of CPU spent re-compressing
ccache archive files in /var/cache/ccache/

The trend of these changes is to make sorcery
more innately do what SAs want by providing
a good compromise between stability
performance and compilation time
with less effort from from the SA.

Also in newer versions of sorcery is a slightly
modified appearance for # augur scry
It provides less information.
But the appearance is more uniform.
This makes reading the state of progress
faster to accomplish in a single glance.

Because gcc is migrating from /opt/gcc/current
to /usr this will cause many ELF failures.
These are actually pseudo failures.
Installed ELFs that link with libstdc++
will still continue to work just fine.
However, cast will consider the errors real.
And it will recast almost every spell
that installs ELFs that are linked with libstdc++
As long as future versions of
gcc are installed into /usr
then this forced recompilation will be the last.

I debated about whether to sedit the sorcery
logs in /etc/sorcery/log/ldd/ to prevent the
massive amount of ELF failures.
You can elect to do so if you want.
However, I decided that for those who may
have been holding installed spells for a long time
that this may be a good opportunity to shake
the dust off the fixed disks.
This is about as close as Sorcerer boxes ever
come to having to be re-installed from a newer
Install/Rescue release.

In addition to the improvements in sorcery tools
some previous functionality has been moved
into spells:

sorcery-bgz  for background compression daemon
sorcery-alien for monthly check for alien files
sorcery-defrag for monthly file de-fragmentation
sorcery-md5sum for weekly md5sum checks

Having these as spells provides
a good convenience for SAs.

For example to view the alien list
I merely type:
# augur compile sorcery-alien
The compile log from the last time it ran
shows what aliens were discovered.

The monthly de-fragmentation provides a
good way to keep performance up and drive
wear and tear down.
Tested on ext3 each cast eliminated
fragmentation from 1/3 of the installed
fragmented files.

As for the weekly md5sum check.
It locates unexpected modified and/or corrupt files,
enters into the cast queue
those spells owning those files
and since cast is already running
cast recompiles those spells.
For the SA that regularly does md5sum checks
hanging the md5sum check on a weekly spell
gains a &quot;fire and forget&quot; solution for maintaining
file integrity.

All of these improvements come with a slight
chance of instability and bugs.
Please make bug reports as you encounter the bugs.
For the cost of some cooperation
we can achieve better performance,
improved functionality while decreasing
the overall workload upon the SA.
If Sorcerer was a wheel
then one might say we are truing it up for 2008.
Once the transition is complete
prepare for a smooth fast ride.
