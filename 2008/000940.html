<PRE>&gt;<i> At this point i think transfer routine is broken.
</I>&gt;<i> For a next version of I/R ISO installer could you make a verify option
</I>&gt;<i> available to check if transfer was ok or not. I think older versions did
</I>&gt;<i> have verify but its gone from current versions?
</I>
According to your next email it broke in a way that I did not expect.


&gt;<i> Also using compile menu and its chroot casting goes show so quickly errors
</I>&gt;<i> so you dont have time to read what error message chroot is saying so also
</I>&gt;<i> could you make some error checking if chroot was ok or not also and perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> capture errors from chroot itself. It would help debugging where errors
</I>&gt;<i> might lie.
</I>
Compile errors are not supposed to happen during installation.


&gt;<i> Just make a chroot_cast shell script so if you are using shell to make some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of manual install there is easy way to chroot_cast init-scripts,
</I>&gt;<i> functions, etc...
</I>
I doubt SAs would find it if I created it.


&gt;<i> BTW offtopic question: are we moving some day to use GRUB instead of LILO? I
</I>&gt;<i> like GRUB more because it's boot loader has more flexibility than lilo has.
</I>
I like lilo.
If someone who understands grub writes those code to properly
integrate support for grub with the init-scripts, initramfs regeneration,
proper grub re-installation, support for image passwords,
support for device names or at least detection by UUID, etc
then we can have grub.
However each year that I check grub to see if it will do what I want
I am disappointed that it does not.
And unlike lilo grub must be installed into the MBR.
Those who dual boot a box with another operating system might
prefer that some other boot loader or MBR be installed in the MBR?


&gt;<i> Except for encrypted root, other major distro's wizard like installers do
</I>&gt;<i> support LVM2 and software raid (in a expert mode), they are actually basic
</I>&gt;<i> stuff nowdays, not some advanced senior level stuff ;)
</I>
I have read about that also.
However, the complexity of LVM2 is not standard
even if some distros only support it.
Boxes can still be deployed perfectly without LVM2.
Even worse is that some of the distros that support mdadm and LVM2
do so in a less optimal order than Sorcerer.
It probably should be bottom to top md LUKS LVM2 as it is in Sorcerer.


&gt;<i> Some distro's like Red Hat Enterprise distro and it's clones like CentOS are
</I>&gt;<i> using LVM2 as default, so normal installer is actually doing LV root, etc.
</I>
That make sense.
Redhat drives the development of LVM2
If not for LVM2 we might be using evms by IBM.
However, evms does not exactly work properly at the moment.
Frankly, LVM2 is a more complex twist that uses the device mapper.
A distro could do just fine using mdadm, LUKS and the device mapper.
Initially I almost decided not to support LVM2


&gt;<i> My point was that there are lot's of SSH scanners, i mean lots of them, who
</I>&gt;<i> does scan port 22 and tries to login with some accounts and passwords,
</I>&gt;<i> thousands and thoudands times in a day.
</I>
I suppose not having the port answer saves a little bandwidth.
But still finding a ssh2 port is far from impossible.
Also keeping it within the first 1024 ports is wise just to prevent
a local nefarious user from getting the chance to somehow backdoor it.
If any IP address is unreasonably opening connects to port 22
a iptables rule can fix that.
logging may be useful also to detect attack vectors.
Lastly, one can always make a single designated method for
entering a network that is not on port 22
while still using port 22 as the default from inside the network
especially if those boxes do not have globally route-able IP addresses
or the firewall/router protects them.

&gt;<i> So currently it helps to put ssh to different port than 22. And because they
</I>&gt;<i> are using username + password so disabling normal password authentication
</I>&gt;<i> scanners do not have any change to break in if someone is using bad
</I>&gt;<i> password.
</I>
If someone really wants to crack their way into a network
they would try each port in a semi random fashion over a log stretch
of time until the proper ssh2 port can be identified.
Having ssh2 on another port seems like a great deal of effort
for a benefit that is almost too easily defeated.
Do you use custom init scripts or custom /etc/services  ?
Wait I do not need to know.
Forget the question.
It just seems like a lot of effort.


&gt;<i> Yes, there are some cases where you take password out of private key, like
</I>&gt;<i> if you use SSH connections in crontab etc.
</I>&gt;<i> But anyway i dont see any major problem if using SSH keys instead of normal
</I>&gt;<i> passwords, i dont see that any major security risk.
</I>
I did not expect that a key could have the password removed
after it was initially created.
