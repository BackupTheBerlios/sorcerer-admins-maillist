<PRE>Soon you may notice that an update involving sorcery
gives optionals for sorcery-immune and sorcery-bootblaze spells.

Over time the functionality added to sorcery that
does not belong in sorcery will be added as grimoire spells.

Many such spells already exist:

glibc-locales
glibc-localetime
init-scripts
init-functions
sorcery-immune
sorcery-bootblaze

In this fashion of adding additional spells the functionality of
the administration of Sorcerer boxes is improved without
increasing the complexity of sorcery.
Furthermore, requests for new functionality to be added to sorcery
that I would normally reject may now be implemented as separate spells.

Probably due to the inefficient or simplistic way that
sorcery's immune system did filesystem space monitoring
I know one or more SAs are using separate programs to do that.
Monitoring filesystems for free disk space is a good example
of functionality that should never have been added to sorcery.
However, having something that does free space monitoring is a good idea.
But it should have been implemented as a separate spell.

Consequently, the sorcery-immune spell now provides
toggles for the 3 major types of immunity.
The md5sum check, the neglect check, and the stall check.

If someone wants a bash script to monitor disk space and report consumption
then I recommend that that they write the script and have it added as a spell.
It would be a good exercise in learning how to extend Sorcerer functionality
through the use of spells.

Adding functionality through spells has several nice benefits.

1. No approval to modify sorcery is required since sorcery is not modified.
2. Sorcery remains simple and therefore easier to maintain and less
likely to break.
3. Useful functionality that does not belong in sorcery can be made as a spell.

Most SAs know that I prevent sorcery from growing in complexity.
Sorcery shall not become like a malignant tumor.
However, neither do I want to hamper the creativity of generous SAs
who have useful ideas to implement and share.
Therefore, creating spells to enhance Sorcerer functionality is best for
the development of Sorcerer because it encourages SAs to contribute
ideas in the form of spells while keeping sorcery small and simple enough
that beneficial changes can be made with a minimal risk of causing any breaks.

Now onto discussion about KDE.
Not everyone is happy with KDE 4.0.0
nor the implementation of the kde*-v3 spells.
Consequently, work continues on that.
The goal is to have a complete KDE 4 in /opt/kde4
and a complete KDE 3 in /opt/kde3.
With this change each SA should be able to have
the KDE version that they desire.
The changes will probably not be complete until the last week of January.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Until then, try best to manage with crash happy KDE 4.0
