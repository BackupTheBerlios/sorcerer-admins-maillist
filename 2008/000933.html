What might that be?
# augur scry

Using screen with sorcery is completely optional now.
Most of cast operates as a background daemon,
and the same for leech.
Only dispel runs entirely in the foreground.

However, the logs of scroll that are generated when cast
and leech are running can be viewed with the command
# augur scry $SPELL

And for an overview of what is happening simply issue:
# augur scry

I am uncertain about what is missing.

</I>
Well 1G may be a bit much, but it can be useful and it allows room for growth.
And spare space could be allocated for a swap if needed.
Currently,
$ du -sm /boot/*
43      /boot/2.6.26
46      /boot/2.6.26.5
54      /boot/2.6.27.7

As it demonstrate the amount of space required for booting a kernel
is steadily increasing.
If each image required 100M then 1G would allow up to 10 images.
However, for legacy reasons Sorcerer only maintains up to 4,
for the time being.

Every convenience has a cost, of course.
And gaining the maximum benefit for a modular kernel
has a large cost in disk space that I had not fully anticipated
since Sorcerer used monolithic kernels for so many years.

Also if a kernel and modules were made that contained debug information
then they would require a magnitude more space.
A 500M kernel + initramfs is possible.
Although I will try to keep that from happening.

With those uncertainties a 1G /boot seems like a fair estimate.
However, not all boxes will require it.
Yet to run a box where the / is encrypted or has a RAID that
is not merely a shadow then a /boot partition is necessary.
Also it might be required when using LVM2 in some cases.

Also with modern Sorcerer a much smaller /boot/fast
can be generated automatically when appropriate.
The initramfs for the fast boot image is precisely cut.
Therefore, it is smaller, loads faster, uses less RAM,
and less disk space.
It is another method which increases Sorcerer boot speed.

And for SAs that want it
kexec-tools
when installed allows for a software only reboot
that loads the new initramfs and kernel into RAM
and then executes it without a BIOS reboot and
without running lilo.

kexec rebooting is nice when it works,
but may not work all the time
due to bugs related to kexec.
Therefore, I do not recommend it for production boxes.
However, it will come pre-installed with the new I/Rs
because it allows for a fancy new menu during boot
that makes the I/R more helpful for rescuing a box.

Even if a thing here and there may be tossed aside,
overall quality and functionality is still on the rise.
The benefit of booting using an initramfs comes with
almost no added complexity to SAs since the regeneration
of the initramfs and running of lilo is automatically handled
by init scripts during shutdown.
