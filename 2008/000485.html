<PRE>Although I did not understand everything that came
before the last question
the answer to:
&quot;When prompted for 'select individual locales' it's okay that I said
'no' right ?&quot;

is yes that is okay.

If you do not select individual locales to build
then a very large set of locales are built that
cover nearly anything anyone could want,
and it probably consumes about 300M

I have only a few locales built.

# locale -a
C
en_US
en_US.iso88591
en_US.utf8
ja_JP.eucjp
ja_JP.utf8
POSIX


My default locale is

# echo $LANG
en_US.UTF-8

Seems to work okay for me.

I do not have a spell for xfte.
My workstation does not have mono installed.
And the first program that comes to mind that
uses SDL accepts keyboard input is mplayer.
Ah, come to think of it I never use the mplayer GUI.

Does typing work in an xterminal or konsole
or any terminal emulator?

Some programs may not be working properly because
they are compiled with unsafe optimizations that the SA selected.
If the conjecture is that the problem is with the X11R7
components that came with the I/R
then it is easy enough to rebuild all of them.

# cast $( augur installed X11R7 )

The augur command will guess that you want
all installed spells with attribute X11R7 since there
is not X11R7 spell.

Also you may not be using xim as you expect.
If scim is installed then you may be using scim.
I use scim with anthy and scim-bridge-*
This allows me to easily type Japanese kana.
However, if it is causing the problem
then you can dispel anything installed that
is scim

#  augur installed | grep scim
scim
scim-anthy
scim-bridge-gtk+
scim-bridge-qt3
scim-bridge-qt4
scim-ccinput
scim-input-pa

or

# dispel --unsafe $( augur installed | grep scim )

As for xim I know nothing useful about it.
I hope scim is causing the problem.
However, you could try some other xim replacement
such as scim, but one that works better for what
you want to input.
