<PRE>Although I mentioned that I was considering the possibility
I did not mention that I eventually implemented more modular
methods for cast and leech.
And I leaked out a sorcery with modular cast before I made this announcement.

Compile methods are now in /usr/libexec/sorcery/cast.d/
and additional methods by SAs can be installed in
/usr/local/libexec/sorcery/cast.d/

Look at any 2 of the compile methods and the format will be understood.

Similarly, for leech:

/usr{,/local}/libexec/sorcery/leech.d/

However, unlike compile methods leech methods can be set
to run in a specific order from a sorcery menu.

sorcery -&gt; Config -&gt; Extended Features -&gt; Leech Menu

If the installed sorcery does not have the Leech Menu
then it will gain it the next time sorcery is updated.


Cast methods are simple.
They examine the source tree.
If it looks a certain way
then it tries using that method for compilation.
It can currently recognize:

cmake  configure  make  perl-module  profile python-module

And probably more methods in the future.


leech methods are methods for acquiring sources.
Leech methods do not execute merely because they exist in
/usr/libexec/sorcery/leech.d/
Also leech methods do not determine for themselves when to execute.
sorcery has sane default leech method order list.
However, feel free to change it.

Now for the evaluation.

Banes:

1. Took time to hack
2. May encounter bugs leeching
3. Some sources which compiled previously with configure
failed to compile when attempting compilation with cmake,
because software authors porting their code to cmake
introduced bugs or left the implementation incomplete.

Boons:

1. SAs can introduce their own compile and download methods in
/usr/local/sorcery/{cast,leech}.d/ , respectively.
2. Bugged methods will not cause cast or leech to crash.
3. No modifications to cast nor leech are required to add new methods.

The gains for the effort are marginal if any.
However, it may yet bear good fruit in the long run.
Overall it is a good decision because it grants SAs
more direct control over sorcery while minimizing the risk of breaking the tool.
And these changes do not increase the complexity of the sorcery tools.

Please report bugs that you want squished.
