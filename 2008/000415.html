<PRE>Jean-Luc Malet suggested the usefulness of having sorcery's dispel menu
also offer spells to be dispelled that are only optionally required by
other installed spells.
At first I gave the usual response, &quot;I can't do that, Dave.&quot;
But after a some hacking here and there it works.

Be careful when using the dispel menu in the next sorcery release.
It will have an Opt column and spells that are optionally held down will
be at the bottom of the list.
However, it does present them as possibilities for removal.

When the queue is executed from sorcery's queue menu
it will now also forget spells that are queued for dispel.
When sorcery forgets a spell it merely forgets where that spell was
selected as optionally on or optionally off by other spells.
Installed spells that once optionally required that spell
may present another chance to select it as on during an update.

Therefore, optionally required spells can be selected for dispel using
the dispel menu
and they will not automatically re-install later, unless you agree to
it or a spell is installed
that has a mandatory requirement on it.

However, removing optionally required spells may create an ELF failure.
An ELF Failure happens when an installed ELF ( executable or library )
dynamically links with an ELF library that is no longer installed.
Eventually, cast will detect this and cause the installed spells
experiencing ELF failures to recompile and relink.
That will fix the ELF failure.
Therefore, removing spells that are still optionally required will
not usually cause a serious problem on a box,
but it may cause recompilation of other installed spells.
