<PRE>Try:

# rm -rf /var/tmp/{failed,leech}/*
# rm -rf /etc/sorcery/log/fail/*
# augur sync
# augur newer
# augur update


The only unusual hang I have spotted thus far was a hang
on dispel udev on x86_64.
A cp statement ran for 8 hours.
I killed it and udev continued casting fine.
I suspect the problem may have been due to improperly copying
a device node listed in the udev install log?

However, that potential problem will be fixed in the next sorcery release.

Since iiimf is merely an optional requirement

# cast -r -c xterm

and remove the optional for iiimf
unless you really want to do unicode input?
I have no idea how that works.
I use scim to input UTF-8
&#31169;&#12399;&#12288;scim&#12288;&#12362;&#12288;&#20351;&#12356;&#12414;&#12377;

The line above I wrote in Japanese that: &quot;I use scim.&quot;
However, due to Japanese grammar I actually wrote &quot;I scim use.&quot;
It will display properly if spell &quot;kochi-substitute&quot; is installed.


Power failures do not normally wreck Sorcerer boxes.
I would know.
Happens to my boxes.
2 of my UPS are beyond their battery life.

The sorcery tools execute sync after important events.
Therefore, if the filesystem has a properly high commit value
an unexpected power outage has a very low probability of
creating a situation where a spell is not installed that
should be installed or is partially installed and not tracked.

Sorcerer updates software faster than fast food places hire employees.
100 update per month would be low.
300 is not unreasonably for a deployed box.

If you prefer less updates then you can place the more frequently
updating spells on secure progress.
Then they will update only when the
new version is announced as a security fix.
However, a box can not be run with secure progress on all installed spells
indefinitely since library age in contrast to the software that updates will
eventually become too great.
When that happens compile failures will happen that are not normally expected.
A good example of that are boxes not surviving the coreutils update,
because either the installed linux kernel was too old or because the SA
never rebooted to the newer installed linux kernel.

I merely make updates available.
Selecting stable, secure, unstable progress and when to update boxes
and what software to update are decisions for SAs to make.
However with that in mind,
boxes that update every 2 weeks have fewer
update problems than boxes that update every 2 months.
