<PRE>The tmpfs /dev on the initramfs is not deleted.
It is moved from the initramfs to /media/root/dev before
the permanent chroot into /media/root
Since it is a move, if udevd happens to have /dev as it's
current working directly then it will still be in the proper /dev
after it was moved to /media/root/dev and even after the chroot.
However, to be absolutely certain that udev continues working properly
during the runlevel 1 2 3 4 5 udevd is restarted
That ensures that udevd is also started on the root of the real
root filessytem and will use the tmpfs /dev and not use an empty and/or
non existent /dev on the initramfs

The messages about the rmdir thing may be something that crept in
with newer udev because it is not something I remember as always being.

Vincent Penquerc'h is correct.
Eventually whatever is left on the tmpfs filesystem is removed.
I used to have that delay set to 600 seconds after the chroot to the
real root filesystem.
However, now it is at a mere 60 seconds.
It might still be possible for it to be faster without any adverse effect.
Basically, after chrooting to /media/root there is no way back to the
initramfs /.  Since /init is forked into the background before
that chroot it remains able to clean the initramfs of files and directories
before finally exiting.  I would not expect udev would do the same,
especially since it would cause a problem for using the I/R in installation
mode where the boot initramfs remains /

Whether the purging of the initramfs from memory is related to the udev
message I am uncertain.
When sysinit finishes running it is completely complete.
All programs to be started during sysinit are started.
And the real root filesystem is mounted as /
Then, in the first stage of runlevels usually the S00 level
udevd is restarted.
That happens before other programs are started.
It looks as if that is a good time to restart udevd so that
the new udevd will not miss any events during that tiny interval.

That covers the topics of udevd startup and restart during boot
and also the final disposition of the initramfs during boot.
It is a little bit tricky to understand at first,
but overall is a very easy and straight forward approach
by using sysinit from the initramfs and runlevels from the real root filesystem.
That way there is practically no additional complexity added in order
to boot using the initramfs, except the code in /init
/init is not long nor a difficult script.
The most complicated task it can do is
to create a precise initramfs for fast booting.
That finishes the summary of information
that I know which may be relevant to booting
and the udev message during boot about rmdir.

If udev someday gains a rule that causes it to wipe
the real root filesystem then that will be most upsetting.
Removing the content of the initramfs is best left to /init
Vincent Penquerc'h, do any of the udev rules appear to be
designed for removing the initramfs or most of the contents
of any filesystem?
A grep for rm in /lib/udev/rules.d/ shows nothing suspicious.
