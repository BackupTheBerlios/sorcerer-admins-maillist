Perhaps the I/Rs did not successfully transfer?
Maybe the CDs contained errors?
/media/root/bin/bash should have existed.

Okay, maybe you did what Evert was anticipating.
Perhaps, you transferred files and then continued
down the disk menu and selected to unmount partitions.
If the partitions are unmounted then the compile menu
is either not available on the main menu
or it can not be entered.

It is just a really tiny mistake that anyone could make.
I am glad that you reported it because it reinforces
Evert's idea of a single menu as being a good idea.
I want to give it a try and run with it for at least a
few releases of the I/R to see what SAs say about it.

A wizard is not out of the question.
However, it might implemented as a separate installation script.
That way SAs have their choice between cake or pie.
But best to finish the cake before making the pie.

The newer I/R will have a nearly large single main menu design
that should help SAs avoid the potential pitfall of unmounting
the filesystems before compiling required software.

&gt;<i> Perhaps more wizard like could be better? Like all others distros does
</I>&gt;<i> installer, they are wizard like. That might be better approach than manually
</I>&gt;<i> selecting menus, etc. thats confusing.
</I>
Senior level SAs, and especially me, tend not to like to be cornered.
A wizard is not comfortable.
Several years ago the design was tried.
And for issues of it being basically impossible
to go back any step and make corrections it was abandoned.


&gt;<i> Well just wait when i get my new server online so we can virtualize
</I>&gt;<i> devboxes, allthough testing I/R might be difficult to handle unless i make
</I>&gt;<i> you an access to main linux where virtual servers are runned/created. Think
</I>&gt;<i> i will use KVM, instead Xen.
</I>
Testing need not require full virtualization.
I can simply test it using qemu running as my normal user.
Currently, I use qemu and tightvnc to test new I/Rs.

If possible I prefer not to have any access on that box higher
than regular user otherwise encounter any problem will seriously
tempt me to fix it myself.
Also if the account is compromised through an exploit
then not having it lead to a great problem is a good idea.
Sure I know of sudo, but still I would rather not.
A box really requires a dedicated SA
that knows it better than the back of their own hand.


&gt;<i> I managed to get HDD drivers yesterday, 3 * 750GB SATA 2 drivers, just
</I>&gt;<i> testing them on software raid, RAID5, sequential read speed about 250MB/sec
</I>&gt;<i> (thats bytes not bits) at beginning part and end part gives about 100MB/sec.
</I>&gt;<i> Will test also RAID10... But with RAID5 i will get 1.5TB space...
</I>
Wow that is fast.
The demands of the Sorcerer hosting will be slight.
The PPR has always placed the greatest demand on a box,
because it requires the CPU to run sdelta and p7zip.
Getting the PPR fixed would be nice so that software
update patches are available again.
I suspect something has been amiss with it for a while.
Part of the problem was in sorcery.
But although that appears fixed the PPR web server
appears to be displaying php files as plain text
instead of executing them.
If not for that it might work, maybe?
