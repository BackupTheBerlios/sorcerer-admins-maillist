I did not attempt to write this as HTML.
Just tried to type it fast and clean.
I may not be good at docs.
But I am the one who can answer the most questions about Sorcerer's init.
Therefore, I was probably a good choice for writing at least the draft
of this document that helps demystify Sorcerer's boot and shutdown.

SAs who have read what I wrote previously on the list already have a
good idea of how it works.
Those who were on and off on vacation understand bits and pieces.
However, this document helps provide a full and clear picture.
Yet it is not overly detailed.
Therefore, it should aid with clearing confusion rather than creating more.
Of course I might be entirely wrong about that?
But I gave it a good try.
Truly, the choice of content is as dry as can be
and my style of writing makes contact lenses feel like 80 grit sand paper.
However, I would appreciate feedback and corrections.
And I will eventually spell check it when I am not half asleap.

Of course Sorcerer still needs more documentation.
Docs that are useful, witty, and fun to read would be helpful.
Who is excited about documentation?
Now is the time to show what you know.

Docs do not have to be entirely correct or entirely complete.
Is anyone entirely correct or entirely complete?
Exactly!

First, Sorcerer Documentation and next the Human Genome.
Okay, that would be nice, but sufficiently fast computers with
sufficient RAM may not demystify the human genome within our lifetime.
However, Sorcerer Documentation is well within our grasp.
Who is feeling excited enough to write some docs?
