It probably had a sulogin open on a console waiting
for a specified duration for someone to enter the root password
to fix the problem.
If a box appears to hang during shutdown,
please investigate if it is requesting root login to fix a problem.
Shutdown problems should not normally occur.


&gt;<i> at no time did lilo error :(
</I>
Perhaps.

sulogin occurs in:

/etc/init.d/fsck
/etc/init.d/fstab
/etc/init.d/initramfs
/etc/init.d/lilo.conf


/etc/int.d/{initramfs,lilo.conf}
both run during shutdown.
That is probably when it happened.

In both init-scripts sulogin is executed if the invocation of lilo exits
with a non 0 return status.

</I>
root= is not required for initramfs booting.
The root which is mounted during boot is rootfs
which is a ramfs which is then populated from the initrfs images.

With a traditional Sorcerer box that boots without initramfs
and mounts the real root filesystem during booting
root= could be used, but probably is not.
root= is passed kernel command line parameter,
but it has no effect unless processed.

A modern Sorcerer box has /init which executes
on the initramfs as process 1 and does extract
boot= from the kernel command line parameters
and modifies /etc/fstab on the initramfs to use
the root specified on the kernel command line.
However, doing this is not recommended.

Specifying root= as a kernel parameter
or specifying it in the lilo.conf file is not recommended.
The only use for root= is if you really want to mount a different
root or if /etc/fstab lacks an entry for the root filesystem.

The image I use to update the x86_64 I/R does not have / specified in /etc/fstab
However, I select the / to use from a menu that appears during sysinit.
But if I wanted I could specify root= as a kernel command line parameter
or add it to /etc/fstab

Having boot= in /etc/lilo.conf on a modern Sorcerer box may not
cause a problem if the line is indeed correct.
However,  I do not recommend it.
