</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although networking and NFS client support

</I>&gt;<i> The NFS server and sshd do not start until the runlevel
</I>&gt;<i> after all the filesystems are mounted.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, the change is not overkill.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For a long time I have felt apprehensive about starting anything
</I>&gt;<i> that is less than absolutely essential from within sysinit.
</I>&gt;<i> sysinit executes linearly and if a problem occurs then
</I>&gt;<i> then that problem also occurs before console login prompts

</I>&gt;<i> rdinit=/bin/bash
</I>&gt;<i> and then editing or removal of the bugged script in /etc/init.d/
</I>&gt;<i> before exec /init
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I now feel as if the move of networking and NFS

</I>&gt;<i> However, be advised of the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any NFS mounted during boot can seriously stall a box
</I>&gt;<i> during sysinit if the filesystem can not be mounted.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, noauto is recommended if the filesystem
</I>&gt;<i> does not have to be mounted during boot and is NFS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having ppp start from boot may incur a wait state
</I>&gt;<i> if the template is designed to wait until the
</I>&gt;<i> PPP connection is established.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, when starting PPP at boot, fire and forget, is suggested.
</I>&gt;<i> However, that may prevent certain services that require networking
</I>&gt;<i> from being able to bind to the virtual PPP network device.
</I>&gt;<i> sshd and samba can not bind to the PPP
</I>&gt;<i> before the PPP device exists.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, there are yet still potential problems that can happen
</I>&gt;<i> from starting PPP networking during sysinit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When using PPP I recommend that the SA or user

Uhmm... Sounds like networking should have individual levels ....

I ran into problems with networking starting in runlevel 3 because of
X.  I start X in runlevel 3 from inittab, which causes it to start
without network (sometimes start) and sometimes just die.

I solved my problem by implementing a script to start x also in
runlevel 3 and depended it on the network.

The problem with this is that X doesn't happily restart.
xdm has no auto login feature.


  - what's the official good way to have a process restart when it
dies?  init takes care of this very wll.

and a side question
  - what is the environment of an init script?  startx came up with
some strange configuration rather than /root/.xinitrc even though
whoami reported 'root'.  had to otherwise su root - startx.

what does su do that it gets an appropriate environment? (home directory?)
