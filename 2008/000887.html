<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>You guys should split this conversation into separate threads.
?stable? as I tend to write it with ?? means that the word is nebulous.
Do you mean old software?
Do you mean software that software authors have released and called stable?
Do you mean software that still compiles?
Do you mean software that compiled before
and does not currently at risk for ELF failure recompilation?

Sorcerer is far more dynamic than a pre-compiled binary based distro.
Consequently, problems occur both when software becomes too new
and when software becomes too old.

An ideal Sorcerer box is one where
all the software required to run can be compiled.
However, due to the tides of software updating
some days the boat floats and someday it does not.
Consequently, I do not try to keep the ship docked.
Let it float deep in the sea.
Just assume it has some holes.
And bail water when it reaches your knee.

Yes there are times when one failed spell or even
the update of a spell will block the entire compilation
of kde or gnome or have really big consequences.
And that is what reporting and fixing is for.
That is how this boat stays afloat.

Because of this process Sorcerer is able to float
from past, to present, to future and spare us the
ordeal of complete re-installation.

However, as I mentioned above if you try to dry dock Sorcerer
to create this ?stable? grimoire then it may become increasingly
difficult to integrate newer sources and older sources.
Pre-compiled binary based distros have less of a problem with this.
Once a package is compiled and made then compilation is no longer a concern.
However, with Sorcerer compilation is always a concern.
And back-porting security fixes is not a picnic.

To achieve a more ?stable? grimoire probably requires someone to
have a very loaded box that updates weekly, recompiles everything,
then reports detected problems and solutions back to grimoire maintainers.
Of course, since each Sorcerer box is unique even that method will
not spot all potential problems.
However, the idea is that a more consistent and thorough testing of
the Sorcerer grimoire will be able to reduce the length of time that
breaks exist in the grimoire.

It is not a perfect solution.  Why?  Because there is no perfect solution.
Bugs and API breaks catch software developers as much by surprise as
they do distribution maintainers and SAs.
And while a pre-compiled binary based distro that has:
testing, stable, freeze, and developmental catalogs may appear more stable
they are also very different from a distribution like Sorcerer.
Source based and pre-compiled binary based distributions have
different strengths and weaknesses.
But that does not make one better than the other.
Only when the task to be performed is considered can one
begin to consider which distro is the best tool for the task.
Afterall, one does not grab a screw driver before realizing
the tasks is to remove a bolt, right?
Same sort of thing.
But I am digressing.

Maximizing Sorcerer's strengths will help it approach optimal performance.
Making it more like a pre-compiled binary based distro will not.
For years I have warned against such things.
&quot;Let's add version information to requirements.  ;)&quot;
No!  Let's not!

To make Sorcerer like a pre-compiled binary based distro will make Sorcerer
slower and weaker and Sorcerer will always fail to be better than
pre-compiled binary based distros at tasks for which
pre-compiled binary based distros excel at.
Instead Sorcerer should be good at what Sorcerer is good at.
If we are just going to copy something, like BSD's portage system,
or Redhat's RPM, then why even bother creating a distro at all?

Now that said I am not against a having a ?stable? contrib grimoire.
But if one tries to model such development after Debian
then disappointment is to be expected.

Now someone wrote that LAG &gt; 0 simply delays the inevitable.
That is not exactly correct.
LAG=7 gives a SA 7 days to
# augur progress
a spell so that their production boxes do not encounter
a problem that they detected on their dev/testing box.
Is that a bad compromise?

What?  You do not run a dev box?
Fine, why not just allocate some extra disk space
to deploy a chrooted Sorcerer installation for testing
at LAG=0 or LAG=1?

At the cost of disks these days we can all afford the spend
the pennies for such a small amount of peace of mind.
Why?  Because in the production environment the boxes must work!

I have done the exact same thing with Debian and with Solaris.
Dev/testing boxes save downtime.
Because they expect the unexpected.

PLAN 1

So in summary:

1. Distribution maintained
2. A supreme pizza box updates weekly and rebuilds weekly.
3. Bug reports from supreme pizza box go back to step 1.
4. SAs run dev boxes at LAG=0 or LAG=1
5. SAs report bugs back to step 1.
6. SAs temporarily avert problems on production boxes using augur progress
7. Production boxes update at LAG=7 and with appropriate augur progress

The end result is that production boxes are ?stable?.

If we put such a plan into action then many bugs/problems should be
detected and squished within 9 days with many of them being eliminated
in under 2 days.

PLAN 2

Another possibility is to adjust how the official grimoire is maintained.
Consider a monthly cycle.
The first day of the month the grimoire is considered most stable.
Days 2-14 version updates are permitted in the grimoire.
Days 14-27 only changes to spells due to bug reports are made.
Days 28-end of month, no changes are made.

With this cycle the LAG on the official grimoire will be eliminated
and the spell adjusted so that the new grimoire version updates only
once a month on the first day of the month.
The construction of the grimoire version would change.
Instead of 2008-339 it would be something like 20081204
This way SAs can use augur progress to install a mid month
grimoire to test and report bugs.

Still with plan 2 SAs are expected to update their dev/testing box
and check for problems before updating their production boxes.
The big disadvantage to plan 2 is that obviously bug fixes and
also important security updates could be delayed for as much
as a month!
Also if SAs do not testing of mid month grimoires then
the first day of the month grimoire will be not be any better
than a grimoire from any random day of the month.

Those are just some rough ideas.
With refinement they can be made better.
Eliminating the delayed security updates from plan 2
could be possible with the addition of a smaller
grimoire that only contains security updates and is
rolled daily like the main grimoire.

I can see you want change.
You want a more ?stable? grimoire.
That is good.
Keep thinking and writing your ideas about it.
There is definitely room for improvement.
When we all decide what it should be
then we can make it happen.

As you consider plans and also write your plans remember that ultimately
the will be evaluated by:

1. effort involved
2. complexity
3. efficiency
4. practicality
5. will someone really do it?

Will someone really maintain complete 3000+ spell contrib grimoire?
Obviously, there are benefits but the effort and complexity may be too high
for that plan to actually be implemented.

Please remember than plans do not have to be perfect.
Being close to perfect is great!
Also there is no one best perfect plan.
Instead we should post some plans
then post evaluations of the plans
and discussion and eventually decide by consensus
what we aught to implement.

I can probably think of a PLAN 3 and a PLAN 4 also,
but I am really interested in reading what you guys want.
Why?  Because I am almost always overly complacent about Sorcerer.

Lastly, proposing a plan modeled after how some pre-compiled binary based
distro works will not be automatically disqualified.
However, plans that play to the strengths of Sorcerer
will probably have more boons and therefore a more favorable evaluation.

I tend to make the evaluation charts listing boons and banes.
However, anyone is welcome to add boons and banes that I missed
or explain why my evaluation is incorrect.
And also if you want to put for the effort to build the evaluation charts
beneath your plans then that will be of great assistance.

That said if you have a very good plan
then it has a very good chance of being implemented.

Personally, I am very excited to see a discussion about how we
can improve the Sorcerer experience for SAs.  :)
Good luck brainstorming your plans.
