<PRE>There is something which eludes me:

I have an unbroken compile log for NVIDIA-Linux-x86

Compile log for NVIDIA-Linux-x86 169.12
Built with sorcery implosion-20080510-1 and gcc 4.3.0
Built on Sun May 11 04:39:55 MST 2008

It was compiled with linux-modular version 2.6.25.2 installed.

I will attempt to recast NVIDIA-Linux-x86 now
to see if there is a compile error.

It compiled fine.

The title of that message thread is:

&quot;Re: 169.09 Nvidia.ko build fails on newest 2.6.24 snapshot&quot;

May I suggest building using linux version 2.6.25.3 ?
It should work using the linux-modular spell.
That is what I have installed.

Thanks for the bug report.
I read that you solved the problem in your last few lines.
Perhaps the problem is a moot point by now for most boxes?
I am not sure if there is any way I should modify the
NVIDIA-Linux-x86 spell while I do not precisely understand
the problem or the cause of the problem.

For the moment it seems best that we continue using
NVIDIA-Linux-x86 version 169.12 because it works with
linux version 2.6.25.2, tested, and probably linux version 2.6.25.3
Also it is the most current stable release of the
NVIDIA pre-compiled Xorg graphics drivers.

</I>&gt;<i> Okay, so with 2.6.25.2 and 173.08 (I tried most of the 169.12, 171.xx

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Booted the older kernel, cleaned up now driver conflicts cause the

</I>&gt;<i> and 173.08 didn't want to build in the older linux... (maybe cause I
</I>&gt;<i> still had 2.6.25.2 in /usr/src/linux?) got rid of all my customized
</I>&gt;<i> spells in /usr/share/sorcery/local, recast linux, recast NVIDIA-linux,
</I>&gt;<i> replaced the switch, and now all is well again :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beware there may be issues with this kernel.
