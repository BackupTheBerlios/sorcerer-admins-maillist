<PRE>I keep telling SAs to
# augur forget
about reconfiguring spells.
Is anyone listening?
;)

In newer sorcery, not yet released,
augur forget will also negate previous invocations of augur always.
However, for now # augur forget $SPELL
is probably what you want.
It also forgets version progress and previously selected options for $SPELL

The reason why so much code is being stacked on
# augur forget
is because the concept of choosing to re-configuring a spell
and re-selecting it as an optional for other spells is confusing.
Also removing the code from cast enables cast to run faster,
because cast -r was rarely if ever executed.

With as many augur commands as there are...

# ls /usr/libexec/sorcery/augur.d | wc -l
67

I had to start doing something to help new SAs get a grip.
Even I tend to forget which augur commands do what.
So there is also a

# augur help $COMMAND

It displays more verbose information about an augur command.
It is useful for when augur commands are changed to do
something different than what they were originally designed for.

I am considering remapping # augur index
for example.
Re-indexing of the grimoire is automatic.
Therefore # augur index is never run by SAs.
However, I could use that command to grant
direct access to the grimoire index for SAs to
view information such as:

# augur index unstable gtk+

That way it could print the unstable version for gtk+ if it is defined
in the gtk+ spell.

I am removing what was previously # augur latest
The output is simply unreadable with 5 or more columns.
Therefore, # augur index
could become a preferred method for SAs to access
indexed spell information without having to always rely
upon separate augur commands such as:
# augur available bash
A SA could type:
# augur av bash

However, I am still thinking about how I want to do it.
Even with direct index access I do not intend to remove
our favorite augur commands like
# augur available
But it might just be able to prevent me having to add
20 new augur commands over the course of the year
to keep up with improvements in version handling.

At the moment I am strongly leaning towards Plan C
and am testing some code involving it.
And while the modifications to sorcery are slight,
the modifications to my version mining system are immense.  :(
And knowing when to move versions from
latest
to
stable
is still an unanswered question.

But at least it will enable adding nearly all possible versions
of interest to a spell so that spells can define versions for:

stable
unstable
secure
latest
