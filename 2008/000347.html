How is using DenyHosts better than using iptables
to control access to ssh and log and drop potential attacks?
The reason I am asking is because I understand how iptables can do that.
However, I have no experience with DenyHosts.
I do not want to conjecture or prejudice myself one way or the other about it.
However, I am under the impression that packet filtering is handled
more efficiently within the kernel rather than user space.

True, I want to drop tcp_wrappers.
But rather than just kicking it straight out of the grimoire
I am opening the topic for discussion and debate.
I hope to arrive at a solution that is both good
in the short term and also good in the long term.
The transition to iptables might be a good solution
for the distant future, because it will not require a
patch to compile like tcp_wrappers does.
And should someone notice a problem with it
we can expect a fix from the linux maintainers.
Afterall, 11 years is a long time for a security
related piece of software to go without a security patch.
And the fact that we use a patch to compile it,
and have since 2005, suggests that tcp_wrappers
is no longer maintained software.

tcp_wrappers may have the comfortable feeling
of an old and familiar cane.
But the termites of time have been eating away at it.
And nobody knows if we can count on it for another decade?
In contrast to iptables...
Sure, there was ipchains before and now iptables.
But the linux kernel still supports ipchains should a SA want to use it.
When the linux kernel switches to whatever replaces iptables
there is a chance that iptables will continue to be maintained
for a while yet to come.

Now at best I have presented only a one sided opinion.
Since I do not use tcp_wrappers I have nothing positive to say about it.
However, I did use it in 1999 and 2000 and thought it was a very
convenient way to restrict access to services.
But that was close to a decade ago.
