That was what I read also.
Yet even a million or so writes is not much.
However, it does suggest that deploying Sorcerer
on 64G USB stick may be worth the extra cost.
The larger the USB, the more free area, the greater the
probability it can re-use the least used areas when writing,
rather than grooving out a section of it.
I also read that defragmenting a filesystem on USB stick
yields no performance gain and increased wear and tear.
That makes sense, since there is no head seek time when
reading files, directories, and fragments.

Perhaps eventually advanced USB memory sticks will be able to
detect and isolated areas that are no longer reliably written?
Better than a USB memory stick slowing turning into Swiss cheese.



&gt;<i> Such high commit values are not necessary. Take for example a 32GB flash
</I>&gt;<i> memory with expectancy of 100,000 writes. If you were to continuosly write to
</I>&gt;<i> this stick at 10MB/s, it would take 3.2e10^8 seconds (~10.1 years) to kill
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
I agree that syslog writes would probably not punish it much
merely because the amount of information written is tiny.
But updating of installed spells causes significant writing.
Not sure if 10 year life span is reasonable.
However a 5 year life span would be sufficient.
I would not be surprised if we retired USB sticks every 5 years
to gain the larger faster version.


&gt;<i> So for a common
</I>&gt;<i> desktop use, I would not worry about killing it at all (in a reasonable time
</I>&gt;<i> frame).
</I>
If that is the case
then we need only determine what the better USB memory stick products are.
We do not want to bust the bank,
but we do not want to go cheap and
receive lousy performance and a short life.


&gt;&gt;<i> As for selecting any 32G USB stick at random?
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the flash cards (and SSDs?) are slow because they do not use DMA or
</I>&gt;<i> only older (and slower) modes. Unfortunately, this information is very
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to get unless buying some pricey memories (several hundreds dollars
</I>&gt;<i> and up).

SanDisk Corp. Cruzer Micro 4GB Flash Drive

Here is something strange.
That is how lsusb identifies it.
However, it is actually a 2G flash drive.
I ran hdparm -tT on it.

 Timing cached reads:   604 MB in  2.00 seconds = 301.60 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   80 MB in  3.00 seconds =  26.66 MB/sec

The results are about what one would expect for an older
slow spin 30G IDE fixed disk.
The IDE drive can do about 30 MB/sec,
but it has a head seek time.
Having no head seek time makes a great improvement
in file access speed on a USB memory stick.
Booting, for example, involves access of many small files
that are located at different places on the disk.
A fixed disk is slow at moving the head in order to read all the files.
The greater maximum throughput of the fixed disk
is always bottle necked by the head seek time.
In contrast the USB memory stick with no head seek time
boots much faster than fixed disk.

My 4 biggest concerns about the USB memory sticks are:
lifespan, connectivity, size, cost.

If lifespan is not an issue anymore
and we have size 32G and 64G
then now is the appropriate time
to redesign Sorcerer deployment
for USB sticks instead of fixed disk.

I am not suggesting a live USB flash drive distro.
No tricks for this.
Instead we will use the USB flash drive same as a fixed disk.
The main differences are:
higher commit value,
always tmpfs for /tmp
never defrag,
and UUID identification of partitions in /etc/fstab and /etc/lilo.conf

The last step may require a little reading.
A UUID is a sequence of bytes to create a universally unique identification.
A UUID is written to a partition.
Then that partition is identifiably by the kernel by UUID.
Even if the kernel renames disks from hda to sda, or, sda to hda
or disks are added or removed, UUIDs will not change.
Therefore, specifying partitions and devices by UUID
instead of /dev/sdd4 will enable them to be properly located
even when the USB stick moves to a different computer.

Using labels might also work, but they may be filesystem dependent?
