<PRE>I definitely agree with buying more watts.
I expect power supply potential wattage output diminishes with use.
Therefore, more watts = longer life.
However, I may be incorrect about that.
If anyone knows for certain that I am incorrect
then please correct me.
But better to have 200 watts to spare than being even 1 watt short.

Still 650 watts is a lot of power.
There are microwave ovens that use less watts.
Also I would rather eat potatoes than power computers with them.
You've seen the potato powered computer website before right?
On the other hand potatoes can probably cook inside a computer case?
&quot;Hey honey, I'm convection baking potatoes for supper tonight
to celebrate KDE's new release.&quot;  :)

Nah, I wouldn't really do it.
Too many toxic chemicals used to make computers.
Speaking of, maybe I should get one of cardboard air fresheners
to slide into the unused 3.5&quot; disk drive.
Ya know, to give it that &quot;new computer&quot; smell.
Which reminds me of how a serious computer enthusiast
diagnoses hardware failures...
*Sniff*sniff*  &quot;Smells expensive, the CPU probably melted.&quot;
*Sniff*sniff*  &quot;A melted cable, easy fix.&quot;
*Sniff*sniff*  &quot;Doughnuts!  You guys ate doughnuts without me?
Don't forget about me on doughnut day!&quot;  ;)

Okay, my jokes are lame.
But I was in such a good humor
that I wanted to spread some around.
