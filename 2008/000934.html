</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm, i am sure i did not unmounted (i only do unmount when i want to 
</I>reboot,
&gt;<i> &gt; so its last thing i do before Done) but might be some other error what 
</I>i
&gt;<i> &gt; did...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, if I did chew gum then navigating the Sorcerer menu driven 
</I>installer
&gt;<i> would be just as automatic and thoughtless for me.
</I>
At this point i think transfer routine is broken. 
For a next version of I/R ISO installer could you make a verify option 
available to check if transfer was ok or not. I think older versions did 
have verify but its gone from current versions?
Also using compile menu and its chroot casting goes show so quickly errors 
so you dont have time to read what error message chroot is saying so also 
could you make some error checking if chroot was ok or not also and 
perhaps capture errors from chroot itself. It would help debugging where 
errors might lie. 

&gt;<i> &gt; But there is shell always available for senior SA's so i dont think 
</I>wizard
&gt;<i> &gt; style installer would be that bad, you can always do manual install 
</I>using
&gt;<i> &gt; shell screen :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Only a few people would anticipate every step required for a manual
</I>&gt;<i> installation.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course if they either knew the Sorcerer init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> or the lsb specifications for the names for scripts/programs used
</I>&gt;<i> for generating initramfs images
</I>&gt;<i> then it would probably be successful.
</I>&gt;<i> However, generating those initramfs images is essential.
</I>
Just make a chroot_cast shell script so if you are using shell to make 
some sort of manual install there is easy way to chroot_cast init-scripts, 
functions, etc...

BTW offtopic question: are we moving some day to use GRUB instead of LILO? 
I like GRUB more because it's boot loader has more flexibility than lilo 
has. 

&gt;<i> &gt; What happened back then, why was it not possible to go back any steps?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No it was just like Bob Finch asked for.
</I>&gt;<i> It was a one way street.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Was it limitations because of installer being a shell script?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, because it was a wizard it did not have the same menus.
</I>
Too bad it was not succesfull. 

&gt;<i> &gt; am ok to use wizard like installer, there should be no objections to 
</I>get
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not convinced about that.
</I>&gt;<i> For example more advanced things might not necessarily be wizard 
</I>supported,
&gt;<i> such as encrypted filesystems, LVM2, mdadm, etc...
</I>
Except for encrypted root, other major distro's wizard like installers do 
support LVM2 and software raid (in a expert mode), they are actually basic 
stuff nowdays, not some advanced senior level stuff ;)
Some distro's like Red Hat Enterprise distro and it's clones like CentOS 
are using LVM2 as default, so normal installer is actually doing LV root, 
etc. 

&gt;<i> &gt; Think i'll just disable password authentication and rely logon only 
</I>with SSH
&gt;<i> &gt; keys.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also SSH listening with a different port than 22 helps agains 
</I>scanners.
&gt;<i> Actually not at all.
</I>&gt;<i> I knew someone who set up an office thinking that.
</I>&gt;<i> Just telnet to a port running ssh and see what it says.  :)
</I>
My point was that there are lot's of SSH scanners, i mean lots of them, 
who does scan port 22 and tries to login with some accounts and passwords, 
thousands and thoudands times in a day. 
So currently it helps to put ssh to different port than 22. And because 
they are using username + password so disabling normal password 
authentication scanners do not have any change to break in if someone is 
using bad password.

&gt;<i> &gt; Thinks its pretty safe unless SSH private key is compromised but they 
</I>are
&gt;<i> &gt; usually password protected (i hope).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So attacker needs to stole private key and then also your private 
</I>password
&gt;<i> &gt; for a key... Not easy task to accomblish.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not everyone puts a password on their ssh keys, right?
</I>
Yes, there are some cases where you take password out of private key, like 
if you use SSH connections in crontab etc.
But anyway i dont see any major problem if using SSH keys instead of 
normal passwords, i dont see that any major security risk.
