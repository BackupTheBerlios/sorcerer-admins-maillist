<PRE>20080501 I/Rs are available for download.
I did over 5 complete boot tests with them.
The problem that Evert Vorster reported about the the previous I/Rs
not properly detecting the I/R CDROM in an old slow CDROM drive has
been circumvented.
These new I/Rs should properly detect the disk,
or spend more than a minute per removable drive trying to detect it.

Also during boot of the I/R a catalog of files
that will be transferred from CDROM to fixed disk is created.
This will keep the CDROM spinning for a while.
It may be a boon on some CDROMs and a bane on others.
If the installer is not working properly while the catalog builds,
simply wait for the catalog to finish before starting /install
Most everyone should be able to immediately type:

root
&lt;enter&gt;
# /install

Because the amount to transfer from CDROM to fixed disk is large
it now displays a percent completion and estimated time to completion.
May be useful for determining how long to go on break. :)

Remember that on the first exit of the disk menu, do not unmount file systems.
Instead, exit to the main menu and enter the compile menu.
This is essential for installing lilo.
Omit the compile menu and the installed box will not boot from fixed disk.
This has probably happened to a few SAs using the previous I/Rs.
This information is also recorded in the readme.txt file which is now
properly world readable.

After answering a few questions during the compile menu execution it
will proceed to cast a few spells.
However, the first spell will take longer than expected to complete.
That is because all of missing archive files for installed spells are
created then.
/var/cache/archive is then populated with *.tar.gz archive files.
Do not try to remove them.
They always come back when the archive feature is enabled.
That may be useful if an update to newer software
fails to provide expected adequate performance.

Although the installer does not explicitly have menus for it
the new installation using linux-modular and initramfs
can allow for some more interesting installs if the SA selects
to create a large enough /boot
Since the initramfs and kernel load from the /boot parition during boot
the root partition could be a logical device rather than physical device
or it could be encrypted provided that the SA creates an init-script that
executes in runlevel S that prompts for a password in order to mount
the encrypted partition.

At the linux documentation project TLDP, there are docs that describe
how to do encrypted / partition and how to set up an encrypted key file
so that the key to / never has to be changed, but the password for the
key file can be easily adjusted in order to change the password the box
uses for /
This can be useful if the computer is a notebook that may be assigned
to different people in the future.

While the installer does not have menus for setting up encrypted and
logical devices
it will be able to use them if you set them up before entering the installer.
In the future it may be different.

Keep in mind that using an encrypted / partition consumes
CPU for disk I/O not unlike running disks with DMA disabled.
It does impact performance.
Also using logical devices and RAIDs depending on
how they are set up will probably also impact performance.
Having / stretched over severals disks might not only degrade
performance and consume additional memory, but may become
a significant problem if one of those disks fails.
Sorcerer on a regular partition still tends to provide the best fixed
disk performance.
