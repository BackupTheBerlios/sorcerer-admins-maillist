<PRE>I do not know if this may be the case,
but has anyone examined if the order of
start for udev/hal with respect to init-scripts is correct.
If hal from svn solves the problem
then perhaps the order is fine?
Alternatively, udevtrigger and/or udevsettle can be made to run both
during sysinit and runlevel, after hal has started.
However, running udevtrigger twice does make make runlevel start slower.

Since Jan has the udev/hal situation fixed for the moment
my thought about it is to continue going forward rather than
retreat and risk unexpected problems.
Consequently, I added a note to udev to remind me to lag
udev updates 5 versions behind current.
That way we will probably receive in the
grimoire udev version 135 when udev version 140 becomes available.

Jan's solution already approaches probably the best fix for the current problem.
However, lagging udev updates might help us avoid the problem in the future.

Also due to very important differences in how udev 130 is compiled
compared to udev 125 I do not want to revert udev and have two
separate udev builds() and/or different udev init-scripts
that I must double check.
Basically, each update of udev using the current build()
is a big wonder as to whether the box will make it through sysinit.
And that is yet another reason why I want to settle on udev 130
for now and months yet to come.

Days like this make me pine for devfs.
Sure some devfs device names were different.
I do not exactly recall how we set mode and permission for it.
But I do remember that it caused no problems for distribution maintainers.

There was an update of udev where before there was a
/sbin/udevtrigger and then there was not.
And /sbin/udevsettle vanished also.
Yet the tasks still had to be accomplished.
Those tasks would from then on forward be invoked
by executing udevadm with parameter trigger or settle
Although a trivial change to make
the realization that change was required did not occur to me
until after I rebooted the test box and was looking at error messages.
It goes to show that udev can almost never be checked carefully enough.
And that is a reason why the spell should be moved forward and not backward
to ensure that the build() and init-scripts and rules are compatible
with the currently installed udev.

However, unless anyone has a serious case for requiring newer udev
then I do not mind lagging udev updates 5 versions behind current
so that hal and other software that requires udev has a chance
to catch up with currently available udev.

udev may be an extra special case for moving forward to solve problems.
However, for most compatibility problems I also recommend moving forward.
The point of a distribution like Sorcerer is to move forward,
to encounter and surmount those challenges when they happen.
Sorcerer is never aiming at a fixed point in time, but at a moving target.
And as we all know, a moving target is harder to hit.
After nearly a decade of practice our aim is not yet perfect,
but it is still improving.

Thanks to everyone giving reports and suggestion solutions
and especially to Jan who has been swimming deep in the udev/hal problem
and bailing water faster than anyone.
