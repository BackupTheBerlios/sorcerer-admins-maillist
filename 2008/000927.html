</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm, i think it did not cast anything at any point. I partitioned 
</I>disk, did
&gt;<i> &gt; format partitions, etc. and transfer files, but i dont recall it did 
</I>any
&gt;<i> &gt; cast operations, so that why i suspect chroot cast did not worked (and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because i did try it manually, chroot /media/root/, and it did not 
</I>find
&gt;<i> &gt; shell, or something. If i recall right, there was indeed no shell at 
</I>/bin...
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps the I/Rs did not successfully transfer?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe the CDs contained errors?
</I>&gt;<i> /media/root/bin/bash should have existed.
</I>
Pretty sure bash was missing, i downloaded from sorcerer.silverice.org and 
download stalled many times, maybe iso image is corrupted? Can you check 
if current I/R iso is corrupted on sorcerer.silverice.org?
 
&gt;<i> &gt; It did transfer files ok, atleast it did not report any errors (ori 
</I>did not
&gt;<i> &gt; see any errors atleast) and when i did goto /media/root/ it was full 
</I>of
&gt;<i> &gt; files/directories, looked ok. Except there was no any point 
</I>/etc/lilo.conf,
&gt;<i> &gt; only those lilo.conf.head, etc, so i manually made lilo.conf using 
</I>them and
&gt;<i> &gt; manually runned lilo command, it has parameter to use directory as 
</I>root
&gt;<i> &gt; directory so it did not needed chrooting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, maybe you did what Evert was anticipating.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps, you transferred files and then continued
</I>&gt;<i> down the disk menu and selected to unmount partitions.
</I>&gt;<i> If the partitions are unmounted then the compile menu
</I>&gt;<i> is either not available on the main menu
</I>&gt;<i> or it can not be entered.
</I>
Hmm, i am sure i did not unmounted (i only do unmount when i want to 
reboot, so its last thing i do before Done) but might be some other error 
what i did... 

&gt;<i> A wizard is not out of the question.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it might implemented as a separate installation script.
</I>&gt;<i> That way SAs have their choice between cake or pie.
</I>&gt;<i> But best to finish the cake before making the pie.
</I>
But there is shell always available for senior SA's so i dont think wizard 
style installer would be that bad, you can always do manual install using 
shell screen :) 

I mean how we can users to use/install Sorcerer if installer is so 
confusing right now that even i who got experice from Linux more than 10 
years and i cant install it using installer :( 

&gt;<i> The newer I/R will have a nearly large single main menu design
</I>&gt;<i> that should help SAs avoid the potential pitfall of unmounting
</I>&gt;<i> the filesystems before compiling required software.
</I>
I think just more internal checks so you can't do dummy things like we 
mortals can do ;) 

&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps more wizard like could be better? Like all others distros does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; installer, they are wizard like. That might be better approach than 
</I>manually
&gt;<i> &gt; selecting menus, etc. thats confusing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Senior level SAs, and especially me, tend not to like to be cornered.
</I>&gt;<i> A wizard is not comfortable.
</I>&gt;<i> Several years ago the design was tried.
</I>&gt;<i> And for issues of it being basically impossible
</I>&gt;<i> to go back any step and make corrections it was abandoned.
</I>
What happened back then, why was it not possible to go back any steps? Was 
it limitations because of installer being a shell script? Behalf myself, i 
am ok to use wizard like installer, there should be no objections to get 
easy installation experience, so where you actually need senior SA level 
based advanced installer? If our object is to install Sorcerer linux we 
should make that it's fast and easy. If you need some advanced, just use 
shell window...

&gt;<i> &gt; Well just wait when i get my new server online so we can virtualize
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; devboxes, allthough testing I/R might be difficult to handle unless i 
</I>make
&gt;<i> &gt; you an access to main linux where virtual servers are runned/created. 
</I>Think
&gt;<i> &gt; i will use KVM, instead Xen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Testing need not require full virtualization.
</I>&gt;<i> I can simply test it using qemu running as my normal user.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, I use qemu and tightvnc to test new I/Rs.
</I>
But its kinda slow, isn't it?

&gt;<i> If possible I prefer not to have any access on that box higher
</I>&gt;<i> than regular user otherwise encounter any problem will seriously
</I>&gt;<i> tempt me to fix it myself.
</I>
Hey, free labor is always good to have ;)

&gt;<i> Also if the account is compromised through an exploit
</I>&gt;<i> then not having it lead to a great problem is a good idea.
</I>
Think i'll just disable password authentication and rely logon only with 
SSH keys. 
Also SSH listening with a different port than 22 helps agains scanners. 
Thinks its pretty safe unless SSH private key is compromised but they are 
usually password protected (i hope).
So attacker needs to stole private key and then also your private password 
for a key... Not easy task to accomblish.

&gt;<i> &gt; I managed to get HDD drivers yesterday, 3 * 750GB SATA 2 drivers, just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; testing them on software raid, RAID5, sequential read speed about 
</I>250MB/sec
&gt;<i> &gt; (thats bytes not bits) at beginning part and end part gives about 
</I>100MB/sec.
&gt;<i> &gt; Will test also RAID10... But with RAID5 i will get 1.5TB space...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wow that is fast.
</I>&gt;<i> The demands of the Sorcerer hosting will be slight.
</I>
Would be nice to see how fast is to compile using a KVM virtualized 
sorcerer and how close to native speed it gets.

&gt;<i> But although that appears fixed the PPR web server
</I>&gt;<i> appears to be displaying php files as plain text
</I>&gt;<i> instead of executing them.
</I>&gt;<i> If not for that it might work, maybe?
</I>
Ops, think i did disabled PHP support from our proxy server... I did 
replace our old proxy with a new server and i think i disabled PHP in that 
process, okay need to fix it...
