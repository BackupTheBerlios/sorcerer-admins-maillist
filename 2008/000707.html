The standard boot loader for Sorcerer boxes is lilo.
Does lilo support FAT?
A FAT partition for /boot might require syslinux.
While I do not mind using syslinux for I/R CDs
I prefer lilo for booting deployed Sorcerer boxes.
FAT would also allow the average windows user
to delete your kernel and initramfs files
in order to make space for their files if
they acquired your USB flash drive,
since they would not know how to repartition it.
Unless ext2 read/write is supported
the average windows user would probably not
modify files on an ext2 filesystem.

If transporting files from M$ boxes is necessary
then having an additional FAT filesystem on the flash drive is possible.

If possible to make the boot partition invulnerable to modification
except when the encrypted / is mounted and booted
then I would like that.
However, at best I could probably only provide something
like a simple check where md5sums of the kernels
and initramfs are checked during runlevel execution.
Naturally, those md5sum would be kept in files on the encrypted /
so that they can not be modified.
This type of check could only detect and report that
files in /boot were modified without authorization.
However, with the box already booted it may be
too late to prevent data theft or the intent
of the person who modified the files on /boot
because the kernel and initramfs have loaded
and already run.

I read that non linux compatible encryption is provided on some flash drives.

Are there reasons why having a FAT /boot would be better than an ext2 boot?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Therefore, the time required to load the kernel

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> mine boots as fast as most hard drives  (course I do have fewer things
</I>&gt;<i> I'm starting up)
</I>
Good to know that loading speed
for initramfs and linux from flash drive by BIOS calls
varies with the BIOS.
