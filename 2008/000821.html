<PRE>I knew someone who bought a 486DX 66Mhz and ran it
for half a year in slow speed with caches disabled and
he never knew because he never went into the BIOS CMOS menu to check.
However, when I gave his box an inspection I adjusted BIOS CMOS
and improved his computer's performance by more than 400%
And that was without any over clocking.
I merely corrected the BIOS CMOS from factory defaults
to what they should properly be.

Definitely, a misconfigured BIOS CMOS can cost an enormous amount
performance and can reduce performance to merely 10% of optimal.
Performance loss may be even more applicable to notebooks which
can throttle down the CPU to 12.5% of maximum speed.

Therefore, I agree that proper tuning is easily worth a few hundred
dollars compared to running a modern computer at 1/3 full speed.

It gives cause to wonder how many computers people are using that
have sub optimally configured BIOS CMOS?
As far as I know linux does not do much if anything to correct it.
However, at least CPU throttling can be set by echoing values to
somewhere in /proc
and MTRRs are properly programmed for
AGP and PCI Express graphics cards by xorg.

I look forward to reading your next article.
I know almost nothing more now than I did in the 1980s about tuning a box.
For all I know maybe there probably are new ways to squeeze more juice?

However, I did see something funny a few years ago.
I found a fixed disk in a box and the fixed disk was called a
&quot;Quantum Fireball&quot;
I wondered how that could possibly sell?
People want their computers to run as cool as possible?
Who would put a fireball inside the case?
Anyway that fixed disk is partial swiss and it's SMART
is too dumb to find and fix it.

Come to think of it your article might do good to have URLs to any
websites that list lemon hardware, like Abit motherboards that have
exploding capacitors, and ATI graphics cards that turn into space heaters,
and power supplies that burst into flames.
I am a total magnet for faulty hardware.
If I buy, it dies.  :)
I need to start reading some lemon lists.
