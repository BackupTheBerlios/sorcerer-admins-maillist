<PRE>Hi there.

Hmm... I like leveraging the power of Sorcery, and have already done some
creative things with augur progress.

Like, I have some spells that I have svn versions of. So, I have a little
script that updates from svn and puts the compressed source in the cache
with $SOURCE-svn in the cache. Then, with augur progress $SPELL svn, I can
cast the svn version.

Granted, there is room for improvement, such as specifying the exact date of
the svn that I want. Still, using the Sorcery tools beats the pants off of
trying to do it all by myself.

Once a month might be a bit frequent for stables, Kyle.
I happily volunteer some time spent compiling all the sources I have
installed and troubleshooting all the compile errors about a month before
each I/R release. More frequent than that and it starts feeling like work.

Also, my life cycle does not quite permit a monthly ... anything, really. I
spend five weeks on board a ship, and the laptop that I run Sorcerer on is
running incredibly light in the spell division, with only about 500 spells
installed. I have not installed anything but KDE4. Anything that requires
KDE3 libs is simply not installed and I try to manage without it. Then I go
home and might only have a few weeks there, but a much more powerful machine
and many, many more spells installed.

So, for me at least, trying to keep to a monthly schedule simply does not
fit. However, if I know a I/R is coming up, then I can juggle my time a
little and re-compile everything and give you reports on what fails and why.

I suppose the I/R is the closest thing we have that would equate to a binary
distro's release and it only makes sense to try and get those as stable as
possible.

When I say stable, I mean compiles without errors, of course. The actual
stability of running the software can only be sorted out by actually running
the software. Most my spare time is now spent editing video, and testing
openmovieeditor svn. Currently it is the only bit of linux software that can
edit the avchd video that my camera produces, so it makes it worth it to get
that nice and stable and tested fully. The libraries that depends on are
also getting put through the wringer, and bug reports go to the various
maintainers.

Hopefully at some time in the future I can come back to you and say that the
following versions of whatever has been tested, tested again, bugs have been
squashed and it works well for me.
Considering the sheer amount of spells in the grimoire, it is humanly
impossible to do testing on each and every one, so I only comment on the
spells I actually use.

Kind regards,
-Evert-

</I>&gt;<i> Instead of just:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> We can have:

</I>&gt;<i> stable
</I>&gt;<i> secure
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That way the latest stable versions can go into latest instead of stable.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if that means that stable becomes a lagged progress then
</I>&gt;<i> at sometime someone has to decide when an available version of software

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The advantages of this method is that it involves only one grimoire,

</I>&gt;<i> and and testing/adding new versions to the latest category would

</I>&gt;<i> Also this plan does not delay nor hinder security updates
</I>&gt;<i> when such updates are made to stable/secure/latest all at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i> However, someone still has to test and decide when to promote from
</I>&gt;<i> latest to stable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This type of plan can be integrated also with the 2nd of my previously
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned plans.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, the days of the month when versions can be added to latest
</I>&gt;<i> and stable can be restricted.
</I>&gt;<i> Overall we could end up doing more work to try to create a more
</I>&gt;<i> ?stable? grimoire
</I>&gt;<i> and it might become more ?stable? or it might not.
