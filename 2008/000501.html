</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Very true.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, having /etc/X11/xorg.conf can still be useful.

</I>
I may be wrong about it or it may have changed,
but it seemed that in the past some modules,
such as DRI are not loaded,
or not given a mode that
enables as user to use DRI.

However, upon inspecting a recently created
/root/xorg.conf.new
it has a more complete module section than I expected.
It is different than what is generated by running xorgconfig

However, it does not have a DRI section
and it does not specify resolutions for color depths.
Not sure if that makes merely one resolution available
or all that may be supported by BIOS calls?

And if more than one driver option is available such as the choices
between s3virge, s3, and vesa then a configuration file may be useful
for making that selection permanent.


&gt;<i> and... not in a I/R sort of sense...
</I>
Right, if /boot/isolinux/ exists then
/etc/X11/xorg.conf is not auto-generated.
Would be useless if the I/Rs deployed
with an /etc/X11/xorg.conf


&gt;<i> in a system configuration sense yes -  I'd like a nice right click in
</I>&gt;<i> the desktop manager - display properties, advanced...
</I>
It surprises me that compared to other operating systems GUI
that X can not change color depth while running.
Or is the problem that I never learned how?


&gt;<i> modelines fb.modes is required with uvesafb (fbset)  btw - casting
</I>&gt;<i> fbset does not give me fb.modes
</I>
No idea how to automatically generate mode lines.
When all else failed I used to try to look them up on the WWW.
Any ideas how to make that a bit more automatic?


&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, having an /etc/X11/xorg.conf that mostly works
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to begin with is easier than launching X and then trying to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tweak the or adjust the mode after X is launched.
</I>&gt;<i> tweak? mouse clicks on stuff, keyboard types stuf....
</I>
For a short while I had a mouse with 2 wheels and 5 or more buttons.
However, the default button assignments for the wheels was incorrect.
I could either correct that in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
or I could correct it using xmodmap
Either way I used one configuration file or the other.


&gt;&gt;<i> I do no longer recall the name of the utility that does that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> nvidia-settings
</I>
Now I forgot the question.
But I did not have that answer in mind
since it requires the pre-compiled binary drivers from nvidia.
Wish I had not thought about it.
The capacitors on my nvidia card exploded last week.
However, having bought it from a decent computer store
they handled the RMA for me since I bought it in January.

Perhaps what nvidia cards require most is some sort of physical
barrier that can be installed between the card and the capacitors
so that when it detonates it does not also destroy adjacent hardware?

I did wonder why how when I switched over to a S3virge PCI graphics
card and enabled MTRR for it's memory range that typing gmail email
in firefox was so slow?
I could easily type many characters if not lines ahead of what was displayed.
Even 300 baud mode connections were faster than that.
But I was surprised that the graphics card had a performance impact
with a task that does not seem that it should be graphic intensive.


&gt;<i> yeah - but in a bare box... it's a good point of capaiblity - I
</I>&gt;<i> thought it was just vmware that was giving me like 1600x1200 screen...
</I>&gt;<i> 1920x1600 ? (yeah I guess my laptop is really only 1920x1200 so... I
</I>&gt;<i> guess it's best fit width)
</I>
1920x1200 on a notebook?
Impressive resolution.
But pixiels would be more tiny than I can see.
I would still rather have 2048x768 spread out over two old 17&quot; monitors.
I wonder how long before notebooks support dual monitor configurations,
while not counting the notebook display as a monitor.

You made good points.
xorg is nearly to the point where it can be launched without
/etc/X11/xorg.conf and be nearly as usable as it would be with
a more precise configuration file.
Perhaps in a year or two it will become better?
