<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Someone on the libtool email list mentioned that dash is a fast shell.
I compiled and compared multiple executions of a short quick script using
dynamically linked bash and statically linked dash.
dash was 6x faster for a meager cost of 600K space.
Not a bad choice for booting boxes that run many tiny init-scripts.
Therefore, I rewrote the init-scripts that execute during sysinit to use dash.

Init-scripts can be written either using dash or bash.
I am not forcing the use of just one or the other.

init-scripts that use bashism should begin with
#!/bin/bash

and init-scripts using merely dash syntax should begin with
#!/bin/dash

However, beware that dash does not support the exact same syntax as bash.
Also paths of code that do not execute
may contain bugs that dash does not report.

Because of the wonderfulness of bash
the sorcery tools will not be converted to dash.
Doing so would cause a loss of speed and performance as some
functionality that can be performed internally in bash must be delegated
to external helper programs such as sed when scripts are re-written for dash.

The modifications, bug fixes, and optimizations related to expediting
the execution of sysinit have been thoroughly tested multiple times on
a box that boots using initramfs.
It should work also on traditional boxes that boot without initramfs.
However, that has not been tested.

When boxes update and receive the new init-fuctions, initramfs,
init-scripts spells, etc...
please also check that dash compiles and installs properly.
Not having /bin/dash would halt a box during boot
and require a skilled SA booting with kernel parameters:

rdinit=/bin/bash

or

init=/bin/bash

to sedit all the /bin/dash to /bin/bash in /etc/init.d/* such as:

# sed -i 's:/bin/dash:/bin/bash:' $( find /etc/init.d -maxdepth 1 -type f )

Then execute; if booting with initramfs

# exec /init

or booting traditionally

# exec /sbin/init

Since nobody wants to take the pain,
be certain that dash installs properly.
If not then sedit the scripts in
/etc/init.d/ before issuing the shutdown -r reboot

Now for the simple explanation.
dash scripts are compatible with bash.
bash scripts are not necessarily compatible with dash.
Therefore, reverting to bash is possible and not problematic for
init-script execution.

Please report problems.
A hard copy of the above instructions would
be useful for fixing a box that derailed during sysinit.

Since dash is also used by ubuntu for running init-scripts
I expect that dash will probably be maintained and bug-fixed
at least until a better method or shell becomes prevalent.
However, since bash is dash compatible
should dash become unavailable
then boxes can be switched back to /bin/dash
for execution of init-scripts.
Therefore, this change gains both a bit of speed
while not denying an expeditious retreat should
the change become woeful.

Boons: faster; easy to undo
Banes: loss of convenient familiar bashism syntax; bugs may be more
difficult to spot

The change balances about 50/50.
Was the effort to make it happen worth the benefit?
Probably not.
However, as more init-scripts are added
the speed benefit increases.
