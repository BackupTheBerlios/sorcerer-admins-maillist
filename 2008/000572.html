<PRE>/etc/init.d/networks is like cron

cron will run a program at a specific time.
cron will not pass command line parameters
to the program that cron executes.
How can the cronjob executed program
receive command line parameters?
Have cron invoke a bash script.
Have the bash script invokes the program
with proper command line parameters.
This is exactly the same thing.

Why make an ultra complicated
/etc/init.d/networks script that supports EVERYTHING?
All the SA must do is write a single bash script fragment
that raises the networking devices
whether it be 1 2 or 65536 network adapters.
It does not matter.
Just put that one script in
/etc/networks.d/
And it is done.

I have exactly an example where I raise two network adapters.
The script is called go

# cat /etc/networks.d/go
. /etc/networks.d/both/wlan0-static $1
. /etc/networks.d/both/eth0-static $1

Very simple, yes?
I am not trying to make networking difficult.
I am trying to make it easy.
This is easy, yes?

The above point excluded,
I agree with you that  networking should be improved.
Although /etc/init.d/networks is considerably long
for a Sorcerer init-script that part seems okay.
The troublesome part obviously is for SAs being
able to figure out how to set up networking using
the templates.

Perhaps the networks spell should include a menu
driven process that asks SAs plenty of questions
in order to automatically fill out those templates
and move them properly so that networking can
be configured without the SA having to visit
/etc/networks.d/

However, the aspect that lacks consensus
is the networking templates!
I suspect that most SAs do not
merely fill in the variables in the network templates,
but also modify the network templates.
And it was designed to be completely modifiable so
that SAs can configure networking exactly as they want.
But that is what causes the problem.
The absolute maximum amount of configuration provided
requires too great of a skill check.
It should have a better compromise between
the ability to configure and simplicity.

I know at least one Sorcerer SA that dislikes the networks
method for use on his notebook that he starts networking
using something else entirely.

And SAs who are familiar with udev may have already
written rules so that udev can start networking.

There is not as if there is one way to do this
nor a proper way, nor a proper time to start networking.
That is why I want this discussion re-opened.
Ideas for improvement are invited, please.
