<PRE>The /lib64 and /usr/lib64 directories were a bad idea to begin with.
The majority of free software authors do not support it.
Some programs will not work when their files are moved */lib to */lib64
Some libraries require adjustments to their libtool and pkgconfig
files in order to be moved.
Not every source supports --libdir=/usr/lib64

Therefore, what you have for Sorcerer x86_64 is
very much what the original software authors intended
and not something where I am trying to force libraries
to be installed in lib64 directories.

Even today I am doing compilation in qemu-system-x86_64
I might not have enough CPU cycles to keep the I/R current.
It is currently compiling gcc-v4.2 with 6 more spells waiting.

Because I do not run Sorcerer x86_64
and do not do compile testing on x86_64
I rely upon Jan to make x86_64 appropriate fixes to spells
whether it be to make them compile or to install into lib64 directories.
And I have not instructed anyone to try to force lib64 directories.

If I had an x86_64 box
then Sorcerer x86_64 would be a better port.
For now, if you report problems
then you will receive fixes.
The fix that went out in yesterday's grimoire
that has NVIDIA-Linux-x86 remove MesaLib libGL libraries
should fix the OpenGL problem.
I wish we had that fix the first moment
I wrote the NVIDIA-Linux-x86 spell.
But I have never cast that spell on x86_64, nor tested it on x86_64.
I merely fix it according to bug reports.

Without Jan's long hours that he spent on creating
and fixing the x86_64 port
I expect we would not have Sorcerer x86_64.
And I want everyone to know that other people told me
that they would create a Sorcerer port for xbox,
a port for PowerPC, and a port for Alpha,
and a port for Sparc.
NOT EVEN ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE DELIVERED!
A staggering majority of the people who said that
they would help me with Sorcerer lied to me.
Jan is beyond average, beyond exceptional!
We are lucky to have Jan on the team.
He does a great job.
If I do something that seems questionable or bugged
he is fast to find and fix it.
Makes him darn close to being the guardian angle of Sorcerer.

If you want to force lib64 directory installation for spells
please test the adjust spells to make certain they do not break
then report those findings on the email list or to Jan directory.
If such changes are not done with testing and caution
then the x86_64 port could break and crumble,
and if the break was bad enough
then I would not be able to fix it without
at least a weeks worth of time while borrowing
someone's x86_64 box.
Let it not come to that please.

P.S.

&#31036;&#31036;&#31036; Jan!
Hip-Hip-Hurray Jan!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; after long time I found some time to test again the compiz on x86_64
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; sorcerer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; looking the forums I found several information that weren't usefull
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; until I read somewhere that it might comme from compiz linking against
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; mesa and not nvidia libGL....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ldd $(which compiz) told me that it was using the lib in /usr/lib64
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (looked good)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; augur install NVIDIA-Linux-x86 told me that driver install lib in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; /usr/lib
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ls -la /usr told me that /usr/lib isn't a symlink to /usr/lib64 and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; a regular directory....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; looking into /usr/lib makes me worry because it contains LOT of libs,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; all comming from spells (since It' s a scratch install)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I'm able to run compiz with :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libGL.so.1 compiz --replace ccp &amp;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; PROBLEMS :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 1) /usr/lib and /usr/lib64 both exist, both store the same kind of files
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (64bits libs)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 2) NVIDIA drivers install in /usr/lib.... not sure it's a good place....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
