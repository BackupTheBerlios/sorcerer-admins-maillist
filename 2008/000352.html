I was reasonably certain it as the other way around.
If the root filesystem exists on a logical volume
then mount can not execute until lvm does.
And mount should not execute until fsck does.
Therefore, lvm should occur before fsck and
consequently before mount.
If that order is incorrect
then please explain why lvm should execute after fsck and mount?


&gt;<i> was going to complain there was no modprobe... but /sbin isn't in the

</I>
modprobe now executes
after udev in runlevels 1 2 3 4 5.
There are two reasons for that.
Initially, the initramfs did not have a complete set of modules
for the loading kernel, although now it does.
Second, udev is assumed to load the necessary modules for
devices and filesystems in order to properly clear sysvinit

It is now possible to move modprobe to sysinit
if you prefer and have it execute before or after udev.
Of course, I prefer a good reason to make the change
so I can feel some assured that I am will be avoiding
more problems than it causes.  :)


&gt;<i> S00proc doesn't mount proc?
</I>
Sure it does.

&gt;<i> it gets into lsb/init-functions, is testing something like mount...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> parse start
</I>&gt;<i> case &quot;$1&quot; instart
</I>&gt;<i> case $SERV in
</I>&gt;<i> startm
</I>&gt;<i> sed 's/#.*//' /etc/fstab [filters down to not commented lines I guess]
</I>&gt;<i> grep -qw /proc
</I>
Oh, right...  Now that is a bug.
And a potentially bad bug at that.

You have /proc in /fstab
So S00proc did not mount proc.
Thanks for spotting that.
Obviously, checking for /proc /sys /dev in /etc/fstab is unwise.
Thanks for finding it and pointing it out.
I did not discover it because my /etc/fstabs were already adjusted
to not include virtual filesystems.
I created a backward incompatibility when I generalized
the mounting for virtual filesystems.

&gt;<i> Also, isn't there a ';' missing after 'then log_success_msg  &quot;$NAME mounted&quot;
</I>
';' is not required there

If it was missing ';' then a bash error message would occur.

&gt;<i> so S00proc start doesn't do anything
</I>&gt;<i> neither does S00sys
</I>
I estimate the 3 virtual fileystems that should not have an /etc/fstab
check are:
/proc /sys /dev because all 3 would probably be mounted before
the mount init-script executes.

Thanks for the bug reports.
