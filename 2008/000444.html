<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again, XDM does not have an option to auto login. I do not WANT gdm or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kdm - as I do not need all their additional bloat of gnome or kde
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libraries.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and yes - option to start networking in S level would have fixed my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue also (which was what I was originaly going to do)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did you take a good look at those scripts xdm installs?
</I>&gt;<i> I would not wager that xdm can not be configured for kiosk use.
</I>&gt;<i> And it is considerably light weight compared to kdm and gdm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I did MUCH searching on this.  There were a few custom hacks and
patches as late as december 2007, but otherwise xdm requires the login
stage.  I attempted to put my processes on the setup side before the
init is done, after the process terminated, it continued to the
login.... even with a few exec's thrown in to try and tke over the
process

&gt;<i> But you would not require xdm for something so simple.
</I>&gt;<i> Merely creating a login environment, starting X, and having
</I>&gt;<i> it execute a window manager should work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let us see something like....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #!/bin/bash
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> start(){
</I>&gt;<i>  while : ; do /bin/su - guest -c startx; done &amp;
</I>&gt;<i>  sleep 0.1
</I>&gt;<i>  echo &quot;$!&quot; &gt; /var/run/xguest
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
that sort of script would cause startup to hang, as it expects scripts
to terminate before moving on to the next one.

&gt;<i> And put the WM and other commands to run in
</I>&gt;<i> ~/guest/.xinitrc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> exec the window manager last
</I>&gt;<i> Have the programs begin before it backgrounded.
</I>&gt;<i> The example in startx gives an excellent example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is no auto restart when running startx.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when X exits, it exits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could loop the window manager in ~/.xinitrc
</I>&gt;<i> But if the user zaps the X server or it crashes
</I>&gt;<i> then it is gone.
</I>&gt;<i> Using a wrapper script like the one I wrote as
</I>&gt;<i> an example above can continually restart the
</I>&gt;<i> X server as guest and with the PID saved
</I>&gt;<i> it can be killed when no longer wanted.
</I>&gt;<i> Do not forget the sleep.
</I>&gt;<i> BASH can not grant PIDs for recently backgrounded processes.
</I>&gt;<i> An wait of an undetermined amount of time is required
</I>&gt;<i> before using $!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is NO auto login option for xdm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Option? What option? I meant edit the scripts in
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/X11/xdm/ in order to make it do a kiosk login.
</I>&gt;<i> But a wrapper script around startx is probably easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that's pretty much my point... I would rather that my startx was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maintained by inittab.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but a really stupid simple script works...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> --- watch_task --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> #!/bin/bash
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> echo $(date) restarting $* &gt;&gt;/tmp/watch_task.log
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $0 $* &amp;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is simple?
</I>&gt;<i> I have no clue what it does.
</I>
$* is all arguments from 1 forward...
$0 iis the script itself

&gt;<i> script.whatever  execute these as a command
</I>
would run 'execute' with 'these as a command' as arguments then run
the script itself whatever its name was, with the same arguments it
was given in the first place.  And echoes that it's restarting
somewhere in the middle.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the servers installed by
</I>&gt;<i> sorcery-immune sorcery-bgz demonstrate
</I>&gt;<i> how a BASH script can be made into a daemon.
</I>&gt;<i> Technically, leech and cast are also daemons
</I>&gt;<i> or something similar since they execute in the background.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, they are not started at boot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not really an issue, but it is a custom hack rather than a standard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> utility to restart a task.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That circles around to one of my original questions.
</I>&gt;<i> Should something that provides this functionality be
</I>&gt;<i> provided in init-functions?
</I>&gt;<i> First, I am not certain that with only one example of
</I>&gt;<i> what want it to do that we can make it into a standard.
</I>&gt;<i> In order to standardize mounting of virtual filesystems
</I>&gt;<i> there were more than 5 places where virtual filesystems
</I>&gt;<i> would be mounted and all those scripts worked out to
</I>&gt;<i> do almost entirely the same thing.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, it was much like recognizing it as a macro
</I>&gt;<i> and then defining that macro in init-functions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, with only one example of what we want looped
</I>&gt;<i> that does not provide enough of an idea of how it should
</I>&gt;<i> be made standard.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, you seem to be on track with writing a custom
</I>&gt;<i> init-script to handle that specific case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm.... but now I do have a bit of an itch from this discussion.
</I>&gt;<i> Should a spell be created that requires startx that
</I>&gt;<i> will create a guest user and group when cast and will
</I>&gt;<i> provide automatic kisok login for user guest?
</I>&gt;<i> Of course what programs are started and what window
</I>&gt;<i> manager are started would depend upon
</I>&gt;<i> ~/guest/.xinitrc
</I>&gt;<i> A default one could be provided similar to the example
</I>&gt;<i> that is given in startx that executes twm,
</I>&gt;<i> the window manager, for the window manager.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Btw - there were issues with the default twm configurations - it is
missing a font... or a font that matches the default specification - I
had fixed it on the dev systems, ut the system that were deployed
didn't get the fix, and i can't use twm on them ...

&gt;<i> That seems like a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i> I will go ahead and do that.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I will consider the name of the spell
</I>&gt;<i> and account name and other details a little longer
</I>&gt;<i> before I write the spell.
</I>&gt;<i> I am considering putting an account and group of guest
</I>&gt;<i> in the 512 to 1023 range because it is a role account
</I>&gt;<i> rather than a service account ( 256 =&gt; 512 ) and not a
</I>&gt;<i> user account ( 1024 &gt;= 65534 )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anything else you want with it?
</I>&gt;<i> Banana peppers, jalapeno peppers, green and red peppers?
</I>&gt;<i> I am in the mood for a sub sandwich.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose I will call it xguest.
</I>&gt;<i> That seems to be available and it seems a decently
</I>&gt;<i> enough descriptive name without being verbose.
</I>&gt;<i> Besides it took me way to long to learn how to spell kiosk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose if anyone has a need for a similar spell that
</I>&gt;<i> uses a different account name than guest
</I>&gt;<i> then they will probably want to further customize it
</I>&gt;<i> than merely adjust the name and will write it into their
</I>&gt;<i> local grimoire as a custom spell.
</I>&gt;<i> At least having the example spell will ease the task
</I>&gt;<i> for SAs that have not set up a kiosk style auto-login.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
while that's all well and good ... would I then just put the programs
I wanted started in like .bashrc ?  well no, there's not nessecarily a
shell run to start X
and X itself is pretty boring.

not really sure that it would help the amateur or the expert ?

&gt;<i> I will copy this into my todo file.
