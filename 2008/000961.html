No you have a good point.
Nearly everything in Sorcerer is optional for SAs.
SAs do not have to use grimoire spells.
They can write their own spells.
They can modify nearly any aspect about any of
the sorcery tools simply by writing their own replacement
functions in /etc/sorcery/local.config
They can exile from installation software that is
listed as mandatory requirements on spells.
They can use the provides system to state that spell
B provides spell C even if it does not.
SAs are not even forced to sync their boxes regularly.
SAs not syncing regularly can occasionally cause problems.
Therefore, if legacy progress support was introduced
SAs would have to:
# augur progress $SPELL legacy
in order to switch a spell over to legacy progress.
However, I do not want to add bulk to sorcery that
has no chance of anyone ever using it.

The sorcery tools are decent since they require a meager
71K to download, run very fast, and provide the building
blocks for SAs to achieve what they want.
The reason I wrote the tools in BASH was not because
I was awesome at writing BASH scripts.
When I started writing sorcery
I was just as unskilled with BASH as are most SAs.
I selected BASH because every senior level SA
should be at least adequate with wielding BASH
while knowledge of C, C++, and other languages is optional.
Some SAs goes their entire careers without compiling even one source file.
Since the tools are in BASH
SAs can easily read, and modify and use
without the hassle of re-compilation.

The few tools I wrote for Sorcerer that are in C
are sdelta, sdelta3 and sentinel.
For some tasks a mid level compiled programing language is required.

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 14K 2007-10-07 22:42 /usr/bin/sdelta3
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 5.6K 2008-07-04 16:22 /usr/libexec/sorcery/sentinel

As demonstrated above
I also prefer an efficient and fast approach
to handling programming tasks in C.

The use sentinel with sorcery is obligatory.
I used to support strace also.
But strace has a near 20% CPU overhead.
In contrast sentinel's overhead can not easily be measured.
At one time sorcery supported DESTDIR.
However, some spells like gtk+ install entirely different.
The surprise that came from gtk+ convinced me that
sentinel is better than trying to make sorcery more like
a package manager.

Even the debian's method is also
to use a library override
that is similar to sentinel.
However, instead of tracking
installation and modification of files
Debian's fakeroot redirects file writes and modifications.
I also considered using something like plasticfs
or other methods of redirecting modifications.
However, for concerns of stability sentinel should be kept
because sentinel has performed rock solid for years.


&gt;&gt;<i> Second question is &quot;Should pbzip2 be remade as an exclusive provider for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bzip2?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As long as it really is backwards compatible with bzip2, I say go for it.
</I>
The reason I hesitate is that it may have bugs.
Something as important as bzip2 being bugged up
might annoy SAs who can not easily detect where
the problem is coming from.
However, since many modern boxes are dual core or more
the use of pbzip2 is attractive.
Perhaps a good compromise is to wait one more release
of it or 3 months to see if any more bugs are shook out of it?
But when I do make it a drop in replacement for bzip2
I want to know that I have Sorcerer SA support.
Because if it is buggy I do not want to be blamed
for having made an unwise and unnecessary change
that caused instability and problems with Sorcerer.


&gt;<i> Season's greetings to all (as they say in muslim countries),
</I>&gt;<i> Antoine Chassagnard
</I>
Thanks and to every one else also Seasons greetings.
I expect most Sorcerer SAs will be out of the office until
probably January 2nd.
I am still doing compilation updates for the x86_64 I/R
I have not begin testing new I/Rs yet.
The chances for one last I/R release in 2008 are looking slim.
