<PRE>Indexing in qemu makes a big difference on a virtual machine.

qemu-system-x86_64 still requires about 4 minutes
to generate a full index while running full bore on about an ia32 2Ghz
Full indexing on the native CPU requires only a few seconds.

However, the index on an ia32 and an x86_64 are almost identical.
A few attributes and sources differ.
Therefore, if desired importing an index from another box
onto a virtual machine will probably work.

A time not long ago, I wanted to provide an index with the grimoire.
However, since svn does not properly replicate time stamps
I have since decided not to provide any pre-generated index files,
but instead hone indexing speed.

Indexing now is much faster than I expected was possible.
However, do not yet hold your breath while generating
a full index using a virtual machine.
At native speeds blink and you may miss it.
At virtual speeds hold your breath and your life may complete before indexing.

linux-modular compilation native = a few hours.
linux-modular compilation virtual = a week.
Consequently, Sorcerer on virtual/emulated machines
is generally not an efficient use of CPU cycles.

No matter how honed sorcery becomes
the slowness of executing on a virtual machine
may be impossible to directly overcome.
