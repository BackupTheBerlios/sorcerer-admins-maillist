A-okay.

&gt;<i> Hmm, i am sure i did not unmounted (i only do unmount when i want to reboot,
</I>&gt;<i> so its last thing i do before Done) but might be some other error what i
</I>&gt;<i> did...
</I>
Well, if I did chew gum then navigating the Sorcerer menu driven installer
would be just as automatic and thoughtless for me.


&gt;<i> But there is shell always available for senior SA's so i dont think wizard
</I>&gt;<i> style installer would be that bad, you can always do manual install using
</I>&gt;<i> shell screen :)
</I>
Only a few people would anticipate every step required for a manual
installation.
Of course if they either knew the Sorcerer init-scripts
or the lsb specifications for the names for scripts/programs used
for generating initramfs images
then it would probably be successful.
However, generating those initramfs images is essential.


&gt;<i> I mean how we can users to use/install Sorcerer if installer is so confusing
</I>&gt;<i> right now that even i who got experice from Linux more than 10 years and i
</I>&gt;<i> cant install it using installer :(
</I>
It is okay, I do manual installs from time to time also.
If there is a bug in the installer I will find it next time.


&gt;&gt;<i> The newer I/R will have a nearly large single main menu design
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that should help SAs avoid the potential pitfall of unmounting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the filesystems before compiling required software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think just more internal checks so you can't do dummy things like we
</I>&gt;<i> mortals can do ;)
</I>
Unfortunately, I can not anticipate every potentially unusual input.


&gt;<i> What happened back then, why was it not possible to go back any steps?
</I>
No it was just like Bob Finch asked for.
It was a one way street.


&gt;<i> Was it limitations because of installer being a shell script?
</I>
Actually, because it was a wizard it did not have the same menus.


&gt;<i> Behalf myself, i
</I>&gt;<i> am ok to use wizard like installer, there should be no objections to get
</I>&gt;<i> easy installation experience, so where you actually need senior SA level
</I>&gt;<i> based advanced installer? If our object is to install Sorcerer linux we
</I>&gt;<i> should make that it's fast and easy. If you need some advanced, just use
</I>&gt;<i> shell window...
</I>
I am not convinced about that.
For example more advanced things might not necessarily be wizard supported,
such as encrypted filesystems, LVM2, mdadm, etc...
And personally, I do not like running those tools from command line.
So I prefer the menus for a less than trivial installation.


&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Well just wait when i get my new server online so we can virtualize
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; devboxes, allthough testing I/R might be difficult to handle unless i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; you an access to main linux where virtual servers are runned/created.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; i will use KVM, instead Xen.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Testing need not require full virtualization.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can simply test it using qemu running as my normal user.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Currently, I use qemu and tightvnc to test new I/Rs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But its kinda slow, isn't it?
</I>
Not for just booting an I/R, transferring files, and doing initial compilation.
It is slow, but I do not require a whip lash experience.  :)


&gt;&gt;<i> If possible I prefer not to have any access on that box higher
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than regular user otherwise encounter any problem will seriously
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tempt me to fix it myself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hey, free labor is always good to have ;)
</I>
Also my neck if I mess it up.
With great root comes great responsibility.
Right?
Yeah, I'm making fun of spiderman movies.


&gt;<i> Think i'll just disable password authentication and rely logon only with SSH
</I>&gt;<i> keys.
</I>&gt;<i> Also SSH listening with a different port than 22 helps agains scanners.
</I>Actually not at all.
I knew someone who set up an office thinking that.
Just telnet to a port running ssh and see what it says.  :)

&gt;<i> Thinks its pretty safe unless SSH private key is compromised but they are
</I>&gt;<i> usually password protected (i hope).
</I>&gt;<i> So attacker needs to stole private key and then also your private password
</I>&gt;<i> for a key... Not easy task to accomblish.
</I>
Not everyone puts a password on their ssh keys, right?


&gt;<i> Would be nice to see how fast is to compile using a KVM virtualized sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> and how close to native speed it gets.
</I>
I am sure it should be decent.


&gt;<i> Ops, think i did disabled PHP support from our proxy server... I did replace
</I>&gt;<i> our old proxy with a new server and i think i disabled PHP in that process,
</I>&gt;<i> okay need to fix it...
</I>
Thanks for trying to fix it.
If it works I will notice, if not then I will stare at it for a while longer.
With as much as is going on, baby sitting the PPR is not a top priority.
