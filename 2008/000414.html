<PRE>The next I/R is already under construction.
It will have support for creating LUKS encrypted partitions.
Yes even / can be an encrypted partition.
And also dedicated swap partitions can be encrypted.

Also the next I/R will support EVMS, enterprise volume management system.
EVMS can use the device-mapper in order to restructure disk and/or partitions
into groups which can be accessed as single volumes.
Using EVMS is not required.
fdisk is still available for disk partitioning.

Lastly, the grimoire is being adjusted so that libselinux is no longer optional.
Eventually, all boxes will update to having libselinux support and
Linux-PAM installed.
Yes Linux-PAM is required for use with libselinux.
However, libselinux also requires a kernel compiled with libselinux
support enabled,
otherwise a libselinux box acts just like an normal box.

linux-modular version 2.6.25.1 will be selinux enabled.
It will boot with selinux enabled.
However, it will be in permissive mode and therefore merely
log denials of access instead of enforcing them.
Of course it can be boot with kernel parameter:
selinux=0
to entirely disable selinux support.

The move to supporting selinux is due to several factors.
selinux support has been in the vanilla linux kernel for a while.
grsecurity did not make it into the linux kernel.
Almost all of the sources for utilities that require selinux patches,
except sysvinit, have had those patches merged into their vanilla sources.
Many major distributions have selinux support already.
Most of the spells required for selinux, except refpolicy,
already existed in the Sorcerer grimoire.
Basically, selinux has been sitting half baked
in the Sorcerer grimoire for years.
In theory it was usable if a SA could acquire the missing parts
such as default policies and a patched sysvinit.
But I doubt anyone bothered to try selinux on Sorcerer.

For those not familiar with selinux it enables restricting what
files can be read, written, and run by several different means
besides the traditional owner group and mode.
To begin with it uses the extended attributes.
And for that reason it must be installed on ext2, ext3, xfs, or jfs
with extended attributes enabled.
Much reading is required to learn how to wield selinux
You may want to start with:

<A HREF="http://www.lurking-grue.org/selinuxHOWTO.html">http://www.lurking-grue.org/selinuxHOWTO.html</A>
<A HREF="http://www.lurking-grue.org/writingselinuxpolicyHOWTO.html">http://www.lurking-grue.org/writingselinuxpolicyHOWTO.html</A>

I am still reading those.

linux-modular 2.6.25.1 will also have support for: smack
It is a less complicated alternative to selinux
<A HREF="http://www.schaufler-ca.com/">http://www.schaufler-ca.com/</A>
smack-utils is already in the grimoire.
Not certain what else is required in order to configure and use smack yet.
I decided I would concentrate on selinux first and smack second
to make it seem like a downhill run.


<A HREF="http://www.saout.de/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=EncryptedDeviceUsingLUKS">http://www.saout.de/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=EncryptedDeviceUsingLUKS</A>

I nearly forgot, but that is the wiki for LUKS.
Unfortunately, it is not absolute correct about the file commands/parameters.
But it is incredibly easy to set up a LUKS encrypted partition
which can have up to 8 simultaneous separate passwords to enable it.
The init-script is already available in the grimoire to enable them during boot.
To start using it be certain that cryptsetup version 1.0.6 is installed
and /etc/init.d/luks exists.

The next I/R should be entertaining even for Sorcerer veterans.
Here are some potential challenges to try:

Try making filesystems on logical groups instead of physical partitions.
Try making encrypted / installations.
Try setting up a box with full and functional selinux support that
does not lock you into a corner as soon as enforcing mode is enabled.

selinux, it is probably best enabled and enforced on servers rather
than workstations.
Many daemons/services still run as root.
A successful exploit of a root run daemon may give the attacker root
access to a box.
However, if selinux is properly configured then the &quot;identity&quot; running
that daemon
may only have only limited access to the files that the daemon would
normally access.
Therefore, if the attack was upon a webserver then the attacker might
only gain the ability
to corrupt and modify hosted webpages and websites.
If the attack was upon an email server then only email might be effected.
However, the attacker would not gain the ability to modify /etc/shadow
or other files installed in / and /usr, etc...
selinux seems like locking processes inside of a shatterproof glass boxes.
With selinux installed root != root.
roles help control access.

It is probable that attacks designed to gain root will probably happen
mostly on services
running on ports 0 &lt; 1024, because only a root process can bind to those ports.
Therefore, an email server running on port 25 will most likely be
running as root.
selinux niche is probably to protect and isolate servers running under
the root account.
But the reference policy has policies for nearly everything even such
programs as tvtime.

It may be a matter of opinion whether setting up selinux policies is easier
or whether writing an init script to run a daemon as non root user
within a chroot is easier.
Since bind's named is a frequent target for attack
the bind spell in the grimoire
already makes use of named's command line parameters
to execute the server using a non root account within a chroot jail.
However, not all servers are that easy to run that way.
Yet typically merely running a server with a non root account
is enough to limit the potential access a successful attack can gain.

Although xinetd is inefficient.
It does provide a method for limiting access and to a server,
not unlike using iptables,
but also to enable the server to start as a non root user.
xinetd runs as root so it can bind to ports 0 &gt; 1024,
however the program xinetd invokes does not have to be run as root.

Lastly, some services which do not have to be run as root can be run
on higher ports such as a webserver on port 8080.
It is possible for firewalls to translate not only addresses but also ports
so that a server running on port 8080 on the host box appears to be accessible
on port 80 from boxes contacting the firewall from the outside.
Also by using iptables port forwarding can be configured on the same box.

Consequently, a securely configured box is not necessarily more secure
when it is configured with selinux, grsecurity, rsbac, etc...
However, it could be.
Most importantly, the effectiveness of security is the sum of the
knowledge and effort from the SA.

rsbac and grsecurity still exist in the grimoire for those who want to try them.
They are similar to selinux, but less complicated.
Just as there at least 6 different ways to do encryption on a linux box
there are at least 6 different ways to do enhanced security.
app-armor, I merely know by name, apparently is something like
grsecurity/selinux.

Deciding between old coke, new coke, coke 0, coke without caffeine, diet coke
is far easier than deciding between grsecurity, rsbac, and selinux.
I hate coke.
None for me thanks.

I know some SAs will feel that way about selinux.
You can pry it off using augur exile if you want,
but it will not hurt to leave installed and add the
kernel parameter to lilo.conf.head and lilo.conf
to disable selinux during boot.

Lastly, there may be some optimization mistakes on the 20080501 i586 I/R
An unknown ( 60+ ) amount of installed spells may be optimized to run
on athlon-xp hardware.
They might not run on i586 or error with an invalid instruction.
Oops.
Naturally, I am doing a complete recompilation of the i586 I/R
About 150 spells remain to compile.
Therefore, it may not be ready next week.
However, it may be possible to use the 20080501 i586 I/R for installation
on i686 and i586 architecture inspite of the mistake and
then do a rebuild afterward.
Good luck.
