</I>There are two different technologies: (1) flash memory sticks with ~100,000 
writes, and (2) the SSD (solid-state disks) with &gt;1e6 writes. Furthermore, 
some devices (SSDs, but not sure if all of them; I am pretty sure flash 
memories do not have this) employ wear leveling alghorithms to avoid writing 
to the same memory cells all the time.

&gt;<i> Although USB memory sticks are filesystem independent
</I>&gt;<i> and we can use ext2 or luks encrypted ext3 on them
</I>&gt;<i> or whatever we want the probability is that distributions
</I>&gt;<i> that are designed to be booted from USB stick do not
</I>&gt;<i> run from the USB stick.
</I>&gt;<i> They are probably designed to be loaded entirely into RAM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, with the benefit of ext3 and a commit value
</I>&gt;<i> as high as one month then all writes, yes even syslog,
</I>&gt;<i> can be delayed until a sync command is issued
</I>Such high commit values are not necessary. Take for example a 32GB flash 
memory with expectancy of 100,000 writes. If you were to continuosly write to 
this stick at 10MB/s, it would take 3.2e10^8 seconds (~10.1 years) to kill 
it. This is however assuming that the entire memory is used (and killed). The 
life time of the card would obviously shorten if the writes were performed to 
a limited range of memory cells or with faster write speeds. So for a common 
desktop use, I would not worry about killing it at all (in a reasonable time 
frame). 

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for selecting any 32G USB stick at random?
</I>Some of the flash cards (and SSDs?) are slow because they do not use DMA or 
only older (and slower) modes. Unfortunately, this information is very 
difficult to get unless buying some pricey memories (several hundreds dollars 
and up). 

&gt;<i> Probably not a good bet.
</I>&gt;<i> Some may be faster.
</I>&gt;<i> Some may re-write more.
</I>&gt;<i> Some may be difficult to insert into the USB port.
</I>
