<PRE>re: fb.modes - I dunno that they can be generated?
<A HREF="http://bisqwit.iki.fi/source/fbmodes.html">http://bisqwit.iki.fi/source/fbmodes.html</A>

hrm... something to play with I guess..

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a system configuration sense yes -  I'd like a nice right click in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the desktop manager - display properties, advanced...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It surprises me that compared to other operating systems GUI
</I>&gt;<i> that X can not change color depth while running.
</I>&gt;<i> Or is the problem that I never learned how?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Definatly - I know that a redhat box has utilities for reconfiguring
X's resolution...on the fly without restart?
and the nvidia-settings application can do it ( though that is a
specific target)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do no longer recall the name of the utility that does that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nvidia-settings
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

&gt;<i> Now I forgot the question.
</I>&gt;<i> But I did not have that answer in mind
</I>&gt;<i> since it requires the pre-compiled binary drivers from nvidia.
</I>&gt;<i> Wish I had not thought about it.
</I>&gt;<i> The capacitors on my nvidia card exploded last week.
</I>&gt;<i> However, having bought it from a decent computer store
</I>&gt;<i> they handled the RMA for me since I bought it in January.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps what nvidia cards require most is some sort of physical
</I>&gt;<i> barrier that can be installed between the card and the capacitors
</I>&gt;<i> so that when it detonates it does not also destroy adjacent hardware?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did wonder why how when I switched over to a S3virge PCI graphics
</I>&gt;<i> card and enabled MTRR for it's memory range that typing gmail email
</I>&gt;<i> in firefox was so slow?
</I>&gt;<i> I could easily type many characters if not lines ahead of what was displayed.
</I>&gt;<i> Even 300 baud mode connections were faster than that.
</I>&gt;<i> But I was surprised that the graphics card had a performance impact
</I>&gt;<i> with a task that does not seem that it should be graphic intensive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yeah - but in a bare box... it's a good point of capaiblity - I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thought it was just vmware that was giving me like 1600x1200 screen...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1920x1600 ? (yeah I guess my laptop is really only 1920x1200 so... I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> guess it's best fit width)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1920x1200 on a notebook?
</I>&gt;<i> Impressive resolution.
</I>&gt;<i> But pixiels would be more tiny than I can see.
</I>
Actually you'd be surprized - deffault X xterm's are using their
common single-pixel font and it's way readable :)

&gt;<i> I would still rather have 2048x768 spread out over two old 17&quot; monitors.
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder how long before notebooks support dual monitor configurations,
</I>&gt;<i> while not counting the notebook display as a monitor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Some already do have 2 outputs a VGA and a DVI out..

&gt;<i> You made good points.
</I>&gt;<i> xorg is nearly to the point where it can be launched without
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/X11/xorg.conf and be nearly as usable as it would be with
</I>&gt;<i> a more precise configuration file.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps in a year or two it will become better?
</I>
I would think so... it's definatly evolved
