<PRE>Since I improved the ELF checking and added LA checking
I for a moment began considering the md5sum checking.

Currently, md5sum checks can be done weekly using the sorcery-md5sum check.
It checks all installed spells.
It is a good check.
But it is also heavy on disk access.

Instead I was thinking about a new feature.

What about a md5sum check that does merely one spell at a time?
Perhaps it begins with the oldest installed spell.
It checks the md5sum files and then updates the time-stamp on
that spells md5sum log in /etc/sorcery/log/md5sum/

But when is the best time to perform the check?
Perhaps the check should be done currently during dispel?
That way every time a spell dispels,
such as during updates of installed spells,
a md5sum check is performed on an installed spell.

This may be good place for it because dispel is heavy on CPU and light
on disk usage,
while a md5sum check is heavy on disk usage but light on CPU usage.

I have not yet made a table weighing the boons and banes.
Would anyone like to use this feature if implemented?
Does it have more benefits or more costs over doing
a weekly md5sum check of all installed spells?

Considerations:

While initially it seems like a good idea there is no correlation between
how long a spell is installed and the probability of files corrupting.
Also files accessed more frequently may have a higher probability
of being corrupt than files that are rarely accessed.

If a box has 1000 installed spells, with an average of 200 updating monthly
5 months may be required to md5sum check files for all installed spells.
Therefore, a corrupt file could exist for 5 months before detection
as opposed to merely one week.


Given the above considerations I will probably abandon this feature idea
unless someone can make a strong case for it's potential benefits.


Other variations: md5sum check during augur scry.
