<PRE>As usual I make no guarantee about the merge order of spells.

The beta or developmental gpm sources are a bit flaky.
They might not compile or they might not run correctly.
I decided to wait out the problems because
it is unlikely for sorcerer SAs to be using gpm in order
to copy and paste at the console.
However, I am aware that there are some Sorcerer SAs
that are using the Linux frame buffer.
While it provides a nice alternative to X
it lacks the convenience of a window manager.
linux-fusion helps provide that.

Last time I checked I recall that the developmental versions
of DirectFB are a better choice for use than stable.
However, for reasons I forgot we are still
using the stable versions of DirectFB and linux-fusion.
If anyone is using the dev versions and wants to provide
information then please do.
It may have been that the developmental versions caused
some other programs to not compile that would otherwise
support DirectFB stable versions.

Lastly, most spells are hard-coded to support only X
where obviously DirectFB can be used instead.
gtk+ and SDL are that way.

For embedded use DirectFB is viable,
but still most software that can require X libraries
do require X libraries.

I bring this up because I expect a SA that uses virtual
consoles often might also use DirectFB.
X does not require gpm.
Also X supports more input
devices and protocols than gpm.
It is possible to use the mouse using gpm from the console
and also have it work in X by using gpm's repeater device.
However, I do not know if anyone does that unless
the distribution automatically sets it up that way.

I will test the latest available version of gpm.
If it does not work please continue using 1.99.3
According to:

<A HREF="http://linux.schottelius.org/gpm/archives/">http://linux.schottelius.org/gpm/archives/</A>

it is still available for download.
