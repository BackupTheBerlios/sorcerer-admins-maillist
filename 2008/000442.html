<PRE>&gt;<i> Yes, but some of network can start in S an some in 3, 4... etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> which implies multiple (more than 1 ) run level for setting up and
</I>&gt;<i> getting networking going.
</I>
Perhaps I should have phrased it differently?
Networking starts during sysinit.
In runlevels 0 1 6 networking is shut down?

I admit that I also find it confusing that sysinit
and runlevels 0 and 6 are not runlevels.
However, an easy way to think about it is that
at runlevels 1 2 3 4 5 a box will continue to in those levels.
sysinit 0 and 6 are transitional.

sysinit symbolic links are placed in /etc/rc.d/rcS.d
That does not make it a runlevel.
There is nothing special to it.
It merely follows a tradition.
Setting up a distro that boots without sysinit is possible.
However, sysinit serves an additional useful purpose on Sorcerer.
sysinit executes from the initramfs when booting with initramfs.
The successful execution of sysinit ends by starting the real init
which executes on the real root filesystem
and enters into runlevels 1 2 3 4 5

I expect some distros have something different that
executes on the initramfs or initrd instead of sysinit.
However, I have not compared Sorcerer's boot with
any other distros.
Seems to work a-okay as is and having sysinit execute
from initramfs saves SAs from having to learn about
something entirely differently that handles booting
from initramfs.
Therefore, I consider it added functionality
without added complexity.


&gt;<i> Okay whatever, technicality.... yes standards indicate this is true...
</I>&gt;<i> and all I'd have to do is change the default in inttab to 5 from 3...
</I>&gt;<i> not an issue.
</I>
It is still possible to elect to not have a GUI login execute
on runlevel 5 merely by selecting those init-scripts,
xdm gdm kdm-v3 kdm-v4, to not execute automatically
during startup and shutdown.
Aside from that runlevels 3 and 5 are nearly identical.
Runelvels 2 and 4 are nearly identical.

Sorcerer flexibility in how init-scripts are installed
might in some ways obsolete the necessity of
having so many runlevel choices.
But until now I had no reason to think about it.


&gt;<i> Again, XDM does not have an option to auto login. I do not WANT gdm or
</I>&gt;<i> kdm - as I do not need all their additional bloat of gnome or kde
</I>&gt;<i> libraries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and yes - option to start networking in S level would have fixed my
</I>&gt;<i> issue also (which was what I was originaly going to do)
</I>
Did you take a good look at those scripts xdm installs?
I would not wager that xdm can not be configured for kiosk use.
And it is considerably light weight compared to kdm and gdm.

But you would not require xdm for something so simple.
Merely creating a login environment, starting X, and having
it execute a window manager should work.

Let us see something like....

#!/bin/bash

start(){
 while : ; do /bin/su - guest -c startx; done &amp;
 sleep 0.1
 echo &quot;$!&quot; &gt; /var/run/xguest
}

And put the WM and other commands to run in
~/guest/.xinitrc

exec the window manager last
Have the programs begin before it backgrounded.
The example in startx gives an excellent example.


&gt;<i> There is no auto restart when running startx.
</I>&gt;<i> when X exits, it exits.
</I>
You could loop the window manager in ~/.xinitrc
But if the user zaps the X server or it crashes
then it is gone.
Using a wrapper script like the one I wrote as
an example above can continually restart the
X server as guest and with the PID saved
it can be killed when no longer wanted.
Do not forget the sleep.
BASH can not grant PIDs for recently backgrounded processes.
An wait of an undetermined amount of time is required
before using $!


&gt;<i> There is NO auto login option for xdm.
</I>
Option? What option? I meant edit the scripts in
/etc/X11/xdm/ in order to make it do a kiosk login.
But a wrapper script around startx is probably easier.


&gt;<i> that's pretty much my point... I would rather that my startx was
</I>&gt;<i> maintained by inittab.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> but a really stupid simple script works...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --- watch_task --
</I>&gt;<i> #!/bin/bash
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> $*
</I>&gt;<i> echo $(date) restarting $* &gt;&gt;/tmp/watch_task.log
</I>&gt;<i> $0 $* &amp;
</I>
That is simple?
I have no clue what it does.

Some of the servers installed by
sorcery-immune sorcery-bgz demonstrate
how a BASH script can be made into a daemon.
Technically, leech and cast are also daemons
or something similar since they execute in the background.
Of course, they are not started at boot.


&gt;<i> Not really an issue, but it is a custom hack rather than a standard
</I>&gt;<i> utility to restart a task.
</I>
That circles around to one of my original questions.
Should something that provides this functionality be
provided in init-functions?
First, I am not certain that with only one example of
what want it to do that we can make it into a standard.
In order to standardize mounting of virtual filesystems
there were more than 5 places where virtual filesystems
would be mounted and all those scripts worked out to
do almost entirely the same thing.
Therefore, it was much like recognizing it as a macro
and then defining that macro in init-functions.

However, with only one example of what we want looped
that does not provide enough of an idea of how it should
be made standard.
Therefore, you seem to be on track with writing a custom
init-script to handle that specific case.

I apologize if I appeared to push xdm gdm and kdm a bit much.
I agree startx is a simple and adequate solution when
proceeded by su - guest in order to first switch to a non
root account.

Hmm.... but now I do have a bit of an itch from this discussion.
Should a spell be created that requires startx that
will create a guest user and group when cast and will
provide automatic kisok login for user guest?
Of course what programs are started and what window
manager are started would depend upon
~/guest/.xinitrc
A default one could be provided similar to the example
that is given in startx that executes twm,
the window manager, for the window manager.

That seems like a good idea.
I will go ahead and do that.
However, I will consider the name of the spell
and account name and other details a little longer
before I write the spell.
I am considering putting an account and group of guest
in the 512 to 1023 range because it is a role account
rather than a service account ( 256 =&gt; 512 ) and not a
user account ( 1024 &gt;= 65534 )

Anything else you want with it?
Banana peppers, jalapeno peppers, green and red peppers?
I am in the mood for a sub sandwich.

I suppose I will call it xguest.
That seems to be available and it seems a decently
enough descriptive name without being verbose.
Besides it took me way to long to learn how to spell kiosk.

I suppose if anyone has a need for a similar spell that
uses a different account name than guest
then they will probably want to further customize it
than merely adjust the name and will write it into their
local grimoire as a custom spell.
At least having the example spell will ease the task
for SAs that have not set up a kiosk style auto-login.

I will copy this into my todo file.
