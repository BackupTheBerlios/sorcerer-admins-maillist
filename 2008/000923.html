The none of the chrooted casting worked then?
That is a bit of a problem.
Yet it will have to wait until I roll the next I/Rs

&gt;&gt;<i> If a SA does not do the compilation step as part of the installation

</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, i think i did try to chroot to /media/root/ but it did not worked.
</I>&gt;<i> So perhaps transfer is to blame?
</I>
Well if transferring did not work then chroot building would not work,
however there would also probably be nothing installed.
How did you make it work with nothing installed?
Did you do a manual installation?


&gt;<i> &gt; Was it possible that some important step was skipped?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well i did go thru all steps, so i dont think so.
</I>
That is good.
In many cases the installer will not allow progress to the next step
until required steps are complete.


&gt;&gt;<i> Or does the target disk have an old lilo in the MBR and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the new lilo in a partition boot block?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Complete blank disk, not even partition exists.
</I>
Then it also requires a bootable MBR installed.
ms-sys will do that.
It is available from the installer.
However, it can also be run from the command line.

&gt;&gt;<i> I might also add in that certain filesystems are unsuitable for use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for installing lilo into the boot block of the partition because the file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system will not automatically reserve that space.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I tend to use only ext2 and ext3
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also usually make first partition as /boot, using ext3, in this case also.
</I>
Then almost without question lilo would install to the boot block of /boot
/boot should normally be ext2 because a journal would waste space
on a small partition.
However, now we do tend to use larger /boot partitions.

&gt;&gt;<i> Another possible solution is to try installing from older I/Rs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Newer is usually better, but older are still available for download.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Will try.
</I>
Thanks.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Evert gave me extensive input for what he wants to see in the next
menu driven I/R installer.
Consequently, I have to do full testing on it anyway.
It is nearly a one menu design.
It feels a bit overwhelming to me,
but we shall see if it works or not.
Evert did not like the idea of having to leave the disk menu
with partitions mounted in order to goto the compile menu.
It was perhaps counter intuitive?

Also Evert had a great idea for a menu while booting
from the I/R that would make the I/R
be more useful for recovering deployed.
The improvements for the next I/R should be interesting to see.

I am looking forward to it.
I miss the days when I had enough CPU power to grind out I/Rs
one day after the next if a bad mistake was made.
But there was no x86_64 port back then.
