<PRE>I may be the only person who uses augur history?
It is still available.
It was a good idea, but perhaps too simple in the implementation.
It was slow and required plenty of disk space.
It used to be in /etc/sorcery/log/history/
It is now safe to remove /etc/sorcery/log/history/

History is now kept in /etc/sorcery/log/history.gz
Requires less disk space and is faster to search.
Likewise snapshot logs used to be made in /etc/sorcery/log/snappy/
Or maybe it was named something else?
However, it is now stored like history is.
It is now /etc/sorcery/log/snap.gz
It is now quicker to search and it uses less disk space.

/etc/sorcery/log/snap/ is remaining as it is.
Although it is not used by the sorcery tools
it is useful to examine to discover what was
installed the last time a certain spell cast.
It is most useful when trying to discovery why
software that used to compile no longer compiles
and the error message dose not provide a good clue.


/etc/sorcery/log/{snappy,history}  can be removed.
They will not be automatically removed by sorcery
which is why I am sending out this email.

If I did remove them automatically someone might complain.
Afterall, they may have been building up for months or years
and provide some sort of useful information.
The old logs that are no longer used will not be converted over to the
new style.
While they could be converted it is not essential because these logs
are for SAs only
and are not used directly by the sorcery tools.

As usual all other changes are transparent
and most often involve optimizing the sorcery tools performance.
However, please report bugs as you find them.
Jan discovered and reported
an incredibly long lived bug involving &quot;always on&quot; and &quot;always off&quot;.
Thanks to Jan it is now fixed.

Lastly unless someone has a fix for ati-driver-installer
then it is currently broken.
Hope everyone's installed ati-driver-installer keeps working
or it's back to the xorg drivers for those cards.
The NVIDIA-Linux-x86 spell is fixed and working with the latest linux.
To avoid bewilderment the NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64 spell does not exist.
The NVIDIA-Linux-x86 spell downloads and installs
the correct pre-compiled binaries based upon the $HOSTTYPE

Good luck with your updates.

</PRE>
