Jan has some very good ideas for improving repository support
and might have a prototype in testing.
He was suggesting that entire repositories be kept in
/var/cache/sources/repo/$SOME/$THING
and that tarballs can be rolled from the repository and places in
/var/cache/sources/$SPELL/$VERSION
By that fashion sorcery would still be tarball based
however it would also be able to update repositories stored locally
in /var/cache/sources/repo/ instead of downloading it new each time.
He also had some ideas for supporting download by rsync.
I also am interested in seeing how it turns out.

</I>&gt;<i> I happily volunteer some time spent compiling all the sources I have

Well, like I said these are only potential plans.
Plan B that tries to promote latest VP, version progress,
to stable VP on a monthly basis is ambitious.

However Plan C that allow for latest VP grants as much time as required
before promoting a latest VP to a stable VP.

One of the things that might be useful is to try to hold the newer stable
releases of libraries in the latest VP until the software projects that use
those libraries are also updated.
For example...
I only update qt-x11-opensource stable VP not when a new qt-x11-opensource
becomes available, but when a new kde-v4 becomes available.
That way I can test the qt-x11-opensource compile and kde-v4 compile together.
I do the same for qt-x11-free and kde-v3

Likewise video codec libraries could be paired with video
players/editor programs.

The alternative is something that I used to have AI-grimoire-guru do.
That is to compile and update then recompile everything that
aron the updated spell.
But that can create massive lists of spells for compilation.
I forgot how long is required to generate a list from an augur aron request.
It is still massive.

Anyway my point is that some spells aught to be paired together when possible
for updates in order to gain greater assurance that compilation will
be successful.
However, that said the grimoire is a web of requirements
that would make any spider proud.
That is why gaining complete assurance that updates will not break
the compilation of other spells is difficult to accomplish.

&gt;<i> Also, my life cycle does not quite permit a monthly ... anything, really. I
</I>&gt;<i> spend five weeks on board a ship, and the laptop that I run Sorcerer on is
</I>&gt;<i> running incredibly light in the spell division, with only about 500 spells
</I>&gt;<i> installed. I have not installed anything but KDE4. Anything that requires
</I>&gt;<i> KDE3 libs is simply not installed and I try to manage without it. Then I go
</I>&gt;<i> home and might only have a few weeks there, but a much more powerful machine
</I>&gt;<i> and many, many more spells installed.
</I>
That is an excellent point that a monthly plan for promoting newly released
software from latest to stable is an inflexible plan that is
inconveniences people.
That said plan B is looking like it will not be used.
