<PRE>Since given a few lines of code here or there
sorcery can do nearly anything a SA can dream
we are already at a point where augur
has too many commands and is growing.
# augur | wc -l
153
Terse help alone is 153 lines of reading.
That is why I am taking a few short cuts here
and there to help keep the functionality high
and the confusion low.

In this latest sorcery release I added the summary
of event activity as Evert requested.
# augur event 30
That, for example, will print a 30 day event summary
along with a listing of the events.
It is not entirely accurate since only the most recent
events for a spell will be printed.
If gtk+ was cast twice during that period then the list
will only print the most recent time that it was cast.
But generally that aught to be good enough for giving
SAs and idea of the flow of events.
Full history, of course, is available in the event logs.
I just used a sloppy and fast way to extra and order
event history since the time written inside of event files
is probably subject to locale settings and therefore
very difficult to parse and order using a program.

Also I replaced

# augur index

with a method for accessing the index, instead of generating it.

# augur help index

Explains how it works.

I still have plenty on my todo list.
My apology goes out to the people waiting for me to get something done.

The latest sorcery also supports the new progress of latest.
Only a few spells have latest in them.
Like I said before how this will work is only half decided.
However, having the new functionality
as an extension of version progress makes sense.

I hope those who do it already finished their holiday shopping.
It may be a bit soon, but otherwise I will probably forget to mention it.
So I hope everyone has a great holiday and successful new year.
