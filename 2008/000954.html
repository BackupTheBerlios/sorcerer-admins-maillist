<PRE>Thanks for the HowTos.
However, depending on one's taste it may simply be easier
just to specify the desired modes in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
It may be almost inescapable if using NVIDIA-* with dual monitors
since there must be some way to specify position and whether
the desktop is duplicated or extended across both monitors.

What I dislike is having a virtual screen display larger than the
monitor resolution.
Even if I use kdm's control panel to switch to lower resolutions
I end up with a large virtual display than physical display.
Wait, that is called virtual in xorg.conf, right?

I have a vague recollection of starting an X server without
an xorg.conf at sometime and ending up with 1280x1024 resolution.
More resolution is nice, but it does not look as good on my monitors.
I prefer the higher refresh less flickering and so forth.
Yes I still use CRTs on all of my computers and not LCDs.

Thanks again for the URLs.
I agree that it is good that there is more than one way to configure X.
For example pointer buttons can be assigned or re-assigned using
/etc/X11/xorg.conf or it can be done from one's own ~/.xsession
by invoking xmodmap
It provides a good compromise for giving both SAs and users
the X(perience) that they desire.  *chuckle*  Yes, a little pun intended.

Oh, it may be worth noting that if someone has an old enough monitor
there is the potential that starting X without specifying an maximum mode
may cause the monitor to pop, break, or otherwise damage.
Although it was not due X
I did somehow wreck a monitor more than a decade ago.
Fortunately, it was still under warranty.

Anyway, if the monitor is a CRT I always specify in
/etc/X11/xorg.conf the horizontal frequency range
and vertical frequency range.
It is usually either printed in the monitor manual book
or on a sticker on the back of a monitor.
I doubt anyone still does that since I am likely the
last person in the USA still using CRTs and loving them.
When one blows I buy another nice big 17&quot; incher
for $10 at nearby thrift stores.
Yes, I really do that.

I wish I could collect old computer parts bulk and cheap.
That way I could build hundreds of Sorcerer boxes and
put them in useful places like schools and churches, etc...

I saw the middle school classroom that my sister taught at.
There was just one computer in it and it had a really big monitor.
It looked somewhat expensive.
But that is so inefficient.
There aught to be a computer on every desktop even
if they are all original pentium mmx and 14 inch monitors.
It is not as if that stuff would be worth very much $$
if I could get my hands on it.

Oh well it will not matter soon.
cellphone are nearly all the computer anyone needs these days.
Might not be long before notebooks are as cheap and common
place as solar powered calculators.
That should be fun, yes?
Sort of makes me wonder what fun life would be like
to be born yesterday or even a decade from now.

Really, I do not see how school with paper books and
almost no computer time competes to hold the interest
of students that have xbox-360 and nice workstation or notebook at home?
School was boring enough when I went.
I could never do it again.
And I do not even own an xbox-360.
I would still rather read manual pages and use
and dictionary on computer
than actually flip pages in a paper book.
Ah, sorry I digressed.
I do that sometimes.  :)
