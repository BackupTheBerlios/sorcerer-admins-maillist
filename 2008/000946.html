</I>&gt;<i> According to your next email it broke in a way that I did not expect.
</I>&gt;<i> Compile errors are not supposed to happen during installation.
</I>
There are just so many different PC compatible hardware systems that you 
can't possible to anticipate all bugs in hardware or in software.
Like if compiler is buggy or kernel or its driver is buggy and that bug 
comes in life during installer, IMHO it does not hurt to have atleast some 
level of error checking instead some blind belive it cant possible to have 
any errors. 

&gt;<i> &gt; My point was that there are lot's of SSH scanners, i mean lots of 
</I>them, who
&gt;<i> &gt; does scan port 22 and tries to login with some accounts and passwords,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thousands and thoudands times in a day.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose not having the port answer saves a little bandwidth.
</I>&gt;<i> But still finding a ssh2 port is far from impossible.
</I>
It does not make SSG port secret, but then about million SSH scanner bots 
do not find it and try to break in.

&gt;<i> logging may be useful also to detect attack vectors.
</I>
Logging is kinda pointles unless you are some security company who is 
collecting botnet information, 
you just get million IP-addresses who belong to some botnet. 

&gt;<i> If someone really wants to crack their way into a network
</I>
Putting SSH do other port than 22 does not help in that case but it helps 
to prevent botnets trying to break in on easy way.

What would you use to prevent those pesky scanners to poke my ssh ports? I 
mean they come in millions so whats the point logging them unless you are 
doing some police work to shutdown botnets, etc. scanner machines are just 
zombies so it does not help to shutdown one captures bot machine if there 
are million more.
