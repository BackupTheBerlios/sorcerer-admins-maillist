Right on about mcron!
Thanks for finding and reporting the problem with it.

</I>&gt;<i> Am I right ? Needing internet access to build seems like a very

</I>
gtk-doc has been a problem in the past.
Some versions of it would not compile.
In most cases gtk-doc is an optional requirement for compilation.
Several spells have gtk-doc off or optional.
However pygtk recently made gtk-doc a mandatory requirement
in order for pygtk to compile and install.
Is that the spell at the base of the gtk-doc problem?

docbook, hmmm?
Fix the spell if you can, please.
Although I wrote it, I did so in a rather odd fashion.
Much to my surprise nowhere
could I find documentation on how to install docbook.
However, one tarball or zipfile did have something like
an install script so I attempted to mimic what it did for
different versions of docbook XML and XSL so that they
could be installed and have their catalogs correctly adjusted.

Much time has elapsed since I wrote the spell.
It probably works as good as it ever did.
And in several cases it does work.
But perhaps not all.
Sometimes it is just a matter of having the correct
version of XML or XSL sheets installed.
Unfortunately, source trees never specify
in the README or INSTALL files
what versions of docbook XML or XSL is required.


&gt;<i> I've rebuilt it all yesterday, didn't fix the problem (but did
</I>&gt;<i> make me spot the cron bug).
</I>&gt;<i> I tried recasting docbooc, various docbook-* spells, etc, to no
</I>&gt;<i> avail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any pointers greatly appreciated.
</I>
I feel the same way about docbook.
I can try to check and revise the spell in a few days,
but it might not perform any better than it does already.
And I agree that docbook is problematic in that it some sources
try to download pages files from the Internet during compilation.
It should just throw errors and specify what it requires where.
The absurd complexity of docbook makes
it a big step down from plain ASCII.

I recently wrote a spell for docbook2X.
The spell is probably proper.
However, docbook2X does not install any of the XML or XSL it requires.
Consequently, docbook2man does not work properly.
Consequently, module-init-tools 3.4 fails compilation
because it requires docbook2man.

If you get a chance to fix docbook* gtk-doc
then maybe try fixing docbook2X also, please?

Thanks again for reporting the mcron problem.
The fix will is in time for the girmoire that will go out
6 hours from now.
