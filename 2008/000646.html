<PRE>A half terabyte USB external disk I saw a while back for $250.
But it also has banes:
high power consumption,
being separate from notebook = greater potential for damage,
fixed disk = potential for errors and crashes.
If a notebook already has an internal fixed disk
then the only reason for a USB external disk
would be for backups or additional storage.

For being external it has additional banes
and the only additional boon is that it does
not produce heat inside the notebook.
Considering the size of an external USB disk
it does not seem as convenient a solution
as USB memory sticks for the sharing of notebooks.
Also while the ratio of GB to price is good
a user might not have need for half a terabyte.
32G or 64G might be enough for both
operating system and home files.

Overall comparing USB memory sticks to USB disks
is not unlike comparing apples to pineapples.
They both contain the word apple that might
mislead some to think that they are the same.
However, upon closer inspection they are very different.

As to the question of the urban legend of 100,000 to 1,000,000
writes before a USB memory stick begins to fail?
I do not know.
I read somewhere that rewriteable CDROMs should be good
for at least 100,000 writes.
I am lucky if they write perfectly the first time.
With CDROMs I tend to write once, read once, chuck it in the trash can.

Obviously USB memory sticks are
faster and more reliable than CDROM.
But I have not encountered reliable data
where people have tested USB sticks until
the point of failure in order to determine
the extent of their re-writeability.
However, I expect with the long history of
such old technology that it still has a limited lifespan.
This goes back all the way to the days when we
would burn ROMs in EPROM burners.
Back then it was write once and forever
so be sure the code is perfect.

When the rewriteable static memory technology is perfected
then we will probably be able to buy boxes without battery
powered CMOS RAM.
But then again a battery might still be required for keeping time.

Ah, sorry I am digressing.
I expect that the technology of USB memory sticks
still has a limited lifespan.
If lithium ion batteries were put on those
then they could be just like system RAM
and be both fast and infinitely re-writeable.
But since the main use of USB memory sticks
is for music players, cameras, video cameras,
and file transport the limited lifespan design
is accepted by consumers and desired by manufacturers.
Yet they are not best for replacing a fixed disk
as we would want to use them for that purpose.

Although USB memory sticks are filesystem independent
and we can use ext2 or luks encrypted ext3 on them
or whatever we want the probability is that distributions
that are designed to be booted from USB stick do not
run from the USB stick.
They are probably designed to be loaded entirely into RAM.

However, with the benefit of ext3 and a commit value
as high as one month then all writes, yes even syslog,
can be delayed until a sync command is issued
assuming sufficient RAM is available to cache.
As such that might reduce the amount of writes
during uptime to under 100 per boot?
If cast also omits issuing sync commands
then updating the operating system will also
create less writes to the USB stick.
For this reason I expect that an expected
operational duration of 2 years is possible
with Sorcerer on USB stick
if the tools are properly relaxed
to reduce the amount of sync executed.

As for selecting any 32G USB stick at random?
Probably not a good bet.
Some may be faster.
Some may re-write more.
Some may be difficult to insert into the USB port.

I have a USB memory stick that is slim,
but very difficult to insert into a USB port.
The design is compact, but I must keep pressure
on a slide to keep it from enclosing it's USB connector
when attempting to attach it.
That makes it impossible to attach
while other USB devices are attached.
Very annoying for me, but might not be a problem for most people?
