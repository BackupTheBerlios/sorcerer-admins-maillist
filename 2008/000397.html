<PRE>&gt;<i> Another problem with shishisd initscript, /etc/init.d/shishid, it just hangs
</I>&gt;<i> out and wont go over it, meaning if you reboot your machine, it waits
</I>&gt;<i> forever shishisd to start up, not good.
</I>
Thanks for reporting it.
I would expect shishid
to automatically background itself.
Apparently, it does not.
Now the init-script will background it.

This type of hang is rare,
Init-scripts are normally written properly.
In this case it is serious enough
to block the startup of sshd.
Therefore, it would require a local login
to find and fix the problem.

This impels consideration
if this type of hang can be handled by
and/or circumvented by improving the
init-system.
Unfortunately, bash is too buggy to handle it.

First, when a background process is started
a short but unspecified delay is explicitly
required in order to be able to acquire the
PID of the most recently started background process.
Secondly, after issuing the bash wait command
the bash script will wait forever rather than
allow a timeout.
Third, the exit status of a program started in
the background is not available.

Therefore, the best solution will still be to report
buggy init-scripts so that they can be fixed.
Thanks for the report.

shishid should only run on the kerberos 5
server and backup servers that are issuing tickets.
Unless using kerberos 5 for network wide
authentication
then shishid should probably not be started during boot.
Although kerberos 5 support and libraries are
required for several sources shishid need only
be run on if boxes are configured for
network wide authentication.

The grimoire offers several different choices
for authentication:

If the 3 headed hell hound has you down
you can try padl_ldap for PAM support with
credentials stored centrally in an LDAP server.
While not overly easy to set up
the spells do save time and effort.

For petting the pooch,
the grimoire supports 2 different breeds:
shishi, for a 3-headed gnu.
heimdal, for a Sweedish implementation

To leash them to Linux-PAM try pam_krb5
Note that this will require customized files
in /etc/pam.d so that programs will indeed
authenticate with kerberos 5 rather than
using Linux-PAM as a bridge to shadow
passwords.

For another type of authentication try freeradius.
However, I know of no Sorcerer boxes using it.

Sorcerer, comes with shadow passwords enabled
by default for local authentication.
However, for those who require it,
or the masochists that love the brutal punishment
that comes with the slightest misconfiguration,
there is Linux-PAM which provides a
widely supported API for accessing
authentication methods.
PAM provides a layer between programs
and authentication methods so that an
application programmer must only implement
PAM support in order for several different
authentication methods to be used.
The concept of PAM is originally
a contribution by Sun Microsystems.

Likewise Sun Microsystems designed
NIS and NIS+ which can also be used for
storing user account information,
group information, IP address to name mappings,
and other sorts of information.
NIS support is complete for linux.
However, interest in NIS+ has long since died.
Use of NIS may be somewhat rare except in
networks that also have Solaris boxes on it.

For all authentication methods that do not
plug into PAM
then the configuration usually involve
modifying /etc/nsswitch.conf
kerberos 5 is sufficiently acknowledge
for use enterprise authentication that
many programs support the use of
kerberos 5 natively without having to
use Linux-PAM as a layer.
However, it is possible to use kerberos 5
both directly and through Linux-PAM
concurrently on a box in order to provide
a uniform authentication method for all
the installed programs.

For those SAs who were reading along and
wondering, what is shishid for and what is shishi?
Now you have the answer.
It is one of the different authentication methods
that are supported in the Sorcerer grimoire.

A few years back Sorcerer did support the
MIT kerberos 5 implementation.
However, they made it excessively difficult
to download the source code, with leech.
Therefore, it was dropped from the grimoire.
Chances are you will never require that specific
implementation of kerberos 5.
But if you do and want it supported in the grimoire
then you must send us the spells and init-scripts.
