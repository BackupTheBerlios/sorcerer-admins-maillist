Keeping a separate and updated installation of Sorcerer in a subdirectory
is a fine method for running ia32 pre-compiled binaries.

they are now broke on x86_64


If every software author provided support for x86_64 so that when compiled
on that architecture it installs libraries in lib64 directories then maybe the
idea might have some merit.
However, as it is now it is half-***ed

Even if I tried to force lib64 directory installation by moving stuff,
I would encounter numerous problems like the time I tried that before.
Numerous libtool pkgconfig problems would occur.
Segregating pkgconfig into /usr/lib64/pkgconfig/ and /usr/lib/pkgconfig/
would not be difficult.
However, insuring the correct .la file is used whether it be from /usr/lib/
/usr/lib64/ maybe very challenging.
Can not have the .la for the ELF32 libraries being used when compiling ELF64,
nor vice versa.

And even if I surmounted those problems there would be even more
very significant problems if trying to compile IA32 ELFs using a multilib gcc.
Installation could be considerable problematic if ELF32 executables are
run with an ELF64 sentinel preloaded library.
And x86_64 architecture would be larger since
I would have to make every source that installs libraries to compile
twice to create both ELF64 and ELF32 libraries.

While not impossible, I would probably require an actual x86_64 box
if I want to complete the task within my lifetime.

And the result would probably of sufficient complexity that
spell authorship would be beyond the capabilities of most SAs,
because they would have to be able to write spells that work on
both x86_64 and ia32 architecture and carefully read all Makefiles
to ensure that ELF32 executables are not being installed over ELF64.

Take the update of make, for example.
What if an ELF32 make is installed over the ELF64 make?
No problem, right?
However, the next time make is invoked during the second half
of compiling make, make fails to run?
Why?
The sentinel library preloaded is ELF64 and the make being run is ELF32.
Same goes for binutils, coreutils, gcc, glibc, and plenty of other spells.

Separate installations of Sorcerer x86_64 and ia32 are eloquent.
Attempting to merge and maintain it
in the same root filesystem
is like a conjoined twin.

Now, you can graft an IA32 installation onto an x86_64 installation
and control where the extra arms protrude...

Inescapably /lib/ld-linux.so.2 must be a symbolic link to an ELF32
dynamic linker.
Why?
Because every ELF32 executable has /lib/ld-linux.so.2 hard coded into it.
Make that first.
Example:

# rm /lib/ld-linux.so.2
# ln -s /opt/ia32/lib/ld-linux.so.2 /lib/

If anyone executed the above commands on an ia32 box
then glibc is now broke.
To fix it type:

# /lib/ld-2.7.so /bin/rm /lib/ld-linux.so.2
# /lib/ld-2.7.so /bin/ln -s ld-2.7.so /lib/ld-linux.so.2

The fix commands differ if the installed glibc is a different version than 2.7

Then add to /etc/ld.so.conf
the directories that contain ELF32 libraries
and run ldconfig.
Example:

# cp /etc/ld.so.conf /etc/ld.so.conf.old
# echo /opt/ia32/lib &gt;&gt; /etc/ld.so.conf
# echo /opt/ia32/usr/lib &gt;&gt; /etc/ld.so.conf
# ldconfig

If &gt; is typed instead of &gt;&gt;
copy the old back to the original
and try again.

After doing that running AdobeReader and OOo-bin
and other ELF32 executables may be possible
assuming that there is a sufficient ia32 installation of
Sorcerer in /opt/ia32

The above commands may require some modification.
Since I do not have an x86_64 box
I have never tried it.
However, I estimate a high probability that something
like the above will work.

If someone wants to try it and report to me the exact commands
that were used and works
then we can add it to documentation somewhere?
Or add it to the AdobeReader and OOo-bin spells?
That way we can have IA32 executable support grafted onto x86_64
without having to make a serious mess out of the grimoire and cast.
