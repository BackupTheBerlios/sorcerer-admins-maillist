Logical expectation.
However, it does not hang.
prc starts /etc/init.d/xguest in the background.
prc waits for completion of /etc/init.d/xguest
/etc/init.d/xguest starts a piece of itself in the background
/etc/init.d/xguest exits
prc is satisfied
However, a piece of xguest continues running in the background.

The wait that prc performs is only to wait upon the
processes that prc starts in the background.

I understand how the use of backgrounding &amp; is confusing.
To verify this works I tested it at runlevel 4 and 5:
If it should hang it should definitely hang runlevel 4.

# grep -i end /etc/init.d/log.d/runlevel.4
End runlevel 4

But apparently it did not hang.
It works.
I booted it twice.
It opened two xterms and one xconsole
and twm as the window manager.
The fonts appeared fine, but tiny.
However, font size can easily be fixed.

The way the box booted reminded me of something.
It felt nostalgic like a Microsoft operating system.
I nearly expected it to prompt for the date and time.  :)

This will probably fit what you want.
It is fast, tiny, simple, eloquent.

Other programs can be added to ~/.xinitrc
in order to load a pretty background or other programs.
I suggest a looped script with delay that periodically
changes the background from one image to another.
That helps draw attention while avoiding burn in
and it may keep users awake.
I used to use something like that on my workstations.
But now I have konsole and other programs open covering
nearly every bit of desktop space on two monitors.
Therefore, I no longer use a background.
Just have it set to black.
