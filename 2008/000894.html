<PRE>&gt;<i> At the very least, before Kyle rolls an I/R, there should be a little time
</I>&gt;<i> where I or somebody with some spare CPU test compiles for every spell they
</I>&gt;<i> got, and report compile failures and hopefully fixes back to Kyle so that
</I>&gt;<i> the I/R has some chance of successfully compiling everything.
</I>
That seems reasonable, however not necessarily critical.
The initial installation of a Sorcerer I/R requires very little compilation.
After configuring the network and rebooting to the newly installed Sorcerer
the SA should first sync so that the grimoire and sorcery are current,
then newer; then update; and only after that begin installing new spells.
By this method the grimoire used to install software on the box is not
the same grimoire that came on the I/R


&gt;<i> What I personally would like to see here is that when Kyle decides to test a
</I>&gt;<i> new feature, he could call the testing version of sorcery sorcery-dev or
</I>&gt;<i> something. Then we can have a good play at it, and see if there are any
</I>&gt;<i> show-stoppers before calling it default and letting everybody in on the fun.
</I>
I have done that in the past.
Nobody used the test version.
End result is that it is released eventually
and would still contain the same bugs that
nobody spotted and reported.


&gt;<i> This approach has a few advantages.
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Warning. There is nothing like finding your box borked in the morning
</I>&gt;<i> after it was working just fine yesterday.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Recoverability. Knowing you can go back to the default branch to test
</I>&gt;<i> differences is reassuring.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Safety. Some people do not like testing, others do. By having the people
</I>&gt;<i> that like doing testing doing the testing, bugs bet squashed before it goes
</I>&gt;<i> distro-wide.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Effort. Kyle makes the changes he wants to make, puts it out as dev or
</I>&gt;<i> testing or whatever. If no-one is interested in testing the new features,
</I>&gt;<i> then he just releases it distro-wide and it is basically back to where we
</I>&gt;<i> are now.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Structure. Since we know we are testing, we can do all the things with
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcery that we do, and check the output.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me be the first to sign up as a beta tester of new features!
</I>
Sure.
In recent months or perhaps years my custom is to often upload sorcery
yet not update the version of sorcery in the svn grimoire.
Instead I test the newer sorcery on 3 of my boxes.
You can always try such sorcery, but it might have incredibly nasty errors.
One of the more recent sorcery I had uploaded that way once installed
was not able to download/leech sources.
I fixed it, but I forgot what the cause of the problem was.
However, the main idea is simple.
Nobody should probably use my testing sorcery
because it can come with bugs that make all you have
ever seen before pale in comparison.

If you feel squeamish about sorcery then do:
# cast grimoire; augur available sorcery
If the date is more than 3 days old then
the bugs are probably squished and nothing
new was added and nothing old was subtracted.

Now let us assume I did a separate test version of sorcery
for the changes to incorporate latest() functionality for spells
as a new selectable spell version progress.
Until SAs eventually updated to the dev sorcery then everytime
the grimoire is index it will blow error messages such as:
bash: latest: command not found
bash: latest: command not found
bash: latest: command not found
etc...

That said many of the changes in sorcery are done to support
changes made in the grimoire.
It is a symbiotic relationship.
That is why creating a testing release for sorcery is not as easy
as it would be for many other types of software.


&gt;<i> Kyle, these are just ideas, and I do not want to make sweeping changes to
</I>&gt;<i> the whole of Sorcerer. I see a little room for improvement in the way we do
</I>&gt;<i> things, and am just curious if you agree.
</I>
Some of the best martial techniques contain
very subtle and efficient movement.
I agree that the more which can be accomplished
for less effort is probably better than making
big leaps that require the solid dedication of
5 people to make work.

I know what I am about to say will sound like bragging,
but please bear with me since after 8 years of Sorcerer development,
I can say that I make it work by maximizing my contributions
so that in many aspects I can do the work that in a binary
based distro would require a team of people to accomplish.
Therefore, plans that require big effort would considerably
go against the grain of the last 8 years of Sorcerer development.

That said I both agree and disagree with Evert's question.
Sometime sweeping changes can provide a great deal of gain
while also minimizing complexity and effort.
The switch to version progress and having most spell variables
defined by functions was a very sweeping change.
And for it we have a cleaner looking grimoire,
less chance of unpaired &quot; and ' in spells,
spells that are more functional,
and SAs receive more control over available versions of spells,
indexing is faster, etc...
Sometimes we step and sometimes we leap.
It all depends on what the evaluation chart indicates.
And that is why Sorcerer becomes better at being Sorcerer
instead of mutating into something hideous.

But with that said I am not taking credit more than 35% for
what modern Sorcerer has become.
I make many decision concerning what will be implemented,
but as the years grow larger in number the suggestions and
feedback from SAs have substantial impact on how Sorcerer has changed.
More than anything else that is what makes Sorcerer a fun and useful distro.

Although Sorcerer is a mature distro in the sense it has been around
for a while,
it is not mature in the sense of a human adult who has finished growing.
Almost nothing about Sorcerer is a rule engraved in stone.
Change is both Sorcerer's greatest strength and greatest weakness.
And for that reason we should also take great consideration and time
in evaluating change to make sure that it will eventually accomplish
what we want.

I apologize for making such a verbose answer to Evert's question.
