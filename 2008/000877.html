<PRE>Well, mysql updates may be one way.
Because the website reported that 5.1.30 is stable
I already promoted it to stable in the spell.
Had I known sooner I would have held it back.
But now I will not roll it back without an assurance
that a reversion in the mysql version will not cause
database corruptions.

For SAs that do not want to use 5.1.30

# augur progress mysql 5.0.67
Will set the available version of mysql to 5.0.67 and hold it.
The last security release for mysql was 5.0.51b
So boxes using the secure progress for mysql will still
be at version 5.0.51b which may not be much different
than 5.0.67

Almost all of the time I must rely upon software authors label as stable.
Extensive testing of all software is prohibitively time consuming.
However, I did some testing with glibc 2.9
Having to reverse a glibc update or deal with bugs
can become something serious and annoying.
I was a bit concerned with the mysql update to 5.1.30,
however I did not hesitate the update after the freshmeat announcement.

I apologize for the inconveniences this may cause.
However, it the fitness of software if guaranteed at all
is made only by the software authors and not the distribution.
For now I will update mysql as soon as bug fixed stable version
become avaialble.
If the bugs are reported rapidly the instability might last only a few days.

Does anyone know when mysql was ?acquired? by Sun Microsystems?
And is there any relationship between that and mysql release stability?

Pekka Panula, do you want to make the grimoire mysql updates to
help keep it on track with what in practice is more stable?
Currently, I am giving mysql no extra attention and your
email suggests that concern and monitoring is necessary.
