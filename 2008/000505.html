<PRE>Bad news is that the berlios.de svn is not working.
This happens from time to time.

When it works again
I will be able to commit
the updates for kdm-v4 to run again.
You can thank Evert for reporting the problem.
Until he mentioned it
I expected that kdm-v4 crashing
was isolated to merely one of my boxes.

Meanwhile I will discuss changes to init-scripts.
Here is the init-script for kdm-v4, or what will soon become.

### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides: kdm-v4 gui_login
# Required-Start: $local_fs run ICE-unix
# Should-Start: $network $remote_fs udev xfs
# Required-Stop: kill
# Should-Stop: $remote_fs $network initramfs
# Default-Start: 4 5
# Default-Stop: 0 6
# Short-Description: kdm-v4 provides an x11 login.
### END INIT INFO

. /lib/lsb/init-functions

PIDF=/var/run/kdm.pid
SERV=/opt/kde4/bin/kdm
NAME=kdm-v4
CONF=/etc/kde4.config/kdm/kdmrc

restart(){ stop; sleep 10; start; }

parse &quot;$@&quot;



Fantastic when init-scripts fit within 25 lines, right?

The new variable for init-scripts is $CONF
I may have mentioned it before.
It often specifies a configuration file.
However, it can specify any directory or file.
Whatever it specifies must exist in order
for the service to start.
If it does not exist then a message to that
effect is printed instead of starting the service.
This way startup of kdm-v4 can be suspended
merely by renaming it's configuration file,
instead of having to:
# cast -r --deps init-scripts
or
# cast -r kdebase-workspace-v4

Definitely, whether this method of control is
boon or a bane depends on the service.
For example:

NFS server init-scripts are started when /etc/exports exists.
This way SAs with minimal knowledge of NFS
can achieve a working NFS server for minimal effort by:

# nano /etc/{exports,hosts.{allow,deny}}
# cast nfs-utils

The overall idea is to have cast ask less questions
while providing more logical expected solutions for init-scripts.
Haing cast ask no questions about init-scripts
would be a nice eventuality.
But the grimoire is not there yet.
Some services have either very old init-scripts,
overly complicated init-scripts
or entirely lack init-scripts.
Of course the most popular and used services
have the newest, most simple, and functional init-scripts,
generally speaking.

Remember that if a service should have started, but did not,
please check /etc/init.d/log.d/*
if a service did not start due to $CONF
then it will be printed in the sysinit and runlevel logs.

Will this change cause slower boots and longer logs?
Yes, but not so much that anyone will notice.
A box will not gain /etc/init.d/httpd unless httpd is installed.
Therefore, the init-script system of Sorcerer boxes will
still be nearly as terse as we have known.
Although many of the init-scripts that are installed mode 0700
on every Sorcerer box come from the init-script spell
Most spells that install a server will also install
the servers init-script exactly as expected.


Selection of optional requirements for spells still remains a chore for SAs.
Using always on and always off achieves faster results,
especially since Jan reported the bug involving always on/off.
Until then I expected nobody used always on/off.

SAs using newer sorcery may have already noticed
that the previous information screen about spells that require configuration
became a menu to select spells to configure.
Yes, you can skip configuration of spells.
In some instances this is useful for me.
However, it may not be useful to everyone.
I still recommend configuring spells that require configuration.

Even with the addition of linux-modular and initramfs
I am still trying to preserve backward compatibility with the old method
of using linux and a custom config and no initramfs.
To that effect I recently fixed a bug that Evert reported
concerning the starting of networks.
This way if networks is unable to start during sysinit
then a second attempt during the runlevel is made to start networking.

Thanks for the help!

Lastly, there may yet be a bug involving gdm
that causes it to not run properly on some boxes.
For a GUI login best choice are currently: xdm, kdm-v3

Sorcerer policy on software quality is that:
Sorcerer does not guarantee the fitness or usability of software.
Almost all the software that can be installed on a Sorcerer box
is written by people not involved with Sorcerer.
Please report bugs as you discover them.
However, bugs due to software authors will
most often be fixed by those software authors
and not the Sorcerer distribution maintainers.
No one person or even group of people can
take responsibility for the fitness of software
written by thousands of other people.
Even if you want to hold the distribution maintainers
accountable there is no way they could guarantee
the quality and suitability of other peoples' software.
And that is true about every distribution and not merely Sorcerer.

What would free software be without complimentary free bugs?  :)
