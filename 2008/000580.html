<PRE>Hmmm...
How odd...
hotplug spell has not existed for a while.
It should not be installed.
It should have been automatically removed.
udev handles hotplug events.

Many many moons have passed since that
box was last updated, yes?

Pry off hotplug.
Maybe that will fix the problem?
I have no boxes with hotplug installed
therefore I could not anticipate problems
that it might cause.

How long can a Sorcerer box go neglected?
3 months between updates = 95% of success
6 months between updates = 50% of success
12 months between updates = 100% of downloading the new I/R

sorcery-immune's neglect function allows for
elapsed maximum time of 2 weeks between updates.

Boxes updated less frequently than quarterly
will have an increased probability of not gaining
something that is important....
For example:

ID logs are removed.
However, sorcery used ID logs to construct LA logs
for boxes that did not have LA logs.
Now LA logs can not be automatically constructed.
Therefore, boxes without LA logs will not automatically
receive LA logs for installed spells.
Not a big problem, unless the box encounters
a problem that would normally be solved by
the LA check which is used to verify that
the content of libtool archive files is expected
to be correct.

Currently, logs in /etc/sorcery/log/ldd/
are moved to /etc/sorcery/log/elf/
However, in 2009 this fix goes away.
ldd logs not already properly moved
will age gracefully in /etc/sorcery/log/ldd/
being of no use for populating the library
cache when spells are dispelled.
Therefore, once that happens if
/etc/sorcery/log/elf/glibc does not exist
then that box will break HARD during
a cast glibc.

As more changes happen it becomes impossible
to check, without an ancient box, if the oldest
changes will still work properly in order to update
ancient boxes to current.
Update boxes every 3 months or sooner
and those boxes will encounter the fewest
problems updating.


Sorcerer SAs are busy people.
I understand that.
Put a dev box on LAG=1
Put production boxes on LAG=15
Enable immunity to neglect on both boxes.
Then, if something breaks on the dev box
you still have plenty of time to fix it and
prevent the problem from happening on production boxes.
Of course with LAG=15
if you require a fix immediately
the LAG will have to be temporarily adjusted
in order to download a newer grimoire.

Due to problems between subversion and httpd
the next httpd update for some boxes may be
a painful one that requires SAs to move/modify
files in /etc/httpd/
Sorry about that.
But one would have to ask subversion authors
why they used httpd's installed APR?
What a mess.
It aught not be shared.
It is not as if it is an ELF library.

epiphany and some other sources may break due to
the firefox update.
However, plenty of sources are
compatible with the newer firefox.
It is just one of those small storms
one encounters while sailing on free software,
unless you want me to hold firefox until
2010 when the epiphany authors catch up?
