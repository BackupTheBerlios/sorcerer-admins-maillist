<PRE>(head note): is there a way of shadowing a readd only file system with
a writable one?
why isn't [somescrfipt] &quot;#!/bin/bash ...&quot; the same as /bin/bash somescript?


I've had some success building these bootable CD images.  Last night I
had a basic kernel booting with a initfs (which really just had the
kernel drivers).  It also had busybox so I stubbed /init to run a
/bin/sh in the middle while I had built some stuff.

Encountered a minor thing...
  busybox modprobe wouldn't work to load kernel drivers.  Eventually
installed module-init-tools(?) which required zlib (and which I didn't
previously have).. then udevd and the kernel began loadding modules.
The first module i loaded by hand, but after replacing and rebooting,
modules came in automatically (BusLogic for instance as a vmware scsi
driver was the first I tried by hand, and busybox's modprobe did not
load.  It found it, just failed to load it.)

I have a minor issue... and maybe it'll end resolved in other ways...

to get /etc/init.d/udevd et al. to run, I had to prefix it with a
/bin/bash (yes a full bash, because I expect init scripts are going to
be smarter than busybox's sh will let them from sorcerer as a trunk).

Why?

I modified /init to be  &quot;#!/bin/bash &quot; instead of &quot;#!/bin/sh&quot;; and
nothing better happened... this is the /init script which is used on
sorcerer I/R CDs.  (minus the tail, and only having a /bin/sh in it to
provide access... ( this script does do /etc/init./udevd start,
trigger start, settle start   before running /bin/sh ) but I guess
bash still gets invoked differently from that standpoint than being
lauched as /bin/bash &lt;some script&gt;?


Other question, is there a file system like ISO which can be mounted
with write access, but really be the read only file system.... (as
opposed to like mount -t tmpfs; cp; use tmps instead of iso )

regarding concatenating CPIO archives... I started building smaller
blocks and just leaving them on the ISO image... taking them out of
the initfs which became 88M (.cpio.gz) and 120M or so as a .cpio.  (a
lot of it, like the first 27M are gzip compressed kernel modules, so
there's not much in compression that can happen, or X fonts).


so I have like a ...


37M initf (busybox, kernel modules, init-functions, udev,
linux-modular, libselinux, libsepol, zlib, module-init-tools, glibc,
readdline, ncurses, bash, e2fsprogs (I think this showed up as missing
when I got modules to start loading, and it recognized partitions),
util-linux ) (Do I need util-linux? I forget what it had I was
missing) (13M just for glibc, readline, ncurses, bash!, which the
remaining 24K is linux itself... )

(so at that point, everything to get /dev, /proc, /sys /, networking,
low level stuff, running and configured (by hand) should be present)

18M X.gz which is everything required to have X even attempt to run.
It takes very little time to decompress this...

another 1.9M of intermediate libraries like openssh, libjpeg, png,
mng, SDL, (ggi? no.), unixobc which application layer requires...

(openssh was added here, because, it had to be somewhere, getting
updates to and from the box should come from somewhere)

an a 43M user layer which I sorta wanted to build as a ISO - but the
issue of shadowing it with a hard drive or something... maybe just
cpio that too...
