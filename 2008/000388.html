<PRE>&gt;<i>  works fine,
</I>&gt;<i>  just wanna have the return value of hook not discarded since I do some
</I>&gt;<i> fancy stuff like a mount / -o remount,rw in prepare install hook
</I>
And if the remount fails?
Do what?
Exactly.
cast does not know what to do with a failed result.
The hook function can do something like:

if ! mount / -o remount,rw
then augur abort $SPELL
fi

It might work.
It happens at the beginning of prepare_install
Therefore, the actual dispel of the previously
installed spell and installation of the new files
has not yet begun.


&gt;<i> and remove
</I>&gt;<i> hooks.... I'm not sure about when to remount the drive ro, in post install
</I>&gt;<i> hook?
</I>
That may be an unfortunate decision since
filesystem modifications happen during post_install
Also init-scripts are installed.


&gt;<i> maybe it could break sorcery way of working
</I>Probably.
Keep in mind that after post_install runs
and the spell finishes casting an archive file
will be made and stored in /var/cache/archive
That might not happen if /var/cache/archive is RO

&gt;<i>  need a hook at beginning of cast and end of cast too could be the best
</I>&gt;<i> solution... some hook that will be called at each end of a cast (ie when all
</I>&gt;<i> the sorcery stuff  like log creation are done)
</I>
Even after a spell finishes casting,
cast may still be modifying the filesystem.
A hook at the end of cast is not the solution
for remounting a filesystem ro.
Okay util-linux finishes casting
while openssh enters prepare_install
the cast of openssh mounts the / RW
However, as files are installing
the closure of util-linux remounts / as RO
openssh fails during installation.
partially installed openssh can not be dispelled as
as openssh-failed.
Previously, installed openssh can not be restored.
All because the filesystem is mounted RO

&gt;<i>  but it works really fine and I think it's a good way to extend sorcery (for
</I>&gt;<i> example have sorcery been run by user and gain root privileges only when
</I>&gt;<i> installing....)
</I>
bash scripts do not support suid 0
And there is no way to preserve memory
if promoting from a user to root by su -
Also users can not execute /usr/sbin/cast
nor /usr/libexec/sorcery/cast because neither
have other executable bit.


&gt;<i>  thanks a lot, it's a good start and maybe finish
</I>
It is finished before it has started
if one expects / can be remounted RO
from a hook in cast.

And even if there was a hook_cast_finale()
what if dispel or leech is running?
remounting file systems RO while leech or
dispel is running may cause a wreck.

Another option is to run a daemon that
checks every minute or so to see if
cast, dispel, or leech is running.
If no PIDs are discovered
then remount / RO and stop.
However, starting a daemon such as
that from a hook_prepare_install
may have some extremely unfortunate consequences.
Sentinel will be preloaded with that daemon.
Also some function in cast might not return
because it is waiting for that daemon to close
or to separate from stdin, stdout, stderr.
Also if cast does function correctly
then why cast quits it may also forcibly
shut the daemon which is a sibling process.

Running a remount rw from prepare_install
is not problematic.
However, running a daemon from that point could be.

Best options are probably having a wrapper script
that you invoke before invoking:
augur easy
or cast
or augur sync; augur newer; augur update
That handles mount and remounting.
Or perhaps start a daemon just before
invoking cast or augur.
The daemon can remount / as RW
and then delay 5 minutes before beginning
to check if it should remount / as RO

leech can invoke leech and cast.
cast can invoke cast dispel and leech
dispel can not invoke cast nor dispel, nor leech.
leech and cast can run multiple concurrent processes.

Obviously, this makes adding a remount to RO
point to cast leech or dispel a difficult objective,
because it must also check that no other
leech, cast, dispel are running.

While not impossible it may be better to
run a daemon that scan as often as once per minute
to see if all the sorcery tools have completed and
it is safe to remount / as read only.
