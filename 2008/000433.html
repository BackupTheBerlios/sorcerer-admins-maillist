wpa_supplicant must be installed to / instead of /usr
/lib/firmware is already included on the initramfs.

ppp will also be installed to / rather than /usr

Thanks for spotting and reporting these important omissions.


Having networking start from sysinit has yet another advantage
that is more generally useful than potential for thin clients.
If for some reason a box can boot into the initramfs,
but yet the / can not be mounted then additional programs
to help identify and fix the problem can be scp or NFSed
into the running initramfs from another box on the network.

Banes: Longer before console login prompt
Boons: Thin client support
Boons: Network support for the initramfs.

Since the initramfs already had networking modules on it,
and already had most of the networking tools upon it
making this transition increases the volume of the initramfs
image by a ratio similar to tossing a rock in a lake.

Although networking and NFS client support
now start on the initramfs
The NFS server and sshd do not start until the runlevel
after all the filesystems are mounted.
Therefore, the change is not overkill.

For a long time I have felt apprehensive about starting anything
that is less than absolutely essential from within sysinit.
sysinit executes linearly and if a problem occurs then
then that problem also occurs before console login prompts
become available.
Therefore, a serious enough problem during sysinit could
prevent console login and therefore make the SA have to
resort to something like kernel parameter:
rdinit=/bin/bash
and then editing or removal of the bugged script in /etc/init.d/
before exec /init

However, I now feel as if the move of networking and NFS
client support from runlevel to sysinit is 51% better than
letting it start from a runlevel.
However, be advised of the following:

Any NFS mounted during boot can seriously stall a box
during sysinit if the filesystem can not be mounted.
Therefore, noauto is recommended if the filesystem
does not have to be mounted during boot and is NFS.

Having ppp start from boot may incur a wait state
if the template is designed to wait until the
PPP connection is established.
Therefore, when starting PPP at boot, fire and forget, is suggested.
However, that may prevent certain services that require networking
from being able to bind to the virtual PPP network device.
sshd and samba can not bind to the PPP
before the PPP device exists.
Therefore, there are yet still potential problems that can happen
from starting PPP networking during sysinit.

When using PPP I recommend that the SA or user
start PPP sometime after booting has completed.
