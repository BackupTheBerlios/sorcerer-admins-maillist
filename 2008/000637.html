<PRE>Image a bootable USB memory stick
with one unencrypted boot partition
and one entirely encrypted / partition?
I designed and tested it.
The devices names are correctly located by UUID.
Booting and updating the stick from different boxes
with different amounts of installed fixed disks does not cause a problem.


Boons:

1. Keep your IA32 USB stick and boot Sorcerer from any box IA32 or
x86_64 box with non-broken BIOS.

2. aes-xts-plain encryption provides absolute security for your files.
    If the USB stick is lost / will never be mountable without the
proper password.

3. No head seek time for random access and file loading.
    Therefore, faster execution of sysinit and runlevels during boot.

4. Less power consumption than fixed disk provides longer notebook battery life.

5. Produces less heat than fixed disk and/or CDROM.

6. The installation is bootable and runable and not like the CDROM I/Rs.

7. Fast access for small files, due to no head seek time.


Banes:

1. Slower maximum speed for file reading and writing as compared to a
modern fixed disk.

2. Lilo loading initramfs and linux by BIOS calls is slower
    than syslinux loading intiramfs and linux from CDROM by BIOS calls,
    and much slower than lilo loading initramfs and kernel from fixed disk.
    However, speed of this initial loading may depend on the box/BIOS

3. Limited maximum number of rewrites will cause USB stick to fail much
    faster than an average fixed disk.

4. Requires 20+ steps to create bootable USB Sorcerer
    as compared to the 1 step simplicity of burning a CDROM I/R image.

5. Slow access for large files due to lower throughput than fixed disk.


Here is what I would like help discovering:

What are the best USB memory sticks for installing Sorcerer on
that will have good speed, maximum life, and at least 32G of space?


The deployment of Sorcerer onto USB memory sticks has two probable methods.

1. I snail mail the USB memory stick with Sorcerer properly loaded and tested.

2. Add an additional method onto the menu driven installer for the I/Rs
to automatically partition, encrypt, and install Sorcerer onto the USB
memory stick
with the only question asked being the encryption password.


Is anyone interested in this technology?

If your company buys them from me pre-installed,
a SA will still be required to change the encryption password
and change the root password,
and install and configure additional software.

However, if purchased from me I intend to include:
installed KDE-v3, KDE-v4, GNOME, a nearly complete source cache
an hour of email technical support per key,
limited to 2 hours per week per customer
with all remaining support hours expiring one month from date of delivery.


Expectations:

With high ext3 commit value and updating only once per month
I expect that an installation of Sorcerer on USB will last
about 2 maybe 3 years, but duration depends on amount of writes
and quality of USB stick.

For those who do not require terabytes of space
Sorcerer on stick provides a greater convenience than fixed disk.
For workstation deployment and notebook deployment
Sorcerer on stick may be faster and easier than fixed disk
since notebooks will be interchangeable while
notebook users retain their personal USB memory sticks.

While a bootable USB memory stick for an operating system is a usable,
it is not an ideal solution compared to fixed disks.
For every boon there is a bane.

USB memory stick booting is not recommended for servers because
on some boxes BIOS/CMOS must be entered on every boot
and the USB memory stick must be selected at a boot priority
than the real installed fixed disk.

While the / is entirely encrypted the initramfs and linux kernel
on the unencrypted partition is entirely not encrypted.
If someone obtained the USB memory stick
then that person could install a trojaned kernel
or a program that runs during sysinit or runlevel execution
that effectively roots the box and/or uploads information
from the box to another once it is booted.
Therefore, encryption could be defeated if the USB memory stick
momentarily left possession of the intended owner
and was returned an used again after modifications
are made to the unencrypted partition.


Your input is invited.
I hope we can decide IF and HOW Sorcerer on stick should be provided.
