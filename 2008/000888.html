<PRE>Kyle, et al.

I have changed the heading for this thread, since we have drifted far from
the original MySql.

I like the direction that the discussion is taking on Sorcerer.

The last thing I want is for Sorcerer to become like a binary distro.

I think I can define my basic need of a stable grimoire.

I install Sorcerer quite a lot. Quite often it is to test the I/R, or just
that I have upgraded a machine of mine or whatever. Point is, I install
Sorcerer a lot.
More often than not this process has the added pain of spells plainly not
compiling simply because the last time anybody has tried to compile that
spell has been two years ago.

At the very least, before Kyle rolls an I/R, there should be a little time
where I or somebody with some spare CPU test compiles for every spell they
got, and report compile failures and hopefully fixes back to Kyle so that
the I/R has some chance of successfully compiling everything.

So, in order to test for compile issues, we have to compile. I sometimes
recompile everything just for the hell of it, but I would like this to be
more structured. I am quite open to someone asking me to re-compile my whole
box and check for compile errors if I know that very soon a grimoire is
going to go in to an I/R and we would like to have the minimum fuss with
spells not compiling because of conflicting versions and whatnot.


Completely seperate to this, but also related to Sorcery and it's
development is the issue of changes in the Sorcerer API.
I have no trouble that sometimes we make changes to the sorcery tools and
the grimoire that are not backwards compatible.

This is the only way we get to progress.

I know that Kyle does a lot of testing before he releases stuff in to the
wild as well. Sometimes, though, something slips through and we all get
bitten, hard. After a few years of running Sorcerer, I have seen this a few
times. Every time Sorcerer has bounced back better and better.

What I personally would like to see here is that when Kyle decides to test a
new feature, he could call the testing version of sorcery sorcery-dev or
something. Then we can have a good play at it, and see if there are any
show-stoppers before calling it default and letting everybody in on the fun.


This approach has a few advantages.
1. Warning. There is nothing like finding your box borked in the morning
after it was working just fine yesterday.
2. Recoverability. Knowing you can go back to the default branch to test
differences is reassuring.
3. Safety. Some people do not like testing, others do. By having the people
that like doing testing doing the testing, bugs bet squashed before it goes
distro-wide.
4. Effort. Kyle makes the changes he wants to make, puts it out as dev or
testing or whatever. If no-one is interested in testing the new features,
then he just releases it distro-wide and it is basically back to where we
are now.
5. Structure. Since we know we are testing, we can do all the things with
Sorcery that we do, and check the output.

Let me be the first to sign up as a beta tester of new features!
:<i>-)
</I>

Kyle, these are just ideas, and I do not want to make sweeping changes to
the whole of Sorcerer. I see a little room for improvement in the way we do
things, and am just curious if you agree.

Kind Regards,
-Evert Vorster-
