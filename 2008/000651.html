<PRE>Good idea.
However, requires opening the notebook,
removing fixed disk to install the SATA solid state flash drive.
Also a bit expensive, about $10 per gigabyte,
but less expensive per gigabyte as size increases.


However, perfect solution for anyone who wants a notebook
with a solid state drive that can run for many hours on batter power!
Good work finding this.

My preference is still for something USB that can be easily
attached and detached and also not very expensive.
32G flash drives are entering the $100 range.
The pircewatch page suggests that the 32G event
is the competition of choice at the moment.
That should help drive prices down.
Traditionally, I usually limit myself
to paying no more than $100 per fixed disk.
I half expect to find a solution in the $50 to $100 range.
Perhaps if there is sufficient interest we can gain
a better price for buying bulk?
But we do not have to do that if none of us
are responsible for updating many notebooks.
Having each person buy what they precisely require
may be best for enhancing just a few notebooks.

But if we want to build the ultimate Sorcerer notebook
then those OCZ solid state flash drives would be on the component list.

On the topic of hardware compatibility....
I recall NetBSD's logo.  &quot;Of course it runs NetBSD.&quot;
However, I wonder how they are handling driver support
for NICs, graphics, memory devices, web cameras and
all of the other new and weird stuff becoming available
that only seems to work properly on Microsoft boxes?
Anyone else feel the network device pinch while
sizing up notebooks for linux installation?
