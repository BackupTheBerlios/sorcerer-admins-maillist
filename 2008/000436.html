<PRE>Hmm...
Something about this I message I misunderstood.
Therefore, I am going to ask about it line by line:


On Tue, May 13, 2008 at 5:53 PM, J Decker &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sorcerer-admins">d3ck0r at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;<i> Uhmm... Sounds like networking should have individual levels
</I>
How can networking have individual levels?
Currently, if the runlevel switches to 0 1 6
then networking is shutdown.
Therefore, runlevel 1 still creates the expected
single user no networking environment.


&gt;<i> I ran into problems with networking starting in runlevel 3 because of
</I>&gt;<i> X.  I start X in runlevel 3 from inittab, which causes it to start
</I>&gt;<i> without network (sometimes start) and sometimes just die.
</I>
Unless using startx after console login
then X should be started automatically from runlevels 4 and 5.

&gt;<i> I solved my problem by implementing a script to start x also in
</I>&gt;<i> runlevel 3 and depended it on the network.
</I>
If networking starts in sysinit
then it will probably be ready for use by the time
xdm, gdm, kdm-v3, kdm-v4 or any other GUI login
starts in runlevels 4 and 5.


&gt;<i> The problem with this is that X doesn't happily restart.
</I>

The above sentence I am still confused about.


&gt;<i> xdm has no auto login feature.
</I>
I expect that if one were to adjust the configuration
files in /etc/X11/xdm/
that it is possible to configure xdm
to startup kiosk style.
I did it at least once back in XFree86 3.something.
However, using kdm-v3 or kdm-v4
or gdm would probably be easier.


&gt;<i>  - what's the official good way to have a process restart when it
</I>&gt;<i> dies?  init takes care of this very wll.
</I>
init can be made to restart services as soon as they die
by following the instructions in man inittab
However, if a service is started from an init-script
then it will not automatically restart if it dies.

However, it is possible to write the init-script
to invoke a wrapper and have that wrapper
invoke the desired service and
have that wrapper automatically restart the service
when the service dies.
However, whenever the wrapper program dies
then the service will probably no long restart.

When init from inittab is instructed to start a service
and restart the service whenever the service dies
then init will continue doing so until init dies.
init never dies, because if it does the kernel will immediately halt.

Fortunately, services started directly by init can be
specified to only start at certain runlevels.
For example, a different amount of console login
gettys are started depending upon the runlevel.
Therefore, adjusting whether a service continually
re-starts when it is invoked directly by init also
requires changing the runlevel of the box.

It should be possible to add an option to the
start_daemon to act as a wrapper for a service
and continually restart the service whenever the service dies.

Is that what you want?

There are no services, beside login gettys,
that I expect require this type of aggressive restarting.
However, about 10 years ago there was a problem with
xinetd that caused it to crash.
Back then I wrote a root cronjob to check if xinetd was
running and restart it if xinetd had crashed.
While not an eloquent solution it worked.

If xserver zapping is permitted I can understand
how a use could press ctrl-alt-backspace to kill
the X server and then no Xserver would be running.
And it is possible that the X server might crash itself.
Or if the window manager is holding the X server open
and the window manager program crashes then
the X server will also close.

xdm kdm gdm wrap the X server.
If the X server dies then xdm kdm gdm
gracefully restart the X server.
In most configurations this presents a GUI login.
Therefore, it is wise to have a kiosk started by
xdm kdm or gdm in order to automatically restart
the X server whenever the X server dies.
A guest user would probably not know what to do
other than restart the box if ctrl-alt-delete works
or a reset button or power cord is accessible.


&gt;<i> and a side question
</I>&gt;<i>  - what is the environment of an init script?  startx came up with
</I>&gt;<i> some strange configuration rather than /root/.xinitrc even though
</I>&gt;<i> whoami reported 'root'.  had to otherwise su root - startx.
</I>
The environment that init-scripts run in during boot
would be described as a non-interactive environment.
As you have already detected there is not a login
shell behind them because no logins have occurred.

startx is intended to be used after someone logs in.
It is not intended to be used from an init-script.
And it would be unwise to either:
login as root and start X,
or by some means start X as user root.
I strongly recommend that you make a user account
to su user_account - startx
if you definitely want to startx in that fashion.

Although I vaguely know how to set up kiosk style GUI with X,
I know that someone, perhaps Jan, has definite experience
using this style of configuration.
There should be a way to have xdm, kdm, gdm launch
and automatically login as a desired user and then execute
the ~/.xsession in order to start the desired window manager
and programs.
If you want to be certain that the user never has a chance to
modifiy ~/.xsession then make it root owned.
However, as I mentioned above,
kiosk style GUI is inappropriate
and an unwarranted security risk
to use in order to run programs as root.

If any programs absolutely must be run as root
then options exist such as wrapping it with sudo
and allowing that user automatic use of sudo for
the purpose of starting only that program.
And an even less secure method is making
the program suid and owned by root.
And also it is possible to ssh with
X11 forwarding enabled back into the same box as root.
However, performance with ssh X11 forwarding costs
a heavy price in CPU and will not do OpenGL.
And there are yet more complicated methods
for running X programs as root without logging in as root.

In order to use DRI rendering for some programs it may
be necessary to have in /etc/X11/xorg.conf the lines:

Section &quot;Module&quot;

# This loads the DRI module
    Load       &quot;dri&quot;

EndSection

Just add the load &quot;dri&quot; to the Module Section
which already exists.

Then create the DRI section by itself:

Section &quot;DRI&quot;
   Mode 0666
EndSection


That grants everyone using X access to DRI.


&gt;<i> what does su do that it gets an appropriate environment? (home directory?)
</I>
$ su -
starts a login shell.
I do not know if I can explain the difference between
a login shell and a non interactive script shell adequately.
You may want to read:
$ man bash

How the environment is set and what files are executed
when bash is started depends on whether the invocation
is an interactive login shell or non interactive interpreter.
BASH itself can also behave differently and have
different options enabled or disabled depending upon
how BASH is invoked and
whether BASH is login or non interactive.

Best recommendations are to ask Jan
how to set up kiosk style X using kdm gdm or xdm.
kdm is may be easiest to configure.
gdm is probably about as easy as kdm.
xdm probably requires manually rewriting some
files in /etc/X11/xdm/
