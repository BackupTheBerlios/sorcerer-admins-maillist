<PRE>Scruffy puts it too lightly.
Important things such as libxml2's python modules
are not built when Python 3.0 is installed.
Consequently, after I reinstalled Python version 2.6.2
I am still looking for things like libxml2 that could not be
automatically healed.

I have been checking prospective updates for a few days now.
I am not yet satisfied.
Therefore they have not yet entered into the grimoire.
However, it is becoming obvious that the version progress called &quot;latest&quot;
will become a catch for library updates mostly.
In general gnome libraries are fairly safe to advance.
However, as Evert has discovered and reported
video libraries are a big mess.
If we can make the video libraries and video software play nicely for a while
then it would be okay in my opinion we should keep it glued together
that way for a while.  :)

I am pleased that Python 3.0 compiled okay.
But it is not a drop in replacement for older Python.
I would not be surprised if significant bugs will be spotted and fixed.
Unless someone tells me that they are very eager to play with it in /opt
then I am still inclined to sit on that egg and let it hatch over time.

SAs that really want Python 3.0 for some reason can try it on their dev boxes.
A dedicated server without X, gnome, KDE and other fluffy might not
break as bad.

The old me probably would have decided....
Okay let us roll with the new Python, fix the bugs I spot now
and fix the bugs reported later.
But I have heard the cries for a more ?stable? Sorcerer.
If we want a less bumpy ride
then we must follow the old road
instead of blazing through the woods.
