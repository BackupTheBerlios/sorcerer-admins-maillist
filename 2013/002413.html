<PRE>However, before we say hello to the new year,
let us bid the old year farewell.
That might be best accomplished by saluting and
offering thanks to Evert Vorster who has yet again
been the #1 SA contributor to the project.

In 2012 I brought considerably new implementations,
functionality, features and also bugs to Sorcerer.
I do my best to spot and squish them.
I arrogantly estimate that I squish 90% of them
before they propagate distribution wide.

However, some bugs slip through
such as the unintentional utilization of instructions
for unmounting file systems on a monolithic boot
when the boot was modular with initramfs.
Likewise I recently approved an upgrade
of qt-everywhere-opensource that oddly passed testing
without a patch that is probably required
for compilation on nearly all other boxes.
Again Evert was on top of the situation and reporting the bug.

Evert provided excellent feedback through 2012
that brought innumerable bugs to my attention
which helped maintain and elevate the distribution
to a higher quality for SAs.
Amazing effort Evert!
Thanks.

My style of administration is
to encourage others to participate for amusement.
Consequently, I tend not to delegate tasks.
Instead I try to provide assistance
to those who have discovered and decided
that something should be accomplished.
Hopefully, each person will achieve their goal,
while having fun, and gaining a sense of accomplishment.
Consequently, the people who contribute
are skilled, generous, intrinsically motivated.
Like every year before no trophies,
no accolades, no rewards were given; only our gratitude.

The top 3 contributors this year were Evert Vorster
for bringing quality to a higher standard,
Pekka Panuala for providing incredible uptime
hosting for the website and services,
and Berlios.de for persevering and providing
subversion repository and email lists for the distro.
And let us not forget to thank the thousands or
perhaps millions of people contributing
to the free software projects that we use on a daily basis,
such as glibc, coreutils, firefox, gtk+, linux, udev, bash
and many more.

This distribution represents the generosity, freedom,
ideas, and contributions of many people.
Since free software represents a stepping stone towards
more freedom for every person let us continue hoping
that that free software has a long and prosperous future.
Happy new year.
