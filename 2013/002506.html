Heheh, that was a fun game.
So was Command and Conqueror.
We play a similar game called Warzone 2100.
# au begin warzone2100
The above command installs it.

However, what can be fun in a game
can become tedious as an occupation.
For that reason most trivial tasks
are delegated to the POSIX.
If a new kernel is installed
then the POSIX handles all the adjustment
that is required to boot the newer kernel
on the next boot.
That way the SA can forget about
editing the bootloader configuration file.
It is too mundane to be worthy of the SA's time and effort.



&gt;<i> What was that game
</I>&gt;<i> we had in the grimoire that was supposed to move away from
</I>&gt;<i> micro-management? Globulation2... still alive, I see... I wonder if I
</I>&gt;<i> can craft a spell for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
A spell for it existed in the past.
I vaguely recall it.
If a spell remains with the broke trait
for a long enough period of time
then it is removed from the catalog.
If the software authors for globulation2
were not maintaining the source
and it was becoming difficult to compile and install
then it would be considered for dismissal.
The importance accorded to the software project
tends to determine the amount of effort it receives.
Software projects of no importance that fail compilation
because the software author has not made a new release
in over 2 years are ejected from the catalog.
Debian competes in the niche of keeping software projects available
decades after the software author abandoned it.
I will not do that.
Also I will not maintain sources at older versions
and then back-port security patches from newer versions.

My favorite image viewing program was gqview.
However, it became abandoned ware and broke
and so I removed the spell from the catalog.
If I view images then I use qiv or gwenview.
Annexing maintainership for other people's software projects
is NOT what I do!
I do not care if participants in other POSIX do that.
I lack the time to maintain hundreds of other software projects
and this POSIX concurrently.

I consider myself a gardener.
I prune the dead portions from worthy software projects.
And I uproot software projects that died.
I try to avoid genetic modification of software projects.
So in other words I do not change the source any more
than is required in order to achieve compilation and linking.



&gt;<i> &gt; If we want to adjust performance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then utilization of CPU frequency and governors
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tends to be how we do it these days.
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, intel processors use P-states now, and cpufreq just does not work
</I>&gt;<i> on them anymore. It's a good thing, as they clock down further, run
</I>&gt;<i> cooler at idle, draw less power and respond quicker, and has the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to internally overclock single threads if the others are idle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Evert knows about that.
I buy AMD.
I am clueless.
Suggestions are welcome.



&gt;<i> All in all, much preferable. I just needed to switch off tickless
</I>&gt;<i> kernel for a specific version, as I think there is a bug in that
</I>&gt;<i> kernel version on mobile i7's, as there is no such problems on my
</I>&gt;<i> desktop i7.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Probably /usr/src/linux/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
specifies the correct one to use.
However, appending it is a bit tricky,
because of a bug that might not still exist in extlinux.
But if it still exists then...
then add the relevant information to file
/etc/extlinux/append

# cat /etc/extlinux/append
acpi_enforce_resources=lax

That is what I use on /+/base/
so that the proper modules can load
to report temperature, fan speed, and other fun things.

/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf is a generated file.
Changes made there become lost
when /etc/init.d/extlinux updates /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf
That might seem a bit strange at first.

The entire content of /boot/ is generated
and can be regenerated from installed files on /+/base/
/lib/modules/ provides modules
/lib/firmware/ provides firmware
/usr/share/linux/ provides a kernel and system map.
And all the initramfs images are generated from various
parts of /+/base/ file system.

Generating initramfs images is rather trivial,
that is to imply that any SA should be able to craft them.
However, the slightest error could fowl booting.
Therefore, it is of sufficient importance that the POSIX
provides the init-scripts to generate the initramfs images
and actually everything in /boot/

Some might argue that the POSIX usurps
an excessive amount of the SA's power by
automating /boot/ and compiler optimizations and more.
But those are things that a SA should understand,
but not want to be troubled with doing it manually.

Anyone who wants the full experience
and has a few months to spare on the exercise
should probably try completing the instructions
provided in the online book called &quot;Linux from Scratch.&quot;
It is great for training.

However, some tasks are worth manual accomplishment
and other tasks are best automated.
Which is which has been the subject of consideration.

Trivial and routine tasks should be automated,
especially when consensus can be achieved
about how to accomplish the task.
With that said, not everyone appreciates the
luxury sized initramfs images.
But it is convenient for most SAs.

A task such as deployment is not routine and trivial.
A computer might be deployed once and redeployed twice
perhaps as often as three times in it's lifetime.
Therefore, a SA should know as much as possible
in order to achieve a desirable deployment.
If the SA's task involves deploying hundreds of computers
then the SA's skill level should be such that the SA is capable
of designing and implementing a method for accomplishing
the task in an automated fashion.
If the POSIX provides that method
then it deprives the SA of a large portion
of the customization that could otherwise be accomplished
if the SA assumed full responsibility for the task.

And hopefully that answer the question which is,
&quot;What is the difference between SA management and SA micromanagement?&quot;
If the SA is performing a complex task as a routine
then that amounts to micromanagement.
That becomes a waste of a human's resources.
A tool exists for performing complex tasks as a routine.
That tool is called cron.
Our catalog has at least two cron implementations.
One is called mcron.
The other is called fcron.
Daily cronjobs allow me to fire and forget tasks.  :)

However, more to the point is that
micromanagement reduces the efficiency of a SA.
One one hand a SA that requires fluffy GUIs for every task is hardly a SA.
Yet the SA that micromanages every aspect has no
time to accomplish anything else.
The perfect example is doing &quot;Linux from Scratch&quot;
It is a fascinating way to learn.
However, by the time that the installed software projects
matches the desired manifest
then half of those installed software projects
have newer source tarballs released.

# au installed | wc -l
174

That is nearly 200 installed software projects for a /+/base/ root file
system.

# au installed | wc -l
687

A typical workstation root file system
has more than 500 installed software projects.

And if the POSIX is package based
then expect over 1000 installed packages.

Consider that on average a software project
might require 15 minutes to install.
And that includes duration for break
and reading relevant documentation, etc...
15 minutes * 700 software projects = 10500 minutes or 175 hours
or 7.3 days of sleepless effort or slightly over a month's worth
of 40 hour per week effort.

Anyway, the point is that without a POSIX providing
solid tools to mitigate the micromanagement aspect
then the duration and effort becomes an insurmountable obstacle.
That is the primary reason why people who run package based POSIX
are afraid and prejudiced against source based POSIX.
They expect that there are not enough hours in the the day
to endure the micromanagement that is required in order
to deploy a source based POSIX.
However, depending upon how the POSIX is implemented
the amount of effort and duration required could be less
for a source based POSIX than for a package based POSIX.

Honestly, I am uncertain how it currently evaluates.
I have not deployed Debian in over a decade.
It was my favorite package based POSIX.
At some point in the future I might install Debian
or a package based POSIX on my aging Athlon XP.
It has just barely enough memory to scrape by
compilation and linking of certain projects
such as MesaLib, llvm, and firefox.
But the computer itself is already very old.
A more modern computer easily exceeds the computing
power of the Athlon XP by 20 to 40 times.
But that does not make the Atlhon XP an unworthy computer.
It is simply my final relic from the age of 32-bit computing.
Well, actually, I have older hardware come to think of it.  :)
But I no longer boot it.
And I do boot and update the Athlon-XP.

Good question pertaining to micromanagement.
Thanks for asking.
As usual if something seems tedious
mention it on the email list and it can become discussion for automation.
That is quite literally how this POSIX was built up for almost nothing.
The very first implementation of spells lacked a requirement system
and lacked any method for installation of init-scripts.
There was a time when the SA did everything
to include assigning numbers to the symbolic links made
to init-scripts to ensure properly ordered execution of init-scripts
during sysinit and runlevel.
However, such things became subjects of discussion.
Recommendations were made and evaluated.
And we eventually transitioned to LSB style
and then evolved beyond LSB.
It is not the best nor the worst implementation,
but it is easily understood, reliable and it works.

Not everyone is pleased that I deprecated and eliminated
the menu driven deployment program.
But it had to go.
To enjoy the tasks of a SA a person must either
have the lore or be able to acquire it.
The earliest designs for this POSIX involved creating
a Linux kernel configuration.
If the SA was successful then their computer booted.
If unsuccessful then they were not able to deploy.
It was the test skill check.
Those who were worthy were rewarded.

The deployment docent is not necessarily a skill check.
However, it helps hone the lore which the SA might be lacking.
Those who lack the tenacity to complete deployment
face that same bitter ending that was encountered by
those who repeatedly failed to create usable
Linux kernel configurations back in the early days.

That is not to imply that I want anyone to experience an abysmal outcome.
However, administration tasks are better suited
and enjoyed more by people who cultivate tenacity.
Those who want instant success at a task
that far exceeds their comprehension and ability
are amused by &quot;Live CD&quot; style POSIX that specialize
in satisfying the requirements of the &quot;Forever Noob&quot; SA.

I realize that is a harsh attitude to have.
However, I simply want others to hone their skills
and have a fun time with this POSIX.
Those who arrive and yet are unable or unwilling to deploy
become disadvantaged in a way that hinders their ability to play.

I once expected that those people could auto-deploy
and then gradually hone their lore.
But that experiment was an abysmal failure.
It would be like handing over the controls of a class A fighter jet
to a complete novice while in flight.
&quot;Okay, it's your turn now, go ahead and get a feeling for how it flies
and then take us back to the air field, enter the pattern,
and land before we run out of fuel and crash and burn.&quot;
And then the novice says,
&quot;What is this thing called?  Oh it moves.
Let us see how far forward I can push it.&quot;
Everyone on board reds-out at -4 G
while hanging in their straps
and the jet dives into the ground at mach speeds.
Boom!

Except the experience is a bit difference.
The novice realizes that nothing is understood
and then grabs the releases overhead, pulls hard, and ejects.
They ultimate transition back to a noob niche based POSIX
because they felt as if they learned nothing after deploying
with a menu driven deployment program.

Hopefully, the deployment docent can change that outcome.
However, it is still considered an experiment.
Some people have expressed confusion concerning it.
It is not as obvious to use as I anticipated.
And I do not devote nearly as much time to honing it
as would benefit it, because I have other duties.
However, I hope it can become a hand-up for those
willing to climb the mountain of lore.

Many POSIX are POSIX and exactly what we expect by a POSIX
is a portable operating system for running Unix style software.
That said, a few POSIX aspire to be POSIX deployed on gadgets.
However, in general I still perceive that a computer with a SA
is expected to be something different and more flexible than a gadget.
For example, a laundry machine or a refrigerator
may have a computer in it.  So do automobiles.
Nobody expects to do their taxes with their automobile computer
or on the door of their refrigerator or to have completed forms
emerge with wet clean laundry.
Those are gadgets.
They are good for the single delegated purpose of the device.

Computers in contrast are not gadgets
and can perform nearly as many tasks as the operator wants.
However, it might not keep food cold or do laundry.
There is room enough for both computers and gadgets in this world.  :)

Also I am not against &quot;Forever Noob&quot; &quot;Live CD&quot; style POSIX.
Those also have a valued existence.
I simply do not want to compete in that niche.
I prefer source based administration.
And the boons and banes of source based administration
are converse of the boons and banes of &quot;Live CD&quot; style POSIX.
In some niches, package based POSIX will always
dominate over source based POSIX.
And that is why I do not offer a &quot;Live CD&quot; style POSIX,
although every year at least one person requests it.

I also receive requests for me to create a gadget based POSIX,
such as a POSIX that suitable for use on a raspberry PI,
or a One Laptop Per Child, computer that might only have
256 megabytes of installed RAM.
Those types of computers are only suitable for package based POSIX,
because they lack the 1G or more of installed RAM
that is required for linking certain software projects such as:
llvm; MesaLib; firefox.
Unfortunately, neophytes do not understand that
and expect that it is some arbitrary rule that I make.

That is enough of a digression.
My point is that I appreciate all types of POSIX
because each one is like a specific tool.
And as we know some tools are better for a task than others,
such as using a screw driver to sink a screw
instead of striking it repeatedly with a hammer.
Therefore, source based POSIX will be superior at some tasks
while package based POSIX will be superior at others.
And that does not make one POSIX better than another;
just better at a specific task or niche.
