</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The docent still guides the person at the keyboard step by step.
</I>
OKay that sounds innocent enough. Command line examples, etc?

&gt;<i> The docent provides information such as the location
</I>&gt;<i> of documentation that is relevant to the goals of the current step.
</I>
Yeah, I dunno. I don't have a problem with the 14 docs you authored,
because they presumably explain that step in the process.

I endeavored at one point to develop a cookboot/tutorial install manual,
which preceded sentient and the auto-desktop install. It reached almost
60 screenshots when I scrapped it because the install had changed
fundamentally.

Considering there are plenty of virtual consoles to go around, perhaps
directing the installing person to open a separate virtual console and
running an app which provides dialogs with docs that the installing
person can switch back and forth between while following the docent on
another virtual console?

I'm just not sure about telling someone during an installation, where
they're on the machine itself with no other around, that they should
visit an URL or file in /usr/doc or especially, a man page.

I have no idea what this new docent installer is going to provide and
how well it will document the install process so that a user can follow
along and complete an install, so we'll just need to wait and see, but I
didn't personally find the curses dialogs explaining what needed to be
done arrogant at all.

There's a certain amount of explaining and default options/selections
that need to be present during an installation so that someone with
little exposure can run through it, making reasonable choices, and have
a functional system that boots when they're finished.

For example, w/o a complete tutorial treatment like I provide here:

<A HREF="http://northtech.us/content/20120213/easy-lvm-installing-linux-entirely-lvm-partitions">http://northtech.us/content/20120213/easy-lvm-installing-linux-entirely-lvm-partitions</A>

...saying that someone can set up LVM2 for all of their mount points
(including /boot and /) and pointing them to a man page or /usr/doc/
simply isn't going to be sufficient for even many average SAs out there
to complete without a bit of it spelled out for them.

Now, if there was an ncurses based dialog which could offer such
information for the installing person to run in a separate virtual
console, then the power to be informed would truly be at their
fingertips, along with examples of how to accomplish what they might
want to do.

But to say, check the man page. Well, that's just going to cause people
to end the install IMO.

We definitely need documentation specific to Sorcerer Linux. Much of the
documentation scattered about the Internet is ancient and irrelevant,
with commands like scry, rather than showing that it's parrt of auger;
or just what auger, cast, etc., do and a comprehensive set of docs which
describe their complete usage.

Right now, what we have are a lot of docs and guidance that is only
contained in the archives of this list. I think that this keeps many
from adopting Sorcerer, or leads them to giving up. I'm particularly
concerned that Sorcerer not become thought of as, &quot;the Linux equivalent
of Minix, suitable for training but not considered for production server
environments.

&gt;<i> The person at the keyboard is responsible for learning and deciding
</I>&gt;<i> the commands to type at the command prompt.
</I>
I think examples and suggestions for safe defaults should be present.

&gt;<i> Therefore, at the step involving creating file systems
</I>&gt;<i> then the SA would read documentation about various file systems
</I>&gt;<i> and manual pages which describe the available tools
</I>&gt;<i> and finally the SA would type the commands to complete the step.
</I>
That's a pretty tall order I think. Sure, we're really only talking
about mke2fs, blkid, mkswap, swapon, tune2fs, e2label, mount, chroot,
and knowing about your fdisk tool of choice, but expecting noobs to
master concepts by referring them [primarily] to the man pages might end
up with them doing bizzare things they think they should, like:

mkfs -t ext4 -v -N 800000 /dev/sda4

...and totally confuse them when/if they are asked to generate their own
/etc/fstab, etc.

Some of those man pages kinda suck, from the perspective of finding out
what it is you need to do, when it is simple, as they serve to make the
installing person think that they need a whole bunch of arcane arguments
in order to get it to work.

Expecting someone to understand the basics of what they're going to need
to setup their partitions with fdisk and then offering a tool which
walks them through choosing the mount points (like earlier, perhaps
existing Sorcerer IRs), would be a step backwards, and like you say, the
more and most advanced methods are still available to them anyway.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So in essence the docent is most like a manual installation
</I>&gt;<i> but with the exception of having a virtual instructor nearby
</I>&gt;<i> willing to provide documentation that answers the SA's questions.
</I>
That sounds nice, but I'm not envisioning it so I hope it's what I think
that implies :)

Even Arch has a extremely comprehensive wiki that explains the whats and
whys of the hows - I don't think we have that.



&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Deployment can be as elaborate and complicated
</I>&gt;<i> as permitted by the desire and capability of the SA.
</I>&gt;<i> Or the installation process can be fast and simple.
</I>
Personally, I actually prefer the fast and simple, (in part because when
I install virtual machines for people I want to finish it quickly and
turn it over to the customer) - with the option of reverting more
control to myself when the simple portion with suggested defaults
doesn't meet my needs.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The docent method of installation
</I>&gt;<i> represents a radical change in distribution paradigm.
</I>
I'm interested in seeing what this is going to look like.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The new goal of 2013,
</I>&gt;<i> evident by the intention of providing a docent installer,
</I>&gt;<i> is creating an experience
</I>&gt;<i> where learning and honing skills is integrated into tasks of deployment.
</I>
I'm just afraid of the parallels to that of Minix, again. A distro great
for learning the nuts and bolts but not practical for mass deployment.



&gt;<i> and with the novice menus of the menu driven installer.
</I>&gt;<i> But in retrospect I realized that I was arrogant
</I>&gt;<i> and that I was providing convenience,
</I>&gt;<i> but at the cost of a disservice to all but senior level SAs.
</I>
I didn't see it that way at all. I actually really appreciated making
Sorcerer more accessible to potential adopters because of this.

&gt;<i> That is because the menu driven installer is fantastic for senior level SAs
</I>&gt;<i> who can already do manual installations blindfolded.
</I>&gt;<i> Skilled SAs require no additional learning to complete installation.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, the choice of using the installer or going manual was valid.
</I>
I think most people consider the point at which they are prepared to
learn the point at which they have an OS that boots and allows them to
gain access to the shell. Not during the install.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, for average and neophyte SAs
</I>&gt;<i> the use of the menu driven installer or Sentient installer
</I>&gt;<i> omitted or rather deprived SAs of a grand opportunity for learning.
</I>&gt;<i> I regret that.
</I>
Just learning Sorcery is a huge learning curve. And personally, think
the ncurses based installer afforded choice, not handicap. Some will
always seek to get closer to the machine level, while most want a
semi-streamlined, and what they perceive as sensible defaults, for
continuing to move forward in an install to move past the parts that are
too complicated for them to want to concern themselves with.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was naive for expecting that the Sentient installer
</I>&gt;<i> was compassionate to noobs.
</I>&gt;<i> The exact opposite was so.
</I>
hm...


&gt;<i> I want to nurture a favorable opinion.
</I>
I can only offer my personal caveats, and await the end product in order
to evaluate it from my perspective.

&gt;<i> I hope others will want to contribute feedback
</I>&gt;<i> so that the docent can become better and more comprehensive.
</I>
I hope this feedback so far helps some :)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first implementation will have about 30 steps.
</I>&gt;<i> That might seem like too many.
</I>&gt;<i> But of course some steps are entirely optional
</I>&gt;<i> such as the use of LVM2, mdRAID, LUKS, etc...
</I>
[code]
&quot;If you don't know that you want this then just choose to skip this
step, to choose sensible defaults, and move to the next item in the
installation process.&quot;
[/code]

&gt;<i> After feedback then I expect that the docent
</I>&gt;<i> on the following I/R could have closer to 40 or 50 steps.
</I>&gt;<i> I feel excited about that because each step
</I>&gt;<i> represents an opportunity for the person at the keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> to learn potentially useful knowledge.
</I>
I'm anxious to see the end result, but less than optimistic that it will
be friendly/simple enough for rapid production deployments.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To avoid prejudicing initial feedback
</I>&gt;<i> let us assume that instead of being nearly complete,
</I>&gt;<i> which it is, 
</I>
LOL!

&gt;<i> assume that the sub-project is at the design phase.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, I am eager to read about what steps
</I>&gt;<i> should be provided by the docent along with relevant documentation,
</I>&gt;<i> manual pages, etc..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, the docent offers the suggestion of 23 manual pages
</I>
Aaargghhh!

&gt;<i> distributed across various steps, 5 TLDP HowTos,
</I>
Arrgggghh!

&gt;<i> 3 documents from /usr/src/linux/ and /usr/src/linux/Documentation/,
</I>
Aaarrgghhh!


&gt;<i> a few documents in other places,
</I>&gt;<i> and 14 documents that I wrote.
</I>
I'm interested to see this :)

&gt;<i> The docent has already received considerable effort.
</I>&gt;<i> I still feel pleased about the possibility of unleashing it on the next I/R.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So if no feedback comes prior to the first release
</I>&gt;<i> it should still be usable and useful.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if anyone feels eager about the idea
</I>&gt;<i> then I am eager to read about what steps
</I>&gt;<i> and docs it should provide.
</I>
Well as you know I'm primarily a Slacker. I've always liked the
Slackware install. it can go real fast and when I want I can do my
reading up and self-education prior to installation by checking out
things on the CD like:

<A HREF="http://taper.alienbase.nl/mirrors/slackware/slackware64-current/README_CRYPT.TXT">http://taper.alienbase.nl/mirrors/slackware/slackware64-current/README_CRYPT.TXT</A>

<A HREF="http://taper.alienbase.nl/mirrors/slackware/slackware64-current/README_RAID.TXT">http://taper.alienbase.nl/mirrors/slackware/slackware64-current/README_RAID.TXT</A>

To have an install which can be as streamlined as Slackware's, or at the
option of the installing person to be more Arch like, with  the new
*docent* dialog (I'm presuming there's ncurses based dialog scripts in
the new paradigm since I have no other frame of reference to what it
might be), sounds initially, good.

Here's looking at it the reverse way...

CentOS install: Defaults to the gui install (which is still partly
ncurses based in the beginning), and launches DiskDruid -  a pointy
clicky thang that really annoys me to no end!

So I opt for the text based install (which they don't call the text
based install a/o CentOS 6.x - basic install, I think they call it), and
then when it comes time to fdisk that is fine. But when it comes time to
set up LVM... I can't even fricken mount my /boot or / on LVM - What?
CentOS uses an initramfs, right? So why fricken' can't I?

And of course there are other questions I *might* have, such as, &quot;Is is
okay after exiting fdisk to just mkswap and addswap, or do I need to let
their ncurses based dialog install do that for me?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again for reading this absurdly long announcement.
</I>&gt;<i> As usual the list typically emanates quietness,
</I>&gt;<i> and the suddenly explodes with a huge message,
</I>&gt;<i> or a series of helpful tips.
</I>&gt;<i> So now seemed like as a good a time as any to let rip a mighty message.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, it will be deemed worthy of reading.
</I>
I got this far w/o tl;dr'ing ;)

Kindest regards,
