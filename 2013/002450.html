</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [Sorcerer-admins] check which disk is which 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No menu driven installer exists for the 2013 I/R. 
</I>&gt;<i> It aught not to ask which disk. 
</I>&gt;<i> Instead a deployment docent is provided. 
</I>&gt;<i> And the SA should follow the steps and select 
</I>&gt;<i> and modify a plan and follow the plan to achieve deployment. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If any uncertainty exists about which disk to deploy on 
</I>&gt;<i> then run gdisk and examine the partition table. 
</I>&gt;<i> Partitions are typically granted different codes that 
</I>&gt;<i> describe either the operating system installed or the use of the partition. 
</I>&gt;<i> Another possibility is to try... 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> file -s /dev/sd* 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Allow the file command to a bit from each partition and device 
</I>&gt;<i> and report what is conjectured to be the use. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, if gdisk is run on the 80G disk and the 300G disk 
</I>&gt;<i> Then the total space reported for each disk will differ. 
</I>&gt;<i> And the larger disk would be the 300G disk of course. 
</I>&gt;<i> If confusion still exists remember to remove any removable USB SSD 
</I>&gt;<i> because those also can be assigned devices by udev. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Discover what is where on disks is usually an easily accomplished task. 
</I>&gt;<i> So of course remember to make backups before beginning because 
</I>&gt;<i> often mistakes can not be corrected. 
</I>&gt;<i> More than a decade ago I obliterated a partition with an operating 
</I>&gt;<i> system installed 
</I>&gt;<i> that I mainly only kept in order to be able to flash the BIOS of the 
</I>&gt;<i> mother board 
</I>&gt;<i> and other hardware's firmware to newer versions. 
</I>&gt;<i> But I did not merely delete the partition. 
</I>&gt;<i> I accidentally installed a test I/R on to it. 
</I>&gt;<i> And so it was totally gone. 
</I>&gt;<i> However, I only felt irritated for a moment, 
</I>&gt;<i> because I never had further use for that old operating system. 
</I>&gt;<i> RIP. 
</I>&gt;<i> So with that said, do backups and save the data someplace safe. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Go through the deployment docent slowly, 
</I>&gt;<i> enjoy reading the documentation, 
</I>&gt;<i> relax and expect to be at it for a while. 
</I>&gt;<i> That way no sense of urgency or feeling of impatience 
</I>&gt;<i> can become cause for making a mistake. 
</I>&gt;<i> The guidance from the deployment docent can provide 
</I>&gt;<i> a considerable amount to learn 
</I>&gt;<i> if the person at the keyboard wants to allocate the time 
</I>&gt;<i> to soak up all that good information. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The deployment docent alone is at least as good as 
</I>&gt;<i> computer based training program that costs thousands 
</I>&gt;<i> of dollars for a site license. 
</I>&gt;<i> And even better than having it print dumb-arse certificates of accomplishment 
</I>&gt;<i> for learning trivial stuff like how to write a crontab entry 
</I>&gt;<i> the end result is achieving deployment of a fancy powerful operating system. 
</I>&gt;<i> And that is way better than paper and trophies because an operating system 
</I>&gt;<i> runs software and we all enjoy running software, right. :) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I previously mentioned the goal is no longer to create an easy 
</I>&gt;<i> no questions asked deployment. 
</I>&gt;<i> I already accomplished that with a previous I/R. 
</I>&gt;<i> And people who did it learned nothing and continued to learn nothing. 
</I>&gt;<i> The only way people will learn is if they must type some commands, 
</I>&gt;<i> understand what those commands accomplish, 
</I>&gt;<i> and have read some documentation about those commands. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It can be fun. 
</I>&gt;<i> Remember that all the tools required to accomplish the task 
</I>&gt;<i> and even more than that are available the moment it the I/R completes 
</I>&gt;<i> booting. 
</I>&gt;<i> From that point onward successful deployment is achieved 
</I>&gt;<i> by the skill and tenacity of the person at the keyboard. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would not create an impossible to deploy POSIX. 
</I>&gt;<i> Doing so would be foolishness and useless for everyone. 
</I>&gt;<i> So never yield to frustration or confusion. 
</I>&gt;<i> A successful outcome is possible. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I so much wanted for the success of the person at the keyboard 
</I>&gt;<i> that I created the deployment docent that recommends documentation to read 
</I>&gt;<i> and provides a step by step guide to achieving a successful deployment, 
</I>&gt;<i> and provides definition for unfamiliar argot. 
</I>&gt;<i> It is almost like the virtual &quot;me&quot; standing behind looking over the shoulder 
</I>&gt;<i> willing to provide immediate assistance. 
</I>&gt;<i> That is plenty groovy is it not? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion is to relax, learn, enjoy. 
</I>&gt;<i> It has all the tools from util-linux e2fsprogs and coreutils. 
</I>&gt;<i> With utilities such as the file command and plenty more; 
</I>&gt;<i> deployment is like driving a F22 aircraft 4 block to the grocery store. 
</I>&gt;<i> It's powerful, impressive, and not stripped down. 
</I>&gt;<i> Deploy it to disk and it will fly high, fast, stealthy and 
</I>&gt;<i> be capable of completing almost any role designated. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Thanks for the explanation.
I have already a plan to make it work.
But I cannot use gdisk because my computer is too old to use gpt.
So I have to use a mbr-style disk layout.

My plan is this : 

/dev/sda1 /boot   15G
/dev/sda2  swap    4G
/dev/sda3 /        rest of the disk.

That plan I use on every Linux distro I use.
The only thing I have to do is to format /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda3 because they are now both used of another distro.

So I need to know where I can do this and where I must mount all the directories.
