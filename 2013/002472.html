<PRE>Hi there..

I have personally seen a couple of 20Mb Seagate MFM hard drives run
constantly from the day that they were the biggest storage a person could
buy till the day they were obsolete, almost a decade later. This was  in a
Novell Netware server, and they never missed a beat. It is my personal
opinion that as long as you don't move a hard drive while it's spinning,
and keep it cool, you can't wear out a hard drive just by using it.

Anyways, I welcome the utility, and it's fairly smart not to wipe the
kernel cache for what is basically a sequential one-time read of the root
file system. I guess this is why dd has the same functionality as well. I
wonder if tar also has this functionality, since tar's main use case is
reading through a lot of files.

While high throughput is commendable, being nice to the other running
utilities, especially as far as disk I/O is concerned, is top priority. You
yourself said that the main purpose of this utility is to provide
robustness to Sorcery. Having it complete in record time is a nice
benefit... but some of us have stupidly large root filesystems, and may not
want to wait for a lengthy disk I/O to complete before feeding our CPU.

</I>&gt;<i> The deluge is circumvented.
</I>&gt;<i> That seems exciting!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We might not yet see that type performance in other POSIX.
</I>&gt;<i> The method for accessing file content with O_DIRECT

</I>&gt;<i> The only utility I know about which provides an O_DIRECT method
</I>&gt;<i> is &quot;dd&quot; from coreutils.
</I>&gt;<i> And &quot;dd&quot; is designed to read only one file per invocation.
</I>&gt;<i> dd might not be a first choice for mass processing of files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, by sharing the code as a new utility
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps the functionality will be adopted by other POSIX.
</I>&gt;<i> Knowing that the files in the file system
</I>&gt;<i> exist and have proper content
</I>&gt;<i> is far more satisfying than assuming so.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The amount of file content read might be many gigabytes.
</I>&gt;<i> But that still amounts to less than 1%
</I>&gt;<i> of the capacity for most mass storage devices.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, I do not expect the additional throughput
</I>&gt;<i> contributing to an early demise for fixed disks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An amusing thought is that decades ago I was convinced
</I>&gt;<i> that atimes lead to quick demises for fixed disks.
</I>&gt;<i> I was probably correct at the time.
</I>&gt;<i> On older hardware atimes offered an opportunity for heads
</I>&gt;<i> to wear a groove in platters by constantly updating the atimes
</I>&gt;<i> for frequently accessed files.
</I>&gt;<i> The kernel's default implementation of atimes
</I>&gt;<i> was later changed in more recent years
</I>&gt;<i> to prevent frequent updates of atimes
</I>&gt;<i> for frequently accessed files.
</I>&gt;<i> Better late than never.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> However, pardon the digression.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These changes should improve integrity verification
</I>&gt;<i> while minimizing the impact upon performance.
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly, much data will be read from disk.
</I>&gt;<i> However, in a sorcery fashion
</I>&gt;<i> only one process performing heavy I/O will run.
</I>&gt;<i> After all the new code is in place and good to go
</I>&gt;<i> then the feeling of spontaneity should not diminish
