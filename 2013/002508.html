<PRE>First,
extlinux bootloader installed to the boot block of /boot/
should only happen when a newer version of extlinux is installed.
The most recently installed version of extlinux is recorded in
/boot/extlinux/version/

Secondly, extlinux differs from lilo in two important ways.
First, lilo creates a map of the kernel and initramfs and reads
the map from disk to know what blocks to read the kernel and initramfs.
extlinux can read files and symbolic links from ext2 file systems
and load the files that way which is why extlinux does not require
re-installation to the boot block after changing the configuration file.

Second, extlinux supports loading of more than one initramfs image,
while lilo only supports one.
Loading multiple initramfs images was a major factor for changing
from lilo to extlinux.
Having multiple initramfs images mitigates the duplication of data
and therefore allows more labels for less space which is why
the size recommendation for /boot/ dropped from 2G to 1G
when the POSIX switched to using extlinux as the bootloader.


/etc/init.d/extlinux is the init-script which is responsible
for generating the extlinux configuration file.
/etc/init.d/initramfs is the init-script which launches the init-scripts
that are responsible for generating initramfs images.
If running them then always run
/etc/init.d/initramfs before /etc/init.d/extlinux
However, they only require running during deployment.

When the sorcery tools update installed software
then the final stage of post involves running init-scripts.
If the new initramfs images are required then they are generated.
If a new bootloader configuration is required then it is generated.
Both /etc/init.d/{initramfs,extlinux} also run during shutdown and reboot.
That further guarantees that the initramfs and bootloader configuration
should both be proper prior to the following boot.

Generating the bootloader configuration file and generating
the initramfs images is a trivial task unworthy of a SA's attention.
Therefore, such actions happen automatically,
because it is a computer.
The computer serves the SA and user.
The SA is not to serve the computer typically beyond
what is required to maintain desired software manifest,
selecting when to update installed software,
configuring installed software,
and detecting and replacing faulty hardware.
In many instances default configuration files work fine.
So unless deploying a server what is expected from the SA
is rather minimal post deployment.

Do not all POSIX automate trivial tasks?
After we complete deployment we purty much sit back
and watch our computers drive along in auto pilot.
However, instances of interaction exist.

If important software fails to moil
then it is something the SA should investigate.
Backups should be done prior to updates.
Updates should be done on a test computer
or test root file system first.
All root file systems should be updated before rebooting.
Always update /+/base/ last.
If desired for a computer with significant uptime
then all non /+/base/ root file systems can be updated
more frequently than /+/base/
All root file systems should be updated at least quarterly.
A root file system that goes 6 months to a year without an update
is not expected to properly update and will probably require
SA intervention.

New Deployment Images, i.e. the iso9660 images,
are provided every 6 months to a year.
Downloading is recommended.
For deploying new computers using current DI are mandatory!
The SA can also deploy from DIR, Deployment Image Rescue,
which are USB SSD that the SA crafts from the /+/base/
of a deployed computer.

Most pre-compiled binary based POSIX, at least traditionally
if not still currently, require a complete redeployment
from new Deployment Images every other year.
That was always cause for headache.
Therefore, redeployment is not required with this POSIX.
Typical deployments often exceed 2 years,
for as long as the computer is still fit for the role.
However, the catch is that updating must happen
as rarely as quarterly.
Root file systems neglected for 6 months might not smoothly transition.
A considerable amount can change with this POSIX
in merely the span of 6 months.

As I previously mentioned; the prejudice of a source based POSIX
requiring micromanagement and extreme effort from a SA
is merely a prejudice and not grounded in fact.
SAs of this POSIX often cite it as preferred because,
&quot;it is fun,&quot; or because it requires minimal time from a SA.
The SA is often the most capable person in the office
and therefore might wear many hats to include web designer,
CGI author, DBA, or whatever else is lacking.
That tends to be because whatever lore the SA is lacking
can be quickly acquired from the Internet.
Consequently, the SA can not afford
to be indefinitely troubled by the tedium of micromanagement;
even if the capability for such micromanagement is provided.

Deployment probably imparts the impression
that the SA's tasks will be endless.
In fact far from it.
Be certain to explore the help pages
for each augur parameter by utilizing:
# au help $PARAMETER
augur is a crude tool, but immensely powerful
when wielded by a skilled SA that can chain commands together.
Here is a classic example:

Space running low on a root file system
and want to decide what should go?

# au lone

Hmm, but if there is much on the list
then can it be ordered by size?

# au lone | au size | sort -g

What about having that in a file to examine?

# au lone | au size | sort -g | tee /tmp/lone-piggy.txt

And the one listed at the bottom is the fattest hog of them all.
On my root file system for entertainment
the county fair #1 fattest hog prize goes speed-dreams
2267510671      speed-dreams

I can not actually say if it is worth 2G of space.
It does not seem that fancy.
But it consumes the space never the less.
That root file system looks like:

# df /
Filesystem     1K-blocks     Used Available Use% Mounted on
-               30832636 17704084  11539304  61% /

Therefore, plenty of space yet remains.
I can keep the prize winning hog for now.
But something in the future might require slaughter.

If I was feeling bold I could execute a command such as:

# au lone | sed 's:^:reap/mull/:' | au queue

Then that queues the output from au lone.
And I could view the queue with
# au queue | grep reap
Anything I want to spare I can remove from the queue with
# au queue -$SPELL
where $SPELL is the name of the spell
and it is prefixed with a hyphen.

I can specify the precise queue to remove the spell from
or allow the tools to remove the spell from every queue.

Then when satisfied with the queue I can execute
# au begin

Understanding queue manipulation is essential.
Each queue is owned by a utility.
Each task is delegated to a specific utility.
Each utility is allowed to execute at specific times.
This allows near optimal utilization of system resources.

The queues themselves have a physical location on disk
/aux/run/queue/
The directory hierarchy for queues is exactly
as the help page suggests.
queues and sub-queues are directories.
That which occupies a queue are files.
In some queues the files are empty.
In other queues the files contain PIDs.
And a file in a queue that has a future time stamp
is ignored until the time stamp is no longer in the future.
Therefore, the utilities can be instructed
to delay processing of queues until the computer
is no longer busy performing a primary role
such as a workstation.

Acquire the lore of BASH scripting
and the lore of augur
and the task of administration becomes simple.
I dare say that it might even be boring
if we did not have other aspects to be excited about
such as having multiple root file systems to admin.
Something entertaining always lurks just over the horizon.

Most workstations could do fine with just 2 root file systems.
A SA's workstation will probably have more.
Servers may have 2 or more root file systems depending
upon the amount of roles the server preforms.
So even while the limit is approximately 60
maybe nobody has actually deployed a computer
with 60 root file systems.
GPT provides a maximum of 128 partitions.
Carving a volume group into logical volumes
might not encounter a limit.

I realize that some people might want something
where an unlimited amount of root file systems is supported.
However, the main problem with that is eventually
system resources could be divided too thin.
No doubt such monstrous computers exist
with massive amounts of RAM, disk space,
and even more than 64 processors.
However, it was not part of my original design
to support monstrous computing power.
The amount of Linux virtual consoles is limited to 64
unless the Linux source is modified and re-compiled.
Therefore, I went with 64.
However, with implementation changes involving networking
then the possibility for more root file systems becomes.
reboot, shutdown, and booting will require longer.
Bugs in Linux could become intolerably annoying.
So it might not be ideal.

mrgetty is launched by the shift alt a key sequence.
Because it can be used to log into nearly any root file system
and the rootfs; that eliminates all reason to have each
root file system run it's own getty on a virtual console.
And so that is one limitation that was already surmounted.

The last thing to say about multi-root is why.
The answer is that a single Linux kernel can manage
resource provisioning for multiple roots far better
than any type of memory ballooning system involving
para-virtual and hardware virtual machines.
Or succinctly stated superior performance
and resource allocation is provided by multi-root.

Pre-compiled binary package based POSIX
are ideal for virtual computing especially the
ones which boot using a single small initramfs
or an initramfs image compiled into the Linux kernel.
However, those still do not make for more efficient
resource utilization than a multi-root source based POSIX
when comparing an equal amount of virtual computers
with an equal amount of root file systems.
And since we can do something different in this respect
we dove into this niche because it is simply too useful to omit.

multi-root has been available to every POSIX for about 1 year.
A few that pioneered the methods have probably
provided multi-root like capabilities for nearly 2 years.
It primarily depends upon the unshared namespace capability
that the Linux kernel provides which is a relatively new functionality.
I am not expecting all POSIX to become multi-root.
Many SAs loathe the additional complexity
and the traditions for files within /etc/
lack consideration for many of the aspects we do
which are considered essential for multi-root
which is to retain and utilize the rootfs as
if it were the host operating system or a hyper visor.

Ah, but that is probably too much information.
Remember to explore augur.
The POSIX will do almost everything for itself,
except update itself.
It used to do that also,
but the code was torn out because
headless SAs are an abomination.  :)
