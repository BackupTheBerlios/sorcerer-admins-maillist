<PRE>The GPT tools can transition to a GPT style partition.
As far as I can tell the age of the BIOS does not determine
whether GPT works or not.
What maters is whether the master boot record contains code
that is capable of reading a GPT.
However, I do not recommend changing to GPT partitions,
because GUID Partition Tables require more space
than legacy partition tables.
Therefore, the existing partition on the disk would overlap the partition
table,
which would be problematic.
However, if the second disk will contain only a single Modern Magic POSIX
then changing it to GPT should be fine provided that the bootloader used is
GPT aware.

A boot partition aught to be 1G in size or 2G in size if planning something
exotic.
A dedicated swap partition should be about 1/2 the size of installed RAM
and perhaps larger if intending to save memory to swap, power down,
and then resume on the next boot.
Remembering that sleeping to disk only works when the kernel being loaded
is the same as the kernel which ran when the computer slept.
Therefore, never suspend to disk after linux-* updates.

The deployment docent provides all of the documentation
required for answering those questions.
I can go ahead and copy 'n paste it into this email message,
but would not following the steps of the deployment docent
be more entertaining and useful?
If I copy something like the instructions for the 15th step
into this email then how do I know that all of the steps
leading up to that step are successfully completed?
The deployment docent helps guide through every step
even to include checking that a proper ext2 file system
is created on the partition that will become the /boot partition.

With all empty lines removed I typed something like 70 pages of
documentation
merely for the deployment docent.
Please read the documentation as it is provided and recommended.
It is most relevant that way.
I can not be expected to be able to provide all of that in an email message.

The docent provides relevant documentation when the command given to the
shell is &quot;docs&quot;
And when &quot;fore&quot; is given to the shell then the docent advances to the next
step.
Also try the other commands such as test and argot and ask.
This time the deployment docent is intended to be the teacher.
If impatient and not wanting to do all of those steps,
type fore and press up-arrow enter up-arrow enter up-arrow enter
until arriving at the desired step.
However, if deployment is unsuccessful due to skipped steps
then do not blame me.
The deployment docent provides a process of integrated learning and
accomplishment
that leads to the outcome of a successful deployment.

Maybe it looks ugly?
Maybe it provides too much to read?
I do not know.
But if someone asks me where are the docs.
Then my answer is the docs are right there,
exactly right where the deployment docent says they will be.

Therefore, please give it a try.
It is groovy, fun, rewarding.

Really, it is not a chore at all to wield.
It is not like being at the library and having to walk a few meters
between a card catalog, a table and a book, and a book shelf full of
reference
books that are not permitted for borrowing, and making the trip repeatedly
to learn and understand something.
Instead it is typing commands many of which are 12 to 16 characters in
length
and having the relevant information instantly explode onto the screen.
What an easy way to learn, right?

In the past I would tell people to visit TLDP, The Linux Documentation
Project,
and keep reading the documentation there until gaining sufficient
understanding
to wield the menu driven installation program.
In the past I would reply,
&quot;I provide a POSIX; I do not provide a class nor computer based training in
POSIX administration.&quot;

However, I have changed my mind about all of that.
People were hungry for knowledge, begging for me to teach,
and so I created the deployment docent which integrates
the learning and the accomplishment.
It is even better than a class because in most cases I have omitted
from the documentation portions where I described computing
in the 1970s 1980s, 1990s, etc.. and tried to make what I write
both succinct and currently applicable.

Consequently, the appropriate response to questions such as
where root file systems are created is:
&quot;Please follow the deployment docent because it explains
where this POSIX is programmed to recognize root file systems
and the files utilized during boot for mounting of file systems.

Modern Magic 2013 is a multi-root POSIX.
Yes, that means exactly what it suggestions.
A computer can have more than 1 root file system.
In order to accommodate multiple root file systems
certain semi-complicated changes were made.
It might not seem intuitive to all people,
but it continues a trend that was started before.
The deployment docent documentation describes it.

2013 Modern Magic has a much different feel to it than 2012.
Log files formats differ.
Log file locations differ.
Storage location for source tarballs differ.
Archive tarballs no longer exist.
Storage location for cache tarballs differ.

Reading the documentation elaborates on those differences.
And if dedicated file systems of sufficient size are created
for the portions of the file system that would store temporary,
long term, operating system data, and user home data
then enhanced performance can be achieved while fragmentation
over time can be mitigated.

I know Evert has something rather interesting concerning partitioning
and perhaps the use of loop backed file systems.
As for myself I have some of the dedicated storage and temporary partitions
shared among several root file systems.
That way I gain the enhanced performance benefit
without ineffectively utilizing available disk space.
The documentation describes how to accomplish this using mount binds.
That way each root file system for example can have it's own
unique /tmp/ directory that is backed by the exact same dedicated file
system
that is providing /tmp/ for all root file systems.

About 40 or so of the pages I typed were probably specific to this POSIX.
Some of it describes an entirely new support file system hierarchy unique
to Modern Magic because Modern Magic no longer uses places such as
/usr/src/sorcery/ /var/state/sorcery/ /var/cache/sources/
/var/cache/ccache/ etc...
The previously designated locations within the root file system hierarchy
were never ideal nor was it designed in mind for a source based POSIX.
The Modern Magic specific file system utilization
can be far more ideal for achieving and sustaining performance.
Read the documentation will tell what it is called where it exists
the roles of it's subdirs and more.

A person who deploys Modern Magic 2013
will want to read all of that documentation
otherwise they will be looking in places of the file system
no longer utilized and be,  &quot;What, nothing is here, so where are the source
tarballs?&quot;
Then they might encounter the POSIX specific hierarchy and either
not know what it is or maybe they might not notice it at all.
Or maybe they will see it and think,
&quot;Well I run no programs from that location so I have no use for it
so I will go ahead and delete it.&quot;
Then they rm -fr it and sorcery loses all of it's information concerning
installed software projects.
Oops, what a mistake to make!
Now the person must re-deploy because they just obliterated something
important.

In contrast a person who reads all about it by following
the steps and documentation suggested by the deployment docent
should achieve a much better understanding and ability to administrate it.

For what it is worth the transition could have been even worse.
Instead we are utilizing a more advanced implementation of System V style
booting.
Imagine the potential for confusion if switching to upstart or systemd
or some other type of currently developmental init/shutdown/reboot
implementation?

Consequently, I tried to keep 2013 as close as practical to 2012
while still achieving the new functionality.
But many important changes exist.
Anyone who skips reading the documentation
will almost certainly sow the seeds
that grow into a moment of future regret.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Subject: Re: [Sorcerer-admins] check which disk is which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No menu driven installer exists for the 2013 I/R.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It aught not to ask which disk.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Instead a deployment docent is provided.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And the SA should follow the steps and select
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and modify a plan and follow the plan to achieve deployment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If any uncertainty exists about which disk to deploy on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then run gdisk and examine the partition table.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Partitions are typically granted different codes that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; describe either the operating system installed or the use of the
</I>&gt;<i> partition.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another possibility is to try...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file -s /dev/sd*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Allow the file command to a bit from each partition and device
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and report what is conjectured to be the use.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, if gdisk is run on the 80G disk and the 300G disk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then the total space reported for each disk will differ.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And the larger disk would be the 300G disk of course.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If confusion still exists remember to remove any removable USB SSD
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because those also can be assigned devices by udev.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Discover what is where on disks is usually an easily accomplished task.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So of course remember to make backups before beginning because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; often mistakes can not be corrected.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; More than a decade ago I obliterated a partition with an operating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system installed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that I mainly only kept in order to be able to flash the BIOS of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mother board
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and other hardware's firmware to newer versions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But I did not merely delete the partition.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I accidentally installed a test I/R on to it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And so it was totally gone.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, I only felt irritated for a moment,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because I never had further use for that old operating system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; RIP.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So with that said, do backups and save the data someplace safe.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Go through the deployment docent slowly,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enjoy reading the documentation,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relax and expect to be at it for a while.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That way no sense of urgency or feeling of impatience
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can become cause for making a mistake.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The guidance from the deployment docent can provide
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a considerable amount to learn
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if the person at the keyboard wants to allocate the time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to soak up all that good information.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The deployment docent alone is at least as good as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; computer based training program that costs thousands
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of dollars for a site license.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And even better than having it print dumb-arse certificates of
</I>&gt;<i> accomplishment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for learning trivial stuff like how to write a crontab entry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the end result is achieving deployment of a fancy powerful operating
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And that is way better than paper and trophies because an operating
</I>&gt;<i> system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; runs software and we all enjoy running software, right. :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I previously mentioned the goal is no longer to create an easy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no questions asked deployment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I already accomplished that with a previous I/R.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And people who did it learned nothing and continued to learn nothing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only way people will learn is if they must type some commands,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand what those commands accomplish,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and have read some documentation about those commands.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It can be fun.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Remember that all the tools required to accomplish the task
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and even more than that are available the moment it the I/R completes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; booting.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; From that point onward successful deployment is achieved
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by the skill and tenacity of the person at the keyboard.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would not create an impossible to deploy POSIX.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Doing so would be foolishness and useless for everyone.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So never yield to frustration or confusion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A successful outcome is possible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I so much wanted for the success of the person at the keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that I created the deployment docent that recommends documentation to
</I>&gt;<i> read
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and provides a step by step guide to achieving a successful deployment,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and provides definition for unfamiliar argot.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is almost like the virtual &quot;me&quot; standing behind looking over the
</I>&gt;<i> shoulder
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; willing to provide immediate assistance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That is plenty groovy is it not?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My suggestion is to relax, learn, enjoy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It has all the tools from util-linux e2fsprogs and coreutils.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; With utilities such as the file command and plenty more;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deployment is like driving a F22 aircraft 4 block to the grocery store.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's powerful, impressive, and not stripped down.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Deploy it to disk and it will fly high, fast, stealthy and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be capable of completing almost any role designated.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the explanation.
</I>&gt;<i> I have already a plan to make it work.
</I>&gt;<i> But I cannot use gdisk because my computer is too old to use gpt.
</I>&gt;<i> So I have to use a mbr-style disk layout.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My plan is this :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/sda1 /boot   15G
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/sda2  swap    4G
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/sda3 /        rest of the disk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That plan I use on every Linux distro I use.
</I>&gt;<i> The only thing I have to do is to format /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda3 because
</I>&gt;<i> they are now both used of another distro.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I need to know where I can do this and where I must mount all the
</I>&gt;<i> directories.
