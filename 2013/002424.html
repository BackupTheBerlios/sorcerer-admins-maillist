<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I do not typically split a single source tarball into multiple spells.
Pre-compiled binary package based POSIXs
split source tarballs into several packages.
I irritate myself about it.
Parsing a loadout of 1000 installed spells is already a minor headache.
Parsing a loadout of 3000+ installed packages
providing the same software
requires more time and effort.
That is why I prefer loadout lists that
succinctly represent the installed software projects.

However, I set aside my prejudice
to weigh the boons and banes
of having several linux-* spells
instead of a single linux spell.
And I decided that having several linux-* spells
creates possibilities precluded by having a single linux spell.
Consequently, linux will be changing in a near future grimoire.

Here are the new spells:
linux;
linux-config;
linux-firmware;
linux-headers;
linux-kernel;
linux-modules;
linux-source

linux is a profile spell.

linux-source will cast first.
This is the base of the tower.
Adjusting the version progress for linux-source
also effects the versions installed
by spells linux-{config,firmware,headers,kernel,modules}
The versions for linux-{config,firmware,headers,kernel,modules}
are extracted from /usr/src/linux/Makefile
linux-source downloads a linux source tarball
and untars it in /usr/src/linux/

linux-config can cast after linux-source completes.
linux-config will create file /usr/src/linux/.config.stock
That is the stock configuration.
I create configurations for linux and store them in the grimoire.
Spells linux-{modules,kernel} will use either
{/usr/src/linux/.config.{custom,stock}
The custom config is preferred when it exists.

linux-headers will install the header files
provided by the linux source in /usr/src/linux/
into /usr/include/

linux-firmware will install into /lib/firmware/
the firmware that is provided in the linux source tree.
The linux source tree contains almost no firmware.
Most of the firmware desired to be installed
is provided by the firmware spell
which was previously called linux-firmware.
The firmware spell downloads firmware from a git repository.

linux-modules can begin casting after linux-config completes.
linux-modules compiles modules and installs them in /lib/modules/$VERSION/
The compilation of the modules is accomplished outside of /usr/src/linux/
Consequently, /usr/src/linux/ will not grow in size when linux-modules runs.

linux-kernel can begin casting after linux-modules completes.
This compiles and installs a kernel as /boot/$VERSION/linux

linux is a profile spell which requires previously mentioned spells.
The version for the linux-source spell will be the same
as the version that is on the linux source tarball.
However, spells linux{,-config,-firmware,-headers,-modules,-kernel}
receive versions extracted from /usr/src/linux/Makefile

SAs that want a kernel with a custom configuration
can copy linux-config to linux-config-custom
in the local grimoire and add the following line
with hold linux-config
Then the linux-config-custom will substitute for linux-config
after linux-config-custom is installed.
The customized spell can install a /usr/src/linux/.config.stock
or /usr/src/linux/.config.custom
Either is fine.

If a SA wants to one-shot a try a configuration file
then the configuration file can be saved as
/usr/src/linux/.config.custom
sometime after linux-source moils and
sometime before linux-{kernel,modules} moil.
Tedious to wait for it and intercept it,
but an opportunity is presented
that would require a custom linux spell
where a single linux spell provides
everything that can be installed from a linux tarball.

Another possibility which I intend to experiment with
is to have a linux-kernel-initramfs spell that can
install a linux kernel that has
linux's internal cpio initramfs fully populated with files from:
/bin/ /etc/ /lib/ /lib64/ /lib/modules/$VERSION/ /sbin/ and portions of /usr/
It would create a linux kernel that was over 100M in size.
However, in theory it would be able to boot without external initramfs images.
It is a bit like a monolithic kernel that is not actually monolithic.

Booting a xen computer with hypervisor
will only accept the first external initramfs image and ignore.
That causes a boot failure when
more than one external initramfs image must be loaded.
I already coded a solution for that
into the initramfs generation scripts.

Booting a PV guest on a xen hypervisor box
might only support the loading of a single external initramfs image.
I have not made an opportunity to check it yet.

Booting a guest operating system using HVM work splendidly.
And of course qemu can be used with the kvm kernel module
instead of the xen hypervisor to boot guest operating system.

Until significant improvements are added to this POSIX;
utilizing xen remains a task that can be accomplished
when a SA has a week of hours to spend on it.
It is very complex.
And xen source tarball is not at all usable as-is.

As we already know lilo can only boot a single external initramfs image.
That was one of the compelling reasons for switching to extlinux.
With extlinux a kernel can be booted
with a nearly unlimited amount of external intiramfs images.
I appreciate that convenience.
It is why awesome amounts of software
can be provided on the rootfs
without wasting massive amounts of space on /boot/
Consequently, I do not want to relinquish this convenience.

The possibility of being able to provide a kernel
with a fully stocked internal initramfs
is like a renting a hotel room with fully stocked kitchen attached.
For $300 per night it aught to have a kitchen!
That could be potentially useful in some situations.

Having the modules installed by a different spell
than the spell that installs the linux kernel
creates the possibility for creating an all-in-one linux kernel.
The cpio utility is the obstacle to accomplishing
an all-in-one linux kernel with a single linux spell.
cpio creates the initramfs images.
However, cpio does not provide a convenient method
for translating the names of the files it adds to the archives.
Files extract from an archive to the location where the file was added.
Therefore, the kernel module files must already be located in
/lib/modules/$VERSION/
for inclusion in a linux kernel's internal cpio initramfs.
Having a separate spell linux-modules allows for that task
of installing modules to /lib/modules/$VERSION/
to be accomplished prior to when the linux spell runs.

I apologize for the verbosity of this email.
Providing rationale explicates how
the added complexity gains commensurate functionality.
Rationale demonstrates that the changes
were properly evaluated and not implemented on a whim.

The following lines of this email describe the evaluation process
of the proposed implementation changes described above.
Reading further is only desirable for those who want
to learn how proposed changes are evaluated.
Proposed changes that are evaluated unfavorably are rejected.
Almost no proposed changes are approved and implemented without proper
evaluation.

Boon: simplicity of a single linux spell
Bane: complicated to customize
Bane: less than ideal for use with xen PV guests

Bane: multiple linux-* spells makes the installed spell loadout list longer
Boon: easier to customize the configuration of linux kernel and modules
Boon: possibility to create an all-in-one linux.

Keeping the current implementation scores -1.
Improving the implementation scores 1.
The evaluation favors the change.

Please pardon the inconvenience with adjusting to the change.
Fortunately, the linux-* spells contain less lines of code
than the previous linux spell.
Therefore, the new spells are easier to understand and customize.
The spell's name gives a very good hint
as to the task the spell intended to perform.

No speed is lost for having multiple linux spells.
Only one spell installs /usr/src/linux/
The other spells utilize the content of /usr/src/linux/
instead of having their own source tarballs.
Consequently, the newer implementation is faster
because the older implementation had sources for both linux{,-headers}

Thanks for reading.
I like everyone else would prefer to keep status quo
and minimize the amount of annoying changes
that require everyone to learn new methods.
However, change is beneficial
for adapting to the limitations
of technologies such as xen.

Modern computers can have hardware loadouts
that provide resources more than a magnitude greater
than a computer from the previous decade.
And the disk/mass storage space provided
has grown by several magnitudes.
Consequently, when the enormous power becomes overkill for a role
then partitioning the resources to guest operating systems
allows for the extra power to be leased to consumers.

Obviously, this POSIX is awesome
for utilizing the power of a modern computer.
However, when the power is partitioned to virtual computers,
created to the resource loadouts of legacy computers from a decade ago,
then package based POSIXs become preferred for deployment.

Obviously, package based POSIXs dominate the niche
of guest operating systems for virtual computers.
If deploying a POSIX to 16 or more PV guests
then any package based POSIX is lighter on resource usage.
When deployment of this POSIX requires 3G or more installed RAM
than many SAs will omit this POSIX from consideration as a guest
where the desired amount of RAM for each PV is 256M to 1G.
In that circumstance the boons of a package based POSIXs,
that still conform to the legacy computer paradigm, can not be dismissed!
