<PRE>No that is not Mister Getty,
but instead short for multiple root getty.

Initially, I expected the logind to grow on me.
However, as time elapsed I increased my irritation at it
until the point that it must be put down.
And so now it can buried deep within the bit bucket.
It deserves long rest for granting us about half a year of usefulness.

mrgetty is the replacement.
&gt;<i>From any virtual console, not running xorg,
</I>press together the keys alt shift and 'a'
which might also be written as alt-shift-a
It is a simple left hand key combo on a qwerty keyboard.
The getty will pop open in a new virtual console.
Do not worry about looking for it.
The active virtual console switches to the new virtual console.
The old active virtual console remains the same as it was.

mrgetty is easy to use.
press arrow keys until a root file system or rootfs is highlighted.
Press space.
mrgetty enters the namespace for it and runs /bin/login
It is simple and effective.

One of the potentially useful advantages about this method
is the ability to use system request k to kill whatever
is running on the virtual console before pressing alt shift a.
That way the person at the keyboard can feel assured
that the prompts received are absolutely genuine.

However, what I like best is the end of the flipping through
virtual consoles looking for the one that leads to the desired direction.
If I was working with 60 rather than 6 root file systems
then the quest for the proper login prompt would be daunting.

One of the less obvious boons of mrgetty
is that it is smaller and more simple than the logind implementation.
One of the less obvious banes of mrgetty
is that manually changing the keymap
to a different layout could clear the key sequence
that is assigned to KeyboardSignal.
Therefore, if alt shift a does not respond
then the solution is to execute
/etc/init.d/KeyboardSignal start

keymaps will only be loaded during sysinit
and no longer loaded during runlevels.
As far as I can tell the unshared namespaces
do not provide a provision for unshared Linux consoles.
Or more succinctly stated different root file systems
can not have different keymaps.
However, the keymapping mechanism used by xorg
is entirely separate and apart from Linux consoles.
alt shift a does not invoke mrgetty
when the active virtual console is running X.

As would be expected /sbin/init receives the request
as signal SIGWHICH.
The action is defined in /etc/rootfs/inittab.
sysvinit will recast and a suitable /etc/rootfs/inittab
will be installed.

The interconnecting parts are a bit more complicated than desired,
but the convenience of pressing a key sequence to pop open
a getty in a fresh virtual console seems very inviting.

The reason for not initially implementing it that way,
was because I wanted greater control over who can log in where.
However, I feel more than satisfied that can be accomplished
with password files and PAM.

Probably like many of us.
I spend more time interacting with terminal emulation programs
than I do with a virtual console.
However, when I am using virtual consoles
then I prefer the experience to not become unappealing.
This should sate my desire for present.

Someone might feel tempted to ask,
but what if it is bugged or not installed?
Will login be impossible?
The fail safe 60s login on virtual console #2
still begins sometime during sysinit.
Therefore, a SA can always log in there and snipe the bugs.
mrgetty is almost entirely BASH,
with the modest assistance of find, sed, column, sort, nsenter, etc...
mrgetty does not use dialog
and so no worries about dialog being broken.
mrgetty is also usable with an audio output console,
where hardware vocalizes the words printed on the console.
Therefore, it should not provide an accessibility problem.
It does not require
DirectFB, nor weston, nor MesaLib, nor Xorg,
nor even a mouse.
Therefore, if the keyboard and screen work
then it should work as expected.

Succinctly stated mrgetty should help provide all the convenience
of the easy type of logins we enjoyed with a single root file system,
yet still retain all the power of multiple root file systems.

Although not implemented with a menu
the SA can edit the configuration file for KeyboardSignal
and change it to a different and unadvertised key sequence.
Anyone else might see the typical prompt that says
press alt shift a for a login getty.
They press and press and press and nothing happens
if the SA assigned the sequence differently.
However, with that said please be aware that correct keycodes
can sometimes be difficult to discover,
and the keycode I use for the 'a' key might correspond to
the key located to the right of CapsLock even if that key
is something other than 'a' on a different keyboard
or different keymapping.

For the moment it remains a mystery that I can not investigate,
because I use very cheap US QWERTY 101 style key keyboards
made in China.
I go through keyboards somewhat quickly.

I am excited about mrgetty
and pleased to delete it from my todo list.
Criticism and suggestions are invited.
As a base implementation it is fine,
but it could possibly benefit from embellishment.
The changes should arrive in the next UTC 00:00
software catalog update.
