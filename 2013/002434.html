<PRE>The wait was completed.
Early downloads of the new I/R were completed.
Sorcerer SAs are now permitted to download a new I/R
which can be useful if deploying with GPT,
wanting to read the new documentation,
or wanting to do a multi-root deployment.

Please do not announce the availability of the new I/R
on any news sites.
That would invite a denial of service attack on the website
and distribution of the new I/R would be impeded.

The 2013 I/Rs significantly differ from the previous years.
Without 1.1G to 2G of RAM installed the x86_64 I/R
will fail during boot.
The IA32 I/R will boot with at least 1G of RAM.
2G of RAM is the minimum recommended amount
so that updates can happen without disruption.
The typical amount of RAM suggested is 2G minimum
with an additional 1G of RAM per processing core.
So 8G of RAM for 8 cores would be acceptable,
however 16G of RAM would also be fine and allow
for better caching and deployment of a computer
with several root file systems if desired.

Some software projects will utilize over 1G of RAM during linking.
Most will not.
An active process is expected to use somewhere between
almost no RAM and 1G of RAM.
Therefore updates along with regular services running
on a computer concurrently are still expected to devote
most of the RAM most of the time to the kernel's block cache.
Do not skimp on RAM when wanting to avoid a hiccup
during linking and during installations of large software projects.

For those who are wondering about the deployment method...
I did exactly as I suggested.
The new I/R lacks a menu driven deployment program.
Instead it provides a deployment docent that provides
logical steps for achieving successful deployment
along with suggestions for documentation.
On some of the steps the SA can request
that the deployment docent perform a test
to determine if the test was completed successfully.
That could be good for keeping the neophytes on track,
because even if the docs gave cause for confusion
a test can indicate if the step was successfully completed.

Hopefully, the deployment docent demonstrates
what I intended by saying that the POSIX is transitioning
from enterprise class to training class.
The goal is no longer to deliver new software
less than a week after a software author provides the source tarball.
Updates will be provided when time permits.
Instead Modern Magic is reclassified as a POSIX
for senior level SAs and those wanting to acquire
the lore necessary to become a competent SA.

In the past I tried to provide convenience.
However, some people asked for training instead.
And I arrogantly responded that the POSIX was a POSIX
and not a computer based training program.
I never understood why training would be less than easy,
when all the documentation is available for free
instead of having to purchase expensive computer books.
However, that was a folly on my part.
Providing convenience at the expense of SAs
not actually learning the commands
to accomplish tasks was a disservice.
Consequently, I redesigned deployment
an opportunity for training by defining goals for each step,
and suggesting relevant documentation
which is also provided on the I/R.

Memorization of an enormous pile of lore is not the goal.
Rather I hope those who follow the docent can
gain ideas about where to search for documentation
within the file system and useful commands such as
man and running programs with the --help parameter.

I am open to suggestions about how to redesign the POSIX
to make it better able to hone SA skills.
Feedback concerning the deployment docent is also invited.
It might feel a little less than complete,
but for a first attempt it seems sufficient.
I completed several test installations of the I/R
by following the instructions that the deployment docent provided.
And after becoming familiar with the steps
deployment does not require much more time,
just more typing than a menu driven deployment program.

My hope is that SAs who do the deployment docent a few times
will gain a sufficient amount of SA skill to write their own
deployment script that they can scp and run
in order to ease the task of mass deployment.

A &quot;no questions asked&quot; or &quot;mass deployment&quot; script
is trivially simple to write.
However, it also sacrifices an enormous amount of possibilities
that can be achieved at the command line.
Therefore, I want SAs to hone their skills to the point
where they can write their own deployment method
and gain the convenience desired while preserving
a desired amount of possibilities.

&quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; is deprecated.
No longer will a method be provided
to grant a deployed POSIX
to someone who lacks SA skills.
That experiment became yet another demonstration
that just because something can be done
is not always sufficient reason to do it.

The current goal is to hone the skill of all potential SAs
to the point of competency.
That should not be the goal of a POSIX,
but rather the goal of a book or computer based training.
However, I have decided that training
and acquisition of competency
will be the goal of this POSIX.
And that makes sense because
the power of sorcery is proportional to the SA skill
of the person who wields it.
Those who have gained skill know exactly what I am stating.

The decline of this POSIX in recent years
was most likely due to the transition to a system of deployment
where the SA was no longer required to create a Linux configuration
file that was adequate for booting the computer.
Deployment offers no challenge.
Administration offers no challenge.
It has been all close to entirely automatic for years now.
Even optimization of software is provided gratis.
I anticipate that the deployment docent being a slightly retro approach
will regain a bit of charm for this POSIX.
It could yet even tempt the minds of seasoned admins
to achieve a bit better deployment by using more dedicated file systems.
For those who prefer to avoid using LVM2
the GPT allows something like 127 or perhaps more partitions,
which is more than sufficient for deploying a computer with many root file
systems.
Those who did not previously deploy dev boxes for testing changes,
can now if desired deploy a developmental or testing root file system.
And many of the tasks that formerly required virtual HVM or PV
can now be accomplished with the multi-root system
while achieving far better memory utilization.

I have been using multi-root for a few months now.
And I can barely fathom how I previously endured without it.
It feels powerful and dynamic.
And thus far the only limitation I have encountered is firefox's objection
to being run concurrently by the same user in different root file systems
that share a bound /home/
However, I can always easily solve that by sshing to the rootfs
and pkilling firefox so that the process ends wherever it is running.

So with that said multi-root is fun powerful useful;
and waiting for SAs to wield
who want to step up and try a deployment with the 2013 I/R.
This feels very different than the experience of being a SA in 2012!
Those who try it will understand why most of 2013
was required to hone the I/Rs to near perfection.
