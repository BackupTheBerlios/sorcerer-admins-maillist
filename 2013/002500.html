<PRE>&gt;<i> There comes a time when the micromanagement loses its luster.
</I>&gt;<i> And the POSIX becomes the like a subordinate SA.
</I>Remember the original Warcraft? Talk about micro-management....
But I do believe it illustrates the point nicely. What was that game
we had in the grimoire that was supposed to move away from
micro-management? Globulation2... still alive, I see... I wonder if I
can craft a spell for it.

Some people are entertained by micro-management. Personally, I prefer
to have my computers do the work for me. The current Sorcery is quite
good at picking defaults, and in general working exactly the way I
want it. It can get quite boring administering a Sorcerer box... but
at least I now have time to start sorting through my digital
collections, satisfying both obsessive compulsive behavior in
organizing things, and the basic human need to keep on gathering
&quot;stuff&quot;


&gt;<i> If we want to adjust performance
</I>&gt;<i> then utilization of CPU frequency and governors
</I>&gt;<i> tends to be how we do it these days.
</I>Ah, intel processors use P-states now, and cpufreq just does not work
on them anymore. It's a good thing, as they clock down further, run
cooler at idle, draw less power and respond quicker, and has the
ability to internally overclock single threads if the others are idle.
All in all, much preferable. I just needed to switch off tickless
kernel for a specific version, as I think there is a bug in that
kernel version on mobile i7's, as there is no such problems on my
desktop i7.
