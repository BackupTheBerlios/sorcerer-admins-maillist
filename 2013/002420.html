<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I feel pleased by the many SAs offering help.
Thanks everyone.
Great ideas.
And I will re-read the URL that Bradley D. Thornton provided.
Until recently, I have been ignoring EFI
because I have no computers with the firmware
and did not expect to be able to test it in qemu.
However, I might have added an EFI bootloader to the grimoire.
If I can gain some useful understanding about it then perhaps
it can be an used with the next I/R or the one after the next.

I adjusted kernel configs.
When CONFIG_PARTITION_ADVANCED is set
then many questions are asked most of which seem irrelevant.

Advanced partition selection (PARTITION_ADVANCED) [N/y/?] (NEW)
  Acorn partition support (ACORN_PARTITION) [N/y/?] (NEW)
  Alpha OSF partition support (OSF_PARTITION) [N/y/?] (NEW)
  Amiga partition table support (AMIGA_PARTITION) [N/y/?] (NEW)
  Atari partition table support (ATARI_PARTITION) [N/y/?] (NEW)
  Macintosh partition map support (MAC_PARTITION) [N/y/?] (NEW)
  PC BIOS (MSDOS partition tables) support (MSDOS_PARTITION) [Y/n/?]
    BSD disklabel (FreeBSD partition tables) support (BSD_DISKLABEL)
[N/y/?] (NEW) y
    Minix subpartition support (MINIX_SUBPARTITION) [N/y/?] (NEW)
    Solaris (x86) partition table support (SOLARIS_X86_PARTITION) [N/y/?]
(NEW)
    Unixware slices support (UNIXWARE_DISKLABEL) [N/y/?] (NEW)
  Windows Logical Disk Manager (Dynamic Disk) support (LDM_PARTITION)
[N/y/?] (NEW)
    Windows LDM extra logging (LDM_DEBUG) [N/y/?] (NEW)
  SGI partition support (SGI_PARTITION) [N/y/?] (NEW)
  Ultrix partition table support (ULTRIX_PARTITION) [N/y/?] (NEW)
  Sun partition tables support (SUN_PARTITION) [N/y/?] (NEW)
  Karma Partition support (KARMA_PARTITION) [N/y/?] (NEW)
  EFI GUID Partition support (EFI_PARTITION) [N/y/?] (NEW)
  SYSV68 partition table support (SYSV68_PARTITION) [N/y/?] (NEW)

Consequently, that EFI GUID is somewhat like the needle in the hay stack.
Decided to try:

CONFIG_PARTITION_ADVANCED=y
# CONFIG_ACORN_PARTITION is not set
# CONFIG_OSF_PARTITION is not set
# CONFIG_AMIGA_PARTITION is not set
# CONFIG_ATARI_PARTITION is not set
# CONFIG_MAC_PARTITION is not set
CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION=y
CONFIG_BSD_DISKLABEL=y
# CONFIG_MINIX_SUBPARTITION is not set
CONFIG_SOLARIS_X86_PARTITION=y
CONFIG_UNIXWARE_DISKLABEL=y
CONFIG_LDM_PARTITION=y
# CONFIG_LDM_DEBUG is not set
CONFIG_SGI_PARTITION=y
CONFIG_ULTRIX_PARTITION=y
CONFIG_SUN_PARTITION=y
CONFIG_KARMA_PARTITION=y
CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION=y
# CONFIG_SYSV68_PARTITION is not set
CONFIG_BLOCK_COMPAT=y

I half expect that LDM and SUN might go unused
and KARAMA's description says that it is for an mp3 player.
If anyone wants more or less of a change
please indicate so and why.
I do put forth effort to make decent kernel configs
that should be usable distribution wide.
For that reasons an x86_64, an IA32 SMP, and an IA32 UP config exists.
That way each type of box can gain a slightly closer to optimal performance.
But the configs might not always be ideal
so I welcome corrections.

Some of us were wielders of the modern magic in days of yore
when creating a usable kernel configuration
was a mandatory installation task.
The lore of kernel configuration became the gatekeeper
that determined who can deploy the distro.
It had merits.
We laughed about compiling
a kernel and modules in under 2 minutes.
But the change in computers from 64M of RAM, to 256M of RAM, to 1G of RAM,
to even larger loadouts, and appearance of udev and other factors
shifted favor away from custom monolithic kernels.

Along with creating kernel configs
I also introduced semi-elaborate initramfs images
and decided that if we should pay the price
for the inconvenience of a much larger /boot/
then we should also reap the reward
of retaining a lofty rootfs after boot
to act as a look-down/shoot-down platform
for sniping unusual bugs or problems
that could occur in the root file system.
The metaphor may be obtuse.
Look-down/shoot-down is a type of aircraft radar
which enables the pilot to engage and destroy an air target with missiles
while remaining beyond visual range,
and perhaps while remaining beyond the possibility of retaliation.
Similarly while chrooted to the rootfs file system
bugs or strangeness in the root file system
would not likely be able to cause any disruption
of processes that are run from the rootfs.

Ah, but I digress.  As I was previously saying,
with the appearance of udev and other considerations
I eventually changed my point of view
and created a modular kernel config for distribution wide, etc...
Not everyone was in favor of the changes.
However, the changes seemed to solve more problems than were created.

I never expected to be capable of creating an ideal linux config.
I tried only because I expected the outcome would be the lesser of evils.
However, the methods of using a distribution provided configs
or using custom created configs both have boons and banes.
Likewise using modular or monolithic kernels both have boons and banes.
When considering from a single SA's point of view
custom configs and a monolithic kernel
that can boot without initramfs
might seem to be indisputably most favorable.
But when considering the variety of hardware
and the variety of skill in system administrators
then I arrived at the conclusion that a modular kernel
with a distribution provided configuration
would not be better,
but would achieve the lesser of evils.
And most SAs can neglect attention towards kernel configs.
That is convenient, especially for SAs that wear many hats.

So with consideration to what I wrote above,
please always feel free to make recommendations
concerning the kernel config.
By cooperating we can create an adequate distribution wide kernel config,
or perhaps at least configs adequate for  99% of the enterprise
quality servers, workstations, and laptops that we deploy.
I am adding extra emphasis to this aspect because
the situation involving GUID Partition Tables and the resolution
demonstrates that a how a deficiency in the kernel config
was spotted, reported, and corrected.
This is good.
With a changes such as this
the distro evolves to become more adequate
for deployment on systems with 2T and larger mass storage devices.

I find this change to be exciting,
even though I humbly admit
to being the last person to learn about GPT.
*chuckles*
Please feel free to give me a clue
when I am less than aware of current trends.
Thanks.
