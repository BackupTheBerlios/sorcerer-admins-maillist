I was not complaining.
Evert does plenty for promoting the viability and stability of Modern Magic.

That seems curious.
Please investigate if possible.
I am still on the 3.9.x version progress for Linux because
the NVIDIA-Linux-x86* proprietary drivers when I previously checked
were not yet compatible with the 3.10.x releases of Linux.
I have computers that are on a stable version progress for linux-source.
However, I might not yet have updated their installed Linux.
An problem involving initramfs generation seems both odd and rare.
I hope it happens so I might be able to see the effect and surmise the
cause.
Thanks for the forewarning.

A fun thing about free software is we are not all running the same versions
nor the same manifests of installed software although we are all running
the same POSIX.
Consequently, sometimes errors happen for some that do not happen for
others.
An example of that would be the now ancient problem of having gettext
fail compilation if emacs was installed.
Or maybe it was something else.
But the point was that one or more software projects failed to compile
if emacs was detected as installed.
And it was an error that I never encountered because I never install emacs,
except on the test box these days.
I tend to do text editing using nano.
But that problem involving emacs was probably years ago.
It was probably sticking in my mind because at the time I was using
a Pentium 3 for a test computer with limited fixed disk space and so
the manifest of installed software was considerably less than what is
supported by the catalog of software available for immediate installation.
Various reasons can contribute to some people encountering
problems that others might not.
In a way administration by source can be a bit like
a unique adventure for every participant.
Use of pre-compiled binary packages is far more dull in comparison.  :)



&gt;<i> Also, I like the newer initscripts that hide the successes and highlight
</I>&gt;<i> the failures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Oh that is a good observation, but it deserves elaboration.
The scroll during boot was mind blowing,
especially when running runlevels for 6 root file systems.
My eyeballs were going bouncy bouncy.
What I wanted was to be informed about errors
and to not have important scroll escape
the virtual console's scroll back buffer.
That was when I decided to allow overwriting
of messages which indicate a successful outcome.
I realize the prudence of doing so might seem questionable.
However, I am guessing that most SAs, myself included,
care to know what failed and not what went fine.
I am still considering whether to re-implement it as a toggle.
Should I allow SAs to select whether warning and success messages
from init-scripts are overwritten rather than followed by a line feed?
For the moment I merely implemented what was easiest for me.

Looks awful, but prods a reluctant SA into fixing the issue with the box.
&gt;<i>
</I>
Heheh.
Yeah, the red stays glued
and the green vanishes faster than snow during spring.
When I see the same red lines on all 6 root file systems runlevel
then that definitely impels me to say, &quot;I must do something about that.&quot;  :)

The main advantage to init-scripts is that the order of execution
should not vary from the order suggested by the symbolic links to
those init-scripts.
Therefore, what should happen properly
can largely be assumed to happen properly and in proper order.
In the event of a stall or a bug
then the currently output line should still provide sufficient information
in order to surmise the culprit.
And of course at least one virtual console will provide a login to the
rootfs
which should allow the SA to run ps -Af to see precise what is
stalled/running where.

Both the rate of scroll and amount of lines output during boot is so immense
that effectively parsing it might be an impossibility for some SAs
where lines indicating success contribute to the scroll.
This way seems a bit better.
I do not know what would be better.
I am considering whether an error message printed while an init-script runs
should also indicate the init-script running and the init-script that ran
before.
Most of the error messages are sufficiently precise that either the
init-script
generating the error message can be known by reading the error message
or it can be discovered by grepping for the error message in files located
in /etc/init.d/

I added the above paragraph to my todo list in order to grant further
consideration.
The output from init-scripts could benefit from a stronger focus upon what
is important.
And in general I accord importance
to those that fail to execute successfully.
I am aware that some SAs would want to allocate half the screen
or the entire screen to looking at a drawing of a penguin or some other
mascot
during boot instead of reading the scroll.
As for me, I rather read the scroll rather than
having useless fluff occluding the reading
of potentially important error messages.

I realize it was a change I sprung without any forewarning.
However, I was busy chasing some sort of boot oddness on my workstation.
If other SAs will be deploying computers with 3 or more root file systems
like I do
then watching scroll during booting will strain the brain if as verbosely
as before.
I would estimate it has at least 2 maybe 3 boons
when compared to that one bane of the loss of verbosity.
It might induce a small amount of shock when other SAs
first notice of how much is printing and how little is scrolling.
It might look like a bug.
However, I intended for it to run that way.

Boot scroll is a necessary evil.
We might as well focus upon what had an unexpected outcome
rather than to allow it to scroll off the screen while feigning ignorance
is bliss.
Of course this will induce the illusion of far more red and no sea of green.
*shrugs*
But to quote my father,
&quot;One awe-shit wipes out 10 atta-boys.&quot;
So in this situation we no longer bother retaining the green lines of
accolades
for the init-scripts that successfully completed.
What remains on the screen is mostly the stench of what went wrong.
I feel okay about that because it is what I want to know about.
