<PRE>Thanks again Evert.  ;)
Thanks for investigating and fixing calibre.

This fix will appear in the next UTC 00:00 catalog.
If calibre should be installed
then first recast qt-everywhere-opensource.
Although it probably recast recently;
I did not want to force it to recast again
to install the files required by calibre.
to install callibre execute:
# au begin qt-everywhere-opensource calibre; au scry

calibre is an ebook reader.
I have been wondering for some time why it failed to compile.
However, I never accorded sufficient attention to investigating it,
because my concerns were upon fixing and improving other aspects.
So if I allow a couple dozen spells to slide
while maintaining more than 3000 spells
then that is still very good coverage.
Yet with that said I am glad calibre is no longer broke.

By now any box that frequently updates
has received dsppu, the data shovel pinnacle performance utilities.
And like a proper shovel it is good at moving dirt, er data.  :)
Scan's plow horse is dsppu's baresha512.
By now everyone has had an opportunity to view a scan in progress.
Opinions and observations are welcome.

I have in my mind an opinion about how it should perform in general.
However, computers vary.
For example if a computer is unable to transfer bytes
from disk to RAM via the DMA then the CPU is used.
So on some rare legacy single processor computers
the consumption of I/O and processor cycles could be extreme.
However, on any modern computer the I/O should be reasonable,
and the processor utilization should be nearly negligible.

Please forgive if I seem to be stretching my arm to pat myself on the back.
My intention is to gain the boon of the task for minimal utilization
of processor and disk I/O while preserving the content of the kernel's
block cache.
If it causes problems then I would appreciate a memo.

Another aspect of scanning is the production of the
alien Must Read event log.

# au event-menu alien

One is generated each time the scan runs.
They contain content.
The file will list aliens.
If possible it will list the origin using ownership logs
if the &quot;own&quot; feature is enabled.
If not it will probably say &quot;origin\tunknown&quot;
Otherwise it will be &quot;$SPELL\t$VERSION&quot;

Some aliens are automatically removed,
especially when the ownership is determined
to be owned by a spell not currently installed.
Other aliens persist.
However, the SA can remove those or sort them out however desired.
Most aliens are benign.
Alien executable files could become a security risk.
Alien libraries might become problematic.
Every SA should possess sufficient skill and knowledge
to understand how to dispose of aliens or confine them.
If ignored then tactic responsibility for their
existence and disruption is accepted by the SA of the box.

With that the immune-exam-alien spell is being deprecated.
I wanted to be rid if it previously because significant I/O
and resource utilization during booting or soon after is undesirable.
With this improved method a fresh list of aliens will be awaiting the SA
soon after updating begins.
It is a fine time for accomplishing hunting of aliens and file integrity
verification.
And this is more favorable for those with unplugged laptops,
as opposed to always maintaining mode 400 on /etc/init.d/exam-alien
to prevent it from running during booting.

I previously mentioned scanning, but probably omitted
that the alien check is combined with scanning.
Sometimes I output too much information at once.
However, this is worth knowing.
So now everyone should know what that event log called
&quot;alien Must Read&quot; should contain.

Ha, all we need now is another utility called xcom to sack the aliens,
right?
Not.
But if some automatic disposition is desired
then enable the &quot;own&quot; feature.
A spell owned file is nearly the most certain form of ownership,
especially if the file is shared.
The UID on the file indicates the spell which last installed it.
