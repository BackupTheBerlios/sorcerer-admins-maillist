<PRE>For more than a week I mulled the subject of this email.
The solution was to move all related aspects into /aux/set/

/aux/set/rootfs/
contains directories files device nodes, and symbolic links
that will be placed on the rootfs during sysinit

/aux/set/realfs/
contains directories files device nodes and symbolic links
that will be placed on the root file system during runlevel.

Files formerly stored in
/etc/rootfs/
are now stored in
/aux/set/rootfs/etc/

Therefore, during sysinit

/aux/set/rootfs/etc/fstab is copied to /etc/fstab

Someone might be curious as to why I made this adjustment.
First, utilizing /aux/set/rootfs/etc/ helps mitigate confusion
as compared to using /etc/set/rootfs/etc/
Secondly, it deprecates directories /etc/cgroup/ and /etc/rootfs/cgroup/
Those directories become
/aux/set/realfs/sys/fs/cgroup/ and
/aux/set/rootfs/sys/fs/cgroup/ respectively.

Previously, separate methods existed for providing
persistent files on the rootfs, persistent files on
rootfs /dev/ /proc/ /sys/

Utilizing /aux/set/ deprecates the former 4 methods
in favor of a single method that is useful
for all aspects of maintaining persistent content
on virtual file systems.
And the elimination of a few init-scripts helps expedite booting.

Yes, the path /aux/set/rootfs/ is rather long.
Make a symbolic link to it if it helps.
Do not /etc/rootfs a symbolic link to /aux/set/rootfs/etc/

Evert made a suggestion that I remember as,
&quot;We should stop calling the rootfs the rootfs,
because it confuses novices who expect that
rootfs = root file system.&quot;
As previously mentioned kernel hackers are named it rootfs
and the documentation
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt
also uses the same nomenclature.
Therefore, consistency should be maintained.
However, the name realfs for a root file system
provides the additional contrast of it being
a real or device block backed file system
while the rootfs is virtual only backed by swap.
So as a compromise I did not change the expected nomenclature,
yet changed another to help avoid confusion.
Naturally, much documentation requires updates to reflect it.

Yes /aux/set/{real,root}fs/ modified content is preserved across updates.
It is treated as configuration files.
However, some SAs might want to omit keeping in synchronization
with the default changes.
I have no idea why.
However, if absolute control is a must
then /aux/set/$HOSTNAME/{real,root}fs/ will be used if detected
during sysinit and runlevel.
I definitely advise against it.
Instead modify files in /aux/set/{real,root}fs/

# /etc/init.d/set configure

I began the menu driven configuration functions
for assisting with modification of /aux/set/
but have not yet completed it or tested it.
Expect that to improve quickly.
However, I recommend diving into /aux/set/
with a shell and making changes directly
when changes are desired.

A persistent loglevel numeric value can be set in file:
/aux/set/rootfs/proc/sys/kernel/printk

I previously mentioned that I would eventually add functions to
immune-exam-transition to discover files /etc/*.rootfs and /etc/rootfs/*
and eventually relocate and rename those to how they should properly exist.
And so I did.
Consequently, some file will disappear from /etc/
and appear in /aux/set/rootfs/etc/

Every POSIX requires a method for maintaining
persistent content in virtual file systems across boots.
Udevd rules provides a fine example of how content
on /dev/ is re-created during each boot.
However, each POSIX probably has a method also
for /proc/ and /sys/

This POSIX has only one additional difference,
which is the added rootfs virtual file system.
Some of it's content must differ because
of multiple root file systems support.
And at first the added convenience
might seem unworthy with the added complexity.
However, since learning the method
for maintaining persistent content on virtual file systems
is required for every SA on each POSIX.

The method of using /aux/set/
as a prefix for data that go onto rootfs /dev /proc /sys/
becomes part of the lore SAs are expected to learn.
And after much consideration I decided that this method
provides maximum functionality for minimal complexity.
It is a worthy compromise that allows pristine backward
compatibility for a traditional /etc/
