<PRE>No menu driven installer exists for the 2013 I/R.
It aught not to ask which disk.
Instead a deployment docent is provided.
And the SA should follow the steps and select
and modify a plan and follow the plan to achieve deployment.

If any uncertainty exists about which disk to deploy on
then run gdisk and examine the partition table.
Partitions are typically granted different codes that
describe either the operating system installed or the use of the partition.
Another possibility is to try...

file -s /dev/sd*

Allow the file command to a bit from each partition and device
and report what is conjectured to be the use.

However, if gdisk is run on the 80G disk and the 300G disk
Then the total space reported for each disk will differ.
And the larger disk would be the 300G disk of course.
If confusion still exists remember to remove any removable USB SSD
because those also can be assigned devices by udev.

Discover what is where on disks is usually an easily accomplished task.
So of course remember to make backups before beginning because
often mistakes can not be corrected.
More than a decade ago I obliterated a partition with an operating system
installed
that I mainly only kept in order to be able to flash the BIOS of the mother
board
and other hardware's firmware to newer versions.
But I did not merely delete the partition.
I accidentally installed a test I/R on to it.
And so it was totally gone.
However, I only felt irritated for a moment,
because I never had further use for that old operating system.
RIP.
So with that said, do backups and save the data someplace safe.

Go through the deployment docent slowly,
enjoy reading the documentation,
relax and expect to be at it for a while.
That way no sense of urgency or feeling of impatience
can become cause for making a mistake.
The guidance from the deployment docent can provide
a considerable amount to learn
if the person at the keyboard wants to allocate the time
to soak up all that good information.

The deployment docent alone is at least as good as
computer based training program that costs thousands
of dollars for a site license.
And even better than having it print dumb-arse certificates of
accomplishment
for learning trivial stuff like how to write a crontab entry
the end result is achieving deployment of a fancy powerful operating system.
And that is way better than paper and trophies because an operating system
runs software and we all enjoy running software, right.  :)

As I previously mentioned the goal is no longer to create an easy
no questions asked deployment.
I already accomplished that with a previous I/R.
And people who did it learned nothing and continued to learn nothing.
The only way people will learn is if they must type some commands,
understand what those commands accomplish,
and have read some documentation about those commands.

It can be fun.
Remember that all the tools required to accomplish the task
and even more than that are available the moment it the I/R completes
booting.
&gt;<i>From that point onward successful deployment is achieved
</I>by the skill and tenacity of the person at the keyboard.

I would not create an impossible to deploy POSIX.
Doing so would be foolishness and useless for everyone.
So never yield to frustration or confusion.
A successful outcome is possible.

I so much wanted for the success of the person at the keyboard
that I created the deployment docent that recommends documentation to read
and provides a step by step guide to achieving a successful deployment,
and provides definition for unfamiliar argot.
It is almost like the virtual &quot;me&quot; standing behind looking over the shoulder
willing to provide immediate assistance.
That is plenty groovy is it not?

My suggestion is to relax, learn, enjoy.
It has all the tools from util-linux e2fsprogs and coreutils.
With utilities such as the file command and plenty more;
deployment is like driving a F22 aircraft 4 block to the grocery store.
It's powerful, impressive, and not stripped down.
Deploy it to disk and it will fly high, fast, stealthy and
be capable of completing almost any role designated.
