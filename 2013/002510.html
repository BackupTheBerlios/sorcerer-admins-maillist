<PRE>Everyone should know by now that the name for
the original source administration tools was
to stop people from saying &quot;package this&quot; and &quot;package that.&quot;
I picked what seemed like a fun and potentially useful theme
that might help mitigate the learning curve by using
nomenclature similar to that found in early
computer role play games, bulletin board systems, etc...
However, the paradigm of magic failed to encompass
the scope of the tasks being accomplished.
Therefore, the nomenclature expanded away from
the theme of magic and into the realm of simple English words.

Inspired by the evolution of the Linux kernel
the source administration tools also evolved,
along with most aspects of this POSIX.
The current techniques demonstrate the refinement
of more than a decade's worth of hindsight.
What began as a rude implementation become refined.
It evolved from the rude to refined and therefore has earned
the title EruditeTechnic.

The new name of the tools is: EruditeTechnic.
Erudite means to have emerged from a rude state into a refined state.
Technic is merely an alternative spelling and pronunciation
of the word technique.
All the magical themed nomenclature is deprecated.

So what have spells become?
Obviously, spells are now technic.
And since we have all become far too accustomed
to typing au the &quot;augur&quot; utility transmuted into aurum.
Aurum is the Latin word for gold.
Unlike the names for tools with delegated tasks
aurum has no special meaning to it.

Some of the aurum modules are changing names.
The menu driven aspect of the utility became
# aurum menu
# aurum survey
replaces
# augur scry.
To view a specific event log type
# au event $TECHNIC
where $TECHNIC is the name of a technic.
To view a mess of event logs for a technic
or for a period of recently elapsed days run:
# au events $DAYS
or
# au events $TECHNIC

Some of the command modules receive shorter names
some of them receive longer names,
yet most of the stay the same.
The new names are similar to the old names.
Learning to type the newer names
may require from more practice
than the instant required to learn the new names.

While I still do not want to write a manual page for aurum;
I did revise the terse documentation that goes with the tools.
It is installed as /usr/share/doc/EruditeTechnic/EruditeTechnic

As previously mentioned I want to re-iterate that
abandoning the previous theme became essential
for the refinement of the tools.
After the tools progressed from a tri-queue system
to having more than 10 queues
most of the old nomenclature had become useless.
However, for more than 6 months backward compatibility
was provided for SAs that did not want
to learn the method of loading queues using the queue module.
However, sufficient time elapsed for all SAs to discover
the superiority of wielding queues.
So after more than a year where /usr/libexec/sorcery/{cast,dispel}
no longer exited eventually /usr/sbin/{cast,dispel}
were also retired.

Many years before I mentioned that the tools and POSIX
would eventually depart from the theme of magic.
Some people responded by saying that they would
quit deploying this POSIX after I make such a change.
Yet, by now those SAs have either departed or
discovered that the lore they acquired is their power.
The tools are merely a convenience for sharing
technique that makes accomplishing the task of source
based administration nearly effortless and without tedium.

As usual consider the change in aurum module names
to be the annual Easter egg hunt.
More modules will likely change names between now and 2014.
The changes might seem fickle or cosmetic, yet few are.
Some changes might merely allow faster tab completion
of an aurum parameter.
So for the inconvenience of every change
at least one benefit is obtained.

Hopefully, everyone likes the new name.
It is a name as audacious as the tools.
And every year I say something like...
The sorcery we have now is nothing like
the sorcery we wielded just 2 years ago.
And it is so.
Therefore, it is overdue for receiving a new name
rather than merely a new focal subtitle.
I present EruditeTechnic.
