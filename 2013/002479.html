<PRE>Please grant extra attention to reboot testing following updates available
on 20131117.
I began implementing changes for the 2014 release.

The most prominent change is that /media/root/ became /+/

Root file systems should mount on direct sub directories of /+/

For deployed boxes /media/root/main becomes /+/main

The future recommendation is deployment with /+/main as /+/base
That is because that root file system tends to most resemble a skeletal
or base root file system since it tends to be pruned rather than having
additional software projects installed following deployment.

How I choose /+/ was complicated.
It involved looking at an ASCII table.  :)
It provides many boons.
But it can look somewhat confusing at first.

On the topic of confusion...
Having /etc/rootname used as the file for storing the hostname for root
file systems
became confusing for SAs that did not fully understand the purpose of a
hostname.
Since IP addresses can be assigned to a root file system's VETH
based upon the hostname; the hostname becomes useful rather inconsequential.

The solution was to deprecate existing methods in favor for my second
consideration.
/etc/$file.rootfs is now deprecated.
Files that should be available in /etc/ when on the rootfs should be within
/etc/rootfs/
While not exactly so the effect during rootfs is something similar to
cp -a /etc/rootfs/* /etc/
Therefore, /etc/hostname describes the hostname for the root file system
while /etc/rootfs/hostname describes the hostname for the rootfs.
Still slightly confusing?

The benefit of /etc/rootfs/ allows separate
/etc/rootfs/{passwd,group,shadow} files.
Or any possible useful and different files can be used on the rootfs.
Perhaps the most important file stored in /etc/rootfs/ will be
/etc/rootfs/fstab

/etc/fstab is the file for file system table for the root file system.
However, on the rootfs /etc/rootfs/fstab is copied to /etc/
and therefore becomes the file system table.

Wonderful, terrible?
Some of the support code for using /etc/rootfs/ has been in init-scripts
for months.
I have been testing it would advertising it.
However, more recently I did reboot testing to verify that
unmodified boxes should survive rebooting.
It seems to work.
However, if time permits
then I recommend moving and renaming configuration files appropriately.
That can help mitigate confusion later when trying to decide
whether /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.rootfs or /etc/rootfs/fstab
becomes the file that fstab file utilized during sysinit.

After the rootfs fstab file is installed in /etc/rootfs/fstab
then it can be easily sedited with the command
# sed -i 's:/media/root/:/+/:' /etc/rootfs/fstab
But probably better to edit with nano
if not comfortable using sed.

At my rate of progress I expect to have all my computers updated
to current file placement trends by first quarter 2014.
Consequently, I am not anticipating deprecating current methods.
However, in 6 months I might.
When I do so I will attempt to provide automatic update of configuration
files
using immune-exam-transition.
Still, better to make the changes oneself than to allow
me the opportunity to bug the files with sedit.
By the time I write the automatic transition code
I will have no deployed computers with with the deprecated placements
that I can use for actual testing of the code.

I might seem to be changing plenty for no good reason.
The reasons are good.
As the cliche suggests, &quot;hindsight is 20-20.&quot;
2013 offered plenty of opportunities for observation.
And I expect that these changes will help expedite deployment
and help mitigate confusion.

Consider that /+/ is faster to type than /media/root/
Would be nice if the shift could be avoided.
Using the keypad avoids the shift.
+ is the ASCII character with the lowest value
that is not anticipated to become problematic for most utilization.
However, + does become problematic when using pgrep, but not with grep and
sed.
So the answer to why use + is discovered by answering the question,
&quot;why to not use any of the ASCII values that proceed +?&quot;

I still have more changes to implement before 2014.
A large amount of it involves documentation revision docent revision.
Some of it scratches tiny itches like evolving from /media/root/ to /+/
for the location of root file systems.

For anyone who recently joined /media/root/ itself was the mount point
for the root file system when this POSIX supported booting only a single
root file system.
However, in 2013 that changed just slightly to add additional functionality
while not changing the location where SAs look.
However, retaining /media/root/ becomes an inconvenience
and cause for errors among slow typists.

Through most of 2013 I have wanted for a more concise path.
I considered /r/ for months.
However, I decided upon /+/
After sysinit completes
then most of the files being accessed
will be from the /+/ hierarchy.
Having such a tiny path with a low ASCII value
should enable it to be quickly parsed.
