<PRE>Hmm, I actually have both a spare partition and the Sorcerer ISO. Now if
only I could get some spare time I would be able to have a play at
installing it and booting it in conjunction with my already installed
sorcerer. :)

Come to think of it, the switch over to 3.10.4 had a hiccup, I had to run
/etc/init.d/initramfs force-reload before my system would boot properly
again. Also, I like the newer initscripts that hide the successes and
highlight the failures. Looks awful, but prods a reluctant SA into fixing
the issue with the box.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi folks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Howdy.
</I>&gt;<i> Normally, I go with what Evert says.
</I>&gt;<i> However, this is an infrequent moment.
</I>&gt;<i> The new I/Rs, Install/Rescue images, are only about a month old.
</I>&gt;<i> I did not ask Evert to review them.
</I>&gt;<i> And they are considerably different from 2012 I/Rs.
</I>&gt;<i> The 2013 I/R lacks a menu driven installer program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The 2013 I/R provides a deployment docent.
</I>&gt;<i> It is an enhancement to the shell that provides guidance
</I>&gt;<i> through the steps of deployment in a very orderly step by step method.
</I>&gt;<i> The guidance comes in the form of recommending for reading
</I>&gt;<i> documentation provided with the deployment docent,
</I>&gt;<i> HowTos, manual pages, and more.
</I>&gt;<i> It also provides recommended vocabulary or argot
</I>&gt;<i> and provides the definitions for commonly encountered argot.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone capable of completing a deployment
</I>&gt;<i> with the assistance of the deployment docent
</I>&gt;<i> hones general SA skills and improves understanding of how POSIXs work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The goal of the deployment docent is not merely deployment.
</I>&gt;<i> It was designed in response from SAs and non SAs
</I>&gt;<i> requesting that for computer based training to be provided.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After a SA successfully completes the deployment docent once or twice
</I>&gt;<i> then sufficient skill should be acquired for the SA to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to deploy a POSIX by the SA's own methods and without a deployment docent.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, the intended possibility becomes that SAs gained
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient skill required for writing a script for fast mass deployment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The 2012 and earlier Install/Rescue recommended method for deployment
</I>&gt;<i> was the use of the included menu driven program.
</I>&gt;<i> However, from feedback I concluded that the use of menu driven program
</I>&gt;<i> was not encouraging others to gain comprehension nor SA skills.
</I>&gt;<i> Those who lacked essential SA skills remained incapable
</I>&gt;<i> of piloting their newly deployed POSIX.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider the deployment docent to be a fun challenge.
</I>&gt;<i> The experience is almost like doing a deployment entirely on one's own.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet the docent provides assistance similar to a teacher
</I>&gt;<i> standing behind watching progress while being eager and willing
</I>&gt;<i> to answer questions and recommend relevant documentation for reading.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I assume it's OK to ask stupid newbie questions here? I've been reading
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what's in the iso and have my drives GPT partitioned/formatted, with swap.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a HOWTO or something written to get us newbies started (and, where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is it located) or should I just assume I'm on my own here?; which is OK if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am expected to do all this on my own but some pointers to help save me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some time would be very welcome.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Either an I/R on CD or an I/R on a USB SSD, or an I/R ISO9660 image file
</I>&gt;<i> should exist.
</I>&gt;<i> An I/R on CD or an I/R on USB SSD is required for deployment to actual
</I>&gt;<i> hardware,
</I>&gt;<i> in most situations where a POSIX is not already installed
</I>&gt;<i> and can be used to deploy the new I/R onto a fresh device.
</I>&gt;<i> An ISO96600 image file is sufficient for deploying into a virtual
</I>&gt;<i> machine's disk file.
</I>&gt;<i> I recommend QEMU as the choice of a virtual machine emulation program.
</I>&gt;<i> The I/Rs are all tested using QEMU's HVM, hardware virtual machine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Evert previously mentioned, the new I/R is always a moving target.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, what was written about the I/R before and provided in the form
</I>&gt;<i> of external documentation might apply in part or not at all to the next
</I>&gt;<i> I/R.
</I>&gt;<i> Having paper in hand is often a relaxing feeling
</I>&gt;<i> because it can be read the night before attempting a project.
</I>&gt;<i> However, a different compromise was selected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider the deployment docent to be like integrated documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> It provides step by step guidance for achieving deployment.
</I>&gt;<i> It can sometimes perform tests at certain steps to verify
</I>&gt;<i> that the SA has successfully achieved the desired outcome.
</I>&gt;<i> In many ways it can be superior to a written documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> Relevant documentation for steps previously performed
</I>&gt;<i> and memorized can be omitted from re-reading.
</I>&gt;<i> The deployment docent does not trap the SA into a box like a menu driven
</I>&gt;<i> program.
</I>&gt;<i> The SA is free to do whatever is desired from the shell
</I>&gt;<i> such as rescuing a previously deployed computer if that is desired.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main assumption behind this POSIX is that SAs
</I>&gt;<i> either have honed SA skills or desire to hone their SA skills.
</I>&gt;<i> Because of that a minimal amount of fluff separates the person
</I>&gt;<i> from the actual tools being used to accomplish tasks.
</I>&gt;<i> init-scripts are provided for accomplishing
</I>&gt;<i> certain delicate and complicated tasks
</I>&gt;<i> such as generating initramfs images.
</I>&gt;<i> However, some SAs elect to learn and master those skills also,
</I>&gt;<i> especially if a shaved initramfs is desired
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the luxuriously stocked initramfs provided by the init-scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> Please forgive the digression.
</I>&gt;<i> The main point is that SAs will learn
</I>&gt;<i> and the deployment docent guides learning by providing
</I>&gt;<i> the reference to the documentation that is relevant for accomplishing
</I>&gt;<i> the goals specified for the current step.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the documentation provided merely with the docent,
</I>&gt;<i> and not manual pages and not HowTos and not anything else
</I>&gt;<i> was trimmed of empty lines and printed 60 lines per page
</I>&gt;<i> then that alone would amount to about 70 pages of print.
</I>&gt;<i> It is an ample source of information.
</I>&gt;<i> I authored it.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> However, I do not recommend anyone read it cover to cover.
</I>&gt;<i> Far more understanding and skill is gained by applying the knowledge
</I>&gt;<i> during the process of deployment.
</I>&gt;<i> Reading a book about how to ride a bicycle is no substitute
</I>&gt;<i> for the skill gained by actually attempting to ride a bicycle.
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise the skill gained from the experience of deployment
</I>&gt;<i> is not imparted by merely reading 70 to 100 pages of documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead the goal is to have potential SAs dive in.
</I>&gt;<i> Everyone who has sufficient tenacity
</I>&gt;<i> will be able to surmount the challenge of deployment.
</I>&gt;<i> The amount of tries required before achieving a successful deployment is
</I>&gt;<i> unimportant.
</I>&gt;<i> Learning is important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When achieving a successful deployment was accorded importance;
</I>&gt;<i> a method for deployment was provided which
</I>&gt;<i> asked about 3 simple questions
</I>&gt;<i> and then created file systems and installed automatically.
</I>&gt;<i> The method was called &quot;Sorcerer Sentient.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> After discovering that those who used &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> were not honing their SAs skills;
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; method was discontinued.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The most simple explanation becomes,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;A skilled SA is more important than a deployed POSIX.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> The deployment docent might not transform computer neophytes into skilled
</I>&gt;<i> SAs.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it should impart some of the lore that a skilled SA will have
</I>&gt;<i> acquired.
</I>&gt;<i> It becomes a journey in a desirable direction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And before I forget to mention it.
</I>&gt;<i> The current 2013 I/R and tools on it are designed to handle devices
</I>&gt;<i> with both legacy partition tables and GPT.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the deployment docent only describes the tools
</I>&gt;<i> that are required for deploying onto GPT.
</I>&gt;<i> GPT is sweet, but I only began using it around first quarter of 2013.
</I>&gt;<i> So it still seems new and awesome to me.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am happy that GPT exists mainly because
</I>&gt;<i> I prefer partitioning over use of LVM2.
</I>&gt;<i> And having many partitions available is highly advantageous
</I>&gt;<i> when deploying this POSIX.
</I>&gt;<i> I used something like 12 or more partitions
</I>&gt;<i> when I last re-deployed my workstation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm coming from a Slackware background so I'm not afraid to type, read,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think, and look things up myself. I kept reading about 'Deployment' but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cannot find anything other than references to it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When the I/R is booted
</I>&gt;<i> it should provide the deployment docent
</I>&gt;<i> rather than a login prompt.
</I>&gt;<i> If a BASH shell enhanced with the deployment docent is not present
</I>&gt;<i> then that is unexpected.
</I>&gt;<i> Please describe what happens during the boot of the 2013 I/R,
</I>&gt;<i> and also whether it is the IA32 I/R or the x86_64 I/R.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I apologize if this is off-topic here. I just discovered Sorcerer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Linux, by accident, two days ago. I was at distrowatch and kept hitting the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'random distro' button when Sorcerer Linux appeared and peaked my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> curiosity. I was just getting ready to put Slackware on my new box until I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stumbled across Sorcerer Linux.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Slackware is older than Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> A long time ago I tried Slackware for a time and enjoyed it.
</I>&gt;<i> I tried many POSIX before Debian became my favorite
</I>&gt;<i> pre-compiled binary package based POSIX.
</I>&gt;<i> And then I wanted a tool for advanced administration from source
</I>&gt;<i> that I could use concurrently on Debian.
</I>&gt;<i> However, after I released sorcery feedback from others strongly
</I>&gt;<i> requested that I create an entire POSIX based upon sorcery technology.
</I>&gt;<i> But enough about ancient history.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The word &quot;Sorcerer&quot; now refers more to the role of the SA
</I>&gt;<i> rather than the name of the POSIX.
</I>&gt;<i> The current name of this POSIX is &quot;Modern Magic.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Sometime a while ago I forked my POSIX
</I>&gt;<i> into two rather different variations
</I>&gt;<i> that effected both deployment and administration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first I already mentioned was &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; and it was
</I>&gt;<i> discontinued.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes it easily granted a deployed POSIX.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet if anything non trivial was required such as network configuration
</I>&gt;<i> then the lack of SA skills became an insurmountable problem for neophytes.
</I>&gt;<i> SAs were not using &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; for training which was it's
</I>&gt;<i> original purpose.
</I>&gt;<i> It offered several tutorials through augur that would gradually unlock the
</I>&gt;<i> augur commands
</I>&gt;<i> as a person gained knowledge and understanding
</I>&gt;<i> of both the POSIX and tools wielded by system administrators.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Modern Magic&quot; is currently offered.
</I>&gt;<i> In 2013 Modern Magic was re-implemented in two important ways.
</I>&gt;<i> First, the tools were re-designed for smoother operation on 8+ processor
</I>&gt;<i> SMP
</I>&gt;<i> computers where I/O is primarily on a single fixed disk.
</I>&gt;<i> This was achieved by precise delegation of duties to specific programs and
</I>&gt;<i> queues.
</I>&gt;<i> And finally the order of execution and the programs allowed to execute
</I>&gt;<i> concurrently
</I>&gt;<i> was tailored to allow concurrent execution of tasks that require
</I>&gt;<i> significant CPU cycles
</I>&gt;<i> and linear execution of tasks that require significant device I/O.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second, the deployment docent was introduced on the I/R
</I>&gt;<i> in order to create an experience of deployment
</I>&gt;<i> that not only achieves a successful deployment
</I>&gt;<i> but also hones important SA skills.
</I>&gt;<i> No further attempts will be made to provide a POSIX
</I>&gt;<i> that competes in the noob friendly niche.
</I>&gt;<i> Those who attempt deployment must learn and master
</I>&gt;<i> the tools required for accomplishing the task of deployment
</I>&gt;<i> or switch to a fluffy bunny POSIX with happy snappy GUIs
</I>&gt;<i> that hide all of the complexity and usurp all of the power.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is &quot;Modern Magic&quot; just a name?
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, it is rather modern.
</I>&gt;<i> The implementation for 2013 and the deployment docent design
</I>&gt;<i> allows for what is called multi-root deployment onto a computer.
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is rather simple to understand
</I>&gt;<i> if a person already knows the definition for the argot.
</I>&gt;<i> The computer will run a single Linux kernel
</I>&gt;<i> that will coordinate resource utilization for multiple root file systems.
</I>&gt;<i> The rootfs which is provided from the initramfs images generated
</I>&gt;<i> from the &quot;main&quot; root file system acts like a firewall/router.
</I>&gt;<i> Each root file system receives it's own VETH, virtual Ethernet adapter,
</I>&gt;<i> which is part of a pair where the other portion resides in the rootfs net
</I>&gt;<i> namespace.
</I>&gt;<i> And the rootfs can forward packets to VETH for root file systems.
</I>&gt;<i> VETH inside a root file system
</I>&gt;<i> can have it's IP address assigned both dynamically and statically.
</I>&gt;<i> The use of:
</I>&gt;<i> VETH;
</I>&gt;<i> unshared mount namespace;
</I>&gt;<i> unshared net namespace;
</I>&gt;<i> unshared PID namespace;
</I>&gt;<i> unshared UTC namespace
</I>&gt;<i> and so forth are new functionality provided
</I>&gt;<i> in recent versions of the Linux kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> It is fun and useful.
</I>&gt;<i> For a while it was so new that developmental versions of util-linux
</I>&gt;<i> were installed in order to provide the tools required
</I>&gt;<i> for utilization of the unshared namespace functionality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For resource utilization multiple root file systems are superior
</I>&gt;<i> to both HVM and PVs.
</I>&gt;<i> HVM and PVs are implementations of virtual computers.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, another way of saying it is that multiple root file systems
</I>&gt;<i> provide superior resource utilization as compared to virtual computers.
</I>&gt;<i> A multi-root deployment is also superior for block caching mass storage
</I>&gt;<i> devices.
</I>&gt;<i> However, virtual computers are superior at the task of
</I>&gt;<i> isolating and protecting the host operating system.
</I>&gt;<i> Some situations exist where a virtual machine would be more desirable
</I>&gt;<i> such as for preventing an intrusion that gained EUID 0 from wrecking a
</I>&gt;<i> fixed disk.
</I>&gt;<i> Another way to protect is to lock it down with tomoyo.
</I>&gt;<i> Good to have a choice or to even to use both HVMs and multiple roots.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My workstation consists of 6 root file systems and 3 QEMU HVM virtual
</I>&gt;<i> computers.
</I>&gt;<i> Is that groovy?  Feels groovy to me.
</I>&gt;<i> I sometimes wonder how I ever managed before multi-root file systems.
</I>&gt;<i> Multiple root file systems are so convenient.
</I>&gt;<i> I can either log in via a virtual console or
</I>&gt;<i> using the GUI login program running on a root file system
</I>&gt;<i> or ssh into it, or scp files to and from it.
</I>&gt;<i> The effect of multiple root file systems is exactly the same
</I>&gt;<i> as if I had additional computers on my LAN.
</I>&gt;<i> And by using control groups a specific amount of resources
</I>&gt;<i> can be delegated to each root file system.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, I tend to prevent most root file systems
</I>&gt;<i> from running processes on the first processor.
</I>&gt;<i> Many of the root file systems have both a RAM soft and hard utilization
</I>&gt;<i> limits
</I>&gt;<i> and a swap utilization limit.
</I>&gt;<i> If for some odd and unexpected reason a fork bomb 'sploded on a root file
</I>&gt;<i> system
</I>&gt;<i> then it would not be able to create a denial of service in other root file
</I>&gt;<i> systems
</I>&gt;<i> nor within the rootfs.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, I could log into any of the other root file systems
</I>&gt;<i> or log directly into the rootfs and deal with the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> As I previously mentioned it is very groovy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Multiple root file systems and control groups are a perfect compliment
</I>&gt;<i> and are both examples of some of the most innovative technology that
</I>&gt;<i> Linux kernel hackers have provided.
</I>&gt;<i> Control groups provide a method for resource delegation that is far
</I>&gt;<i> superior
</I>&gt;<i> to POSIX and UNIX specified methods.
</I>&gt;<i> However, control groups is very Linux specific.
</I>&gt;<i> Only those who run a Linux kernel gain the benefit of control groups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> UNIX seems to always have been designed as a multi-user operating system.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it might never have been designed
</I>&gt;<i> to be a multi-root file system operating system.
</I>&gt;<i> Running multiple root file systems was far from impossible.
</I>&gt;<i> However, complications previously existed.
</I>&gt;<i> The introduction of unshared namespace and VETHs circumvented
</I>&gt;<i> those problems and made multiple root file systems viable.
</I>&gt;<i> Again this is functionality provided exclusively on Linux
</I>&gt;<i> by those clever Linux kernel hackers.
</I>&gt;<i> The only credit that I can take is for redesigning the init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> to become compatible with a multi-root deployment.
</I>&gt;<i> Any Linux based POSIX should be able to provide multiple-root file system
</I>&gt;<i> support
</I>&gt;<i> if the maintainers provide compatible init-scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> But it might not gain popularity when HVMs and PVs can be created instead
</I>&gt;<i> that can run fine without revision and testing of init-scripts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In a 3 way comparison between
</I>&gt;<i> user mode Linux, HVMs + PVs, and multiple root file systems;
</I>&gt;<i> my preference became multiple root file systems.
</I>&gt;<i> I admit that it required an embarrassingly long amount of time and effort
</I>&gt;<i> for me to hone the init-scripts into adequate shape for the task.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet I am not displeased for having the convenience.
</I>&gt;<i> When considering the benefits of GPT + control groups + VETH + unshared
</I>&gt;<i> namespace
</I>&gt;<i> it all points in the direction of providing multiple root file systems.
</I>&gt;<i> I felt eager to give it a try during 2012 even before unshared name space.
</I>&gt;<i> I felt very certain that 2013 would be the year that Modern Magic gains
</I>&gt;<i> support for multiple root file systems.
</I>&gt;<i> And I made it happen, however, I required nearly half the year
</I>&gt;<i> to prepare everything satisfactorily for the 2013 I/R and the 2013 Modern
</I>&gt;<i> Magic.
</I>&gt;<i> And now everyone can enjoy it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in summary, the new 2013 I/Rs were released about a month ago.
</I>&gt;<i> It is called &quot;Modern Magic.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> And due to the improved support for SMP
</I>&gt;<i> and support for multi-root file systems it is definitely modern.
</I>&gt;<i> Deployment can be accomplished by anyone
</I>&gt;<i> who can follow the suggestions provided by the deployment docent.
</I>&gt;<i> And the experience is more of a read and learn as necessary
</I>&gt;<i> to accomplish each step of deployment
</I>&gt;<i> rather than read a 1000 page document the night before before booting the
</I>&gt;<i> I/R.
</I>&gt;<i> Please feel invited to send feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> If the experience is less than adequate
</I>&gt;<i> then definitely provide feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> All feedback is accumulated and eventually acted upon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fact that &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; was tried and the discontinued
</I>&gt;<i> goes to show that feedback shapes the evolution of this POSIX.
</I>&gt;<i> That which achieves outcomes that are incommensurate with intention
</I>&gt;<i> become discontinued in order to direct effort towards sub-projects
</I>&gt;<i> that provide more benefit.
</I>&gt;<i> And everyone is learning and occasionally making mistakes,
</I>&gt;<i> myself include even after providing this POSIX for more than a decade.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, nobody should feel as if successful deployment
</I>&gt;<i> should be achieved as the outcome of the first adventure
</I>&gt;<i> with the deployment docent.
</I>&gt;<i> Failure often teaches more than success.
</I>&gt;<i> And the deployment docent is not a pathetic test for a classroom course
</I>&gt;<i> or at least nobody should use it for that purpose.
</I>&gt;<i> It is intended as an instructional aid so that those who possess SA
</I>&gt;<i> potential
</I>&gt;<i> but not yet acquired SA lore can be directed towards documentation
</I>&gt;<i> that will provide information relevant for the current task.
</I>&gt;<i> It is a form of computer based training
</I>&gt;<i> that is integrated directly into the process of deployment.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, it will become a positive experience for potential SAs
</I>&gt;<i> and a useful aid for experienced SAs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S.
</I>&gt;<i> Although what follows is merely my opinion I enjoy using the deployment
</I>&gt;<i> docent.
</I>&gt;<i> One of the steps is for testing ALSA audio by playing some ogg files
</I>&gt;<i> using the mocp command line audio playing client/daemon program.
</I>&gt;<i> Listening to the music should provide a nice tangible reward that
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrates
</I>&gt;<i> that skill is being acquired and applied towards the goal of successful
</I>&gt;<i> deployment.
</I>&gt;<i> The amount of steps for achieving deployment is long; so long that I lost
</I>&gt;<i> count.
</I>&gt;<i> I can hop through them all in about 10 minutes or less, perhaps 5 minutes
</I>&gt;<i> or less.
</I>&gt;<i> Although I am not reading documentation,
</I>&gt;<i> the process of going through each step
</I>&gt;<i> helps ensure that I do not accidentally
</I>&gt;<i> omit doing something essential for achieving successful deployment.
</I>&gt;<i> The process of deployment could be an intense adventure for neophytes.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, I am hoping that the musical interlude helps sustain interest
</I>&gt;<i> and a positive feeling that progress is being accomplished.
</I>&gt;<i> The experience is not as hard-core as I made it sound in the message,
</I>&gt;<i> but is also intended to provide amusement.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, in the future I will be able to provide definitions for more
</I>&gt;<i> argot.
</I>&gt;<i> For now I hope SAs and potentials are able to achieve deployment
</I>&gt;<i> without having unfamiliar argot create insurmountable confusion and
</I>&gt;<i> disinterest.
