<PRE>Due to change in internals variables in sorcery
the script that rolls the catalog failed.
Should be fixed already.

Yesterday, I was checking to see if lighttpd could serve files
over the same connection faster than httpd.
It did not.

Perhaps the one aspect that I liked most about
the current catalog distribution method
was that it avoided sending a complete list of cataloged spells.
However, that was the single aspect that Evert loathed the most.
Thanks to considerable feedback and constructive criticism
we will now be trying the catalog system
that is designed and implemented according to Evert's suggestions.

I designed and implemented the new system.
It should be closer to what Evert desired.
Much of that conversation was probably off the email list.
It spanned many messages.
However, I wanted to make proper mention of that for two reasons.
First, if it seems better or performs better
then thank Evert for contributing his ideas and feedback.
Second, I only changed the catalog update method once
on my whim this year.
This unprecedented second time is because the implementation
of Evert's suggestions seems to have sufficient merit.

If cups printing is working again after mysteriously not working
then thank Evert for investigating and discovering that important
components had been removed from the cups' software project tarball
and are now provided in separate tarballs such as cups-filters.
I had my eyes on so many other aspects
that I failed to notice and read the relevant information
until after Evert investigated and reported it.

Evert did not expect to be credited and thanked for that
since it is typical Evert style of contribution,
but I felt very pleased to be able to delegate the cups situation
and feel fully confident that Evert would discover the solution.

If email was not silent I would suggest applause for Evert,
because he is a consistent contributor of feed back, bug reports, etc..
Thanks to Evert the quality of this POSIX is sustained.

Right, now back to the description of new changes.
I will attempt a succinct explanation along with the logic.
First of all I granted the complete list of cataloged spells.
Naturally, that would combined each spell's most recent date
to determine if a previously downloaded spell should be downloaded again.
However, the list of spells and list of edits are two separate files.
The reason for that is the reduction of bytes downloaded.
The list of spells only changed when I add a new spell
or remove an existing spell.
Far more frequently I edit existing spells.
Therefore, the list of spells should only be downloaded
when the remote copy is newer than the local.
That huge list of spells requires 14K to download.
But it should not download often.

The list of edits for spell is the traditional YYYYMMDD format.
It is a 4.3K download.
Combined both files can download in approximately
4 seconds on a 56.6 kilobaud analog modem.
Not bad at all.

After a sorcery acquires current copies of both files
then it can compare with the local catalog to determine
what spells require downloading.
Spells are stored in individual tarballs.
However, most updates will not require
downloading more than a fraction
of the total spells hosted.
Thanks to a recent adjustment
a complete list of spells requires approximately
3000 files downloaded.

Note that the FlightGear-Aircraft spell has soaked up
and can now dynamically provide the sources for
all the previous FlightGear-Aircraft-* type spells.
It mitigated a few hundred spells.
But those who find simulating stimulating
can still acquire the same aircraft by configuring
and casting FlightGear-Aircraft
Please pardon the digression.

Because the spells are individually tarred
the rate of download is independent of total bandwidth.
Due to the 4 packet exchange before any file is transferred
latency mitigates throughput.
In my situation that latency looked significant.
So to combat the latency I adjusted the download method
to permit multiple concurrent connections with the server
when downloading a large amount of spells.
As many as 4 concurrent connections can be established.
Each connection will download 256 spells.
That mitigates the lengthy TCP connection handshaking.
However, that said downloading about 3000 files
still requires duration in proportion with latency.
It might seem brutal to anyone bouncing packets off of satellites.
Sorry for that.

Best case scenario...
While attempting to update the catalog
the heads for the name and edit files are downloaded.
The remote copies are not newer.
And the update is complete.
Nothing else is downloaded.
Downloading 2 headers is practically no expense
for checking to see if updates are available.

Frequent updater scenario...
The head for the names list is checked and it matches.
The edit list's head shows a newer file and so the 4.3K
edit file is downloaded.
Then about 40 spell tarballs are downloaded.
They are reasonably small and the total transfer requires
less than 64 kilobytes of download.
Not bad, not bad, right?

And the less frequent scenario.
The 14K name list + 4.3K edit list are downloaded.
Then about 300 to 400 spells download.
Total transfer size is less than 256K.

While less efficient than sdelta3 update patches
the method still offers significant savings
as opposed to downloading a full catalog tarball on each update.
And the preparation of the name and edit lists
and the spell tarballs utilizes minimum processing power.
This method requires each client computer's sorcery
to decided which spell files should be downloaded.
Those are admirable boons.

The obvious bane is the additional strain on the web server.
Due to latency open connections remain open longer.
I am not anticipating a problem.
However, the server can only maintain
a limited amount of concurrent connections.
Those limits can probably be increased if a problem occurs.

In retrospect I feel better about this new method.
I dare say I feel a bit excited about it.
It's implementation is excitingly simple and eloquent.

At first I loathed the idea of providing a list of spells
and even a list of edit dates.
However, since they only download when newer
that small change helps drastically mitigate
the amount of bandwidth utilized.
So it is almost as good as a boon without a commensurate bane.

I remember days long gone, more than a decade ago
when Redhat had no update method.
SAs eyeballed a ftp directory containing RPMS
and manually downloaded that which was not already installed.
Granted user worms nearly an unlimited amount of time
to execute exploits in order to gain root access.
Was a good enough reason to quit using Redhat.

And I remember Debian with it's massive package list.
It was either completely downloaded or rsynced.
It was something like a 2 megabyte file.
Checking for updates was NOT fast,
especially slow on analog modems.
So that was a potential 2 megabytes download
prior to downloading any newer pre-compiled binary packages.

When I contrast this new method with ancient methods
I experienced with other POSIX
then I feel like saying a transfer of a few kilobytes
seems delightfully eloquent in contrast.
Perhaps we shall all come to appreciate it 2014.
The method should be available in a day or two
early November 2013.
Remember to update.
The older two methods for catalog acquisition
become deprecated immediately upon the release
of a new I/R in 2014.
Any root file systems left behind in 2014 must update
installed sorcery first merely to acquire a newer catalog.


Technical explanation exists below.
If not interested in knowing how it all fits together
then consider this the end of message.


Edits was briefly described before as YYYMMDD dates.
More to explain yet exists.

Edits are not this POSIX's specific versions for spells.
They literally are a method for dating spell
that allows for me to locate spells more easily.
edit dates are right there at the top of spell files.
3 types exist.

info info last 20131031

The above indicates that the most recent release of a stable source
was 20131031.
When I do date subtraction by subtracting this date from the current date
then I can determine the duration since a new release.
If I am wondering if a software project died or
is escaping my automatic surveillance then this date grants a clue.

with info good 20131029

The above date indicates that I manually checked for a newer version
and then re-cast the existing version on 20131029 and verified that
it still compiles, links, and installs fine.
I prefer that software projects release new source tarballs
approximately once every 6 months.
If I do not see it happening
then I tend to visit their webpages and probe.
Did the software project's webpage relocate?
Did the download URL change?
If something important changes then I find it.
Due to the amount of effort involved
I can only chase potentially inactive software projects
approximately once every 6 months.
However, most new releases of source tarballs
become checked into the software catalog within a week
after the software author makes the release.
Therefore, stale spells become the exception rather than the norm.

with info edit 20130704

The above line indicates when a spell was merely edited.
Sometimes I make a cosmetic change to a spell.
Sometimes it might be a bug fix.
For whatever reason I edit it.
That above line reminds me of when I did it.
But it alone does not tell me what I did.
But it alone is good enough to indicate that
any downloaded spell with a different date
must be downloaded again to receive the freshly edited spell.

Some spells will have both a
with info last
with info good
lines.
The most recent date counts.
Some spells might have all 3 lines.
Still the most recent date counts.

I have been dating spells since perhaps sometime in 2012.
I forgot exactly when I began dating spells.
I began when I realized that I could display
the information color coded in the HTML catalog listing
that I generate periodically.
It assists with the task of locating newer source tarballs
without actually manually visiting 3000+ websites with a web browser.

The idea of dating spells was suggested by someone
perhaps nearly a decade before.
The recommendation lacked the suggestion of using
different types of date labels such as &quot;last&quot; &quot;good&quot; and &quot;edit.&quot;
The recommendation lacked specifying date in YYYYMMDD format.

The conversation ended with something like,
&quot;look at the date on svn's commit log for the spell.&quot;
At that time no implementation was made from the recommendation,
because no sufficient reason was stated
for why the effort would gain more than it costs.

While I want to offer credit where credit is due
the suggestion for the use of a date field in spells
is no more related to my implementation
than the content of every file is related
to idea of a &quot;file&quot; or a &quot;file name.&quot;
Naturally, we can not extend the copyright
for every files' content to the person who coined
the word &quot;file&quot; or &quot;file name.&quot;

However, I wanted to blow on that old ember
to provide a reminder that I try to remember
every suggestion and discussion and eventually
utilize the information beneficially even when
nothing immediately comes from from it.

Please be specific and elaborate on the benefit
and the utilization of the idea when making suggestions.
Since plenty more exists than can be accomplished
new implementations become only when an evaluation
of their boons outweigh their banes.

Thanks for reading the entire message.
And thanks again to Evert for solid feedback.
Originally, I did not want a method that involved
transferring a list of spells.
But as I explained above,
only transferring the list when it changes
it a good compromise.
We can all feel pleased and excited
that this POSIX continues to evolve.
