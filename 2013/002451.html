<PRE>First of all, destroy the 2012 I/Rs.
Yes, take the CD firmly in hand and now push down on both sides until
it snaps apart through the center.
Now toss the broken hull of that CD into the waste can.
That is the first step of a successful deployment.

I already removed many of the necessary functions for transitioning
from a 2012 style deployment to a 2013 style deployment.
So it will not work.
Why will it not work.
It will not work because I spent 6 ****ing months working intensely
on creating a 2013 I/R to use so that people could enjoy all the awesome
benefits of 2013 Modern Magic and so that nobody would be installing using
the 2012 I/R.
However, if my solid effort is insufficient reason
then please consider this one simple fact.
The 2012 I/R does not provide a GPT aware Linux kernel
and it does not provide tools for deployment onto GPT partitioned disk.
However, the 2013 I/R provides a GPT aware Linux kernel.
The 2013 I/R provides the tools from the gptfdisk software project
that is used for deployment onto disks with GUID Partition Tables.

/sbin/cgdisk
/sbin/fixparts
/sbin/gdisk
/sbin/sgdisk
/usr/share/man/man8/cgdisk.8.xz
/usr/share/man/man8/fixparts.8.xz
/usr/share/man/man8/gdisk.8.xz
/usr/share/man/man8/sgdisk.8.xz

So in response to Evert's suggesting of using cfdisk...
I would say do NOT use cfdisk.
cfdisk is for legacy partition tables.
A similar utility provided by the gptfdisk software project is called
cgdisk.
I recommend using gdisk.
I have not used cgdisk.

The 2013 I/R should say something like Sorcerer Modern Magic  lots of
spaces and then Installation Docent.

It probably aught to say deployment docent, because is what I call it, but
I omitted rephrasing some of the more obvious text and instead concentrating
on making good documentation for it.
It recognizes certain commands.

The argot command suggests vocabulary that is essential to understand
for successful completion of the current step.
The ask command will provide definition for the argot that which is
provided.
The docs command suggests documentation to read.
The hint command provides a hint relevant to successful completion of the
current step.
The test command will perform tests and give recommendations if the step
has a test encoded for it.
The fore command advances to the next step.
The yore command reverts to the previous step.

The shell prompt is fully functional.
The deployment docent is integrated into the shell.

Try typing docs and pressing enter.
It should provide something that looks like:

man less                               # learn to use the pager program
less /usr/doc/docent/intro             # please read the introduction
man man                                # learn to read manual pages
man xz                                 # learn to decompress documents
man bash                               # learn to wield the shell
xz -cd /usr/share/tldp/\
Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO.xz | less   # learn to wield virtual consoles

Then type man less and press enter.
And that will provide instruction about how to use the pager program.
The next suggested command is
less /usr/doc/docent/intro

Running that command provides a verbose description of the docent
recognized commands.
&gt;<i>From that point forward the remainder should be easy.
</I>Just read documentations.
The entire first step is reading documentation.
After that enter fore to advance to the next step.
Eventually, after completing a some steps involving reading documentation
planning will be introduced and the SA will select and modify a plan for
deployment.

The goal is not merely to achieve deployment.
I could do that with nobody sitting at the keyboard if that was what I
wanted.
Just have it slap down the POSIX on /dev/sda1
and obliterate anything else in the way if I so desired.
But that would be stupid.
So instead the goal is for the deployment docent to help the person at the
keyboard
learn and master the lore required for achieving successful deployment.
Then after a few successful deployments are achieved the SA
should have gained sufficient lore in order to create one's own
script based mass deployment method if multiple boxes require deployment.

In summary...
Snap the 2012 I/R into two pieces then drop into trash can.
Second, boot the 2013 I/R.
Third, follow the documentations provided for each step.
Finally, enjoy an awesome fully deployed Modern Magic 2013.
So in short order: snap; read; follow; enjoy.  :)

P.S.
I apologize if I seem to be berating anyone.
I am not.
The deployment docent for the 2013 I/R is very nifty
and anyone who has not tried it might not be able to imagine it.
And if it seems confusing that is because it is not there to anything
for the person at the keyboard unless the person at the keyboard requests
it.
Instead it is the same as an ordinary root shell prompt
with a few lines of additional clutter printed on the screen.
If a person merely sits and waits then the deployment docent will do
absolute nothing.
It will not offer a menu.
It will not pop up a window asking if a suggestion is required.
Instead it exercises infinite patience.
My goal is not to create a 5 minute deployment
like the types of deployments I achieve during tests.
The goal is for the person at the keyboard to feel
invited to leisurely learn everything involved in deployment
without creating any sense of urgency.
That is why I say relax and if necessary just sit there for a while
and consider the possibilities.
If achieving successful deployment requires most of the weekend
then that would be 2 days of quality learning.

If the SA has the skills then a 5 minute deployment is possible.
If a neophyte is enjoying their first deployment experience
then an entire week of daily effort might be required.
Both outcomes are equally desirable.
Therefore, I urge to each person granting the patience required to learn
the lore.
Those who do not want to become SAs
those who do not want to to become
sorcerers that wield the modern magic;
can always use one of the gazillion noob niche POSIX.
I am fine with that outcome.
I am not trying to please everyone.

BTW, I have at times considered making a video of me doing the deployment
docent.
However, I would type commands so quickly and skip so much of the
documentation
that people watching the video would probably gain no idea of what happened
or what I did.
For someone at my skill level;
following the steps of the deployment docent
only helps ensure that I do not omit execution of a command
that is essential for achieving deployment.
That is because I already have all of the commands memorized
from having done the deployment docent time and time again.

What would be beneficial is a video of deployment to a virtual machine
using the deployment docent made by someone who is still fresh;
such as someone who has not used the deployment docent
yet has all the skill required to make a screen capture video.
If I do it someone will expect that I made a 15 minute long video
and time compressed it to 3 minutes long.
I type that fast.
And when I deploy to a virtual machine I have no worry about making a
mistake
since it can not obliterate the real fixed disks of the computer.
My typing speed was probably already evident from the verbose email
messages I write.
People probably expect I spend all day doing email,
when I can type out a message like this in only a few minutes.

Probably most people would offer the closing cliche of &quot;good luck.&quot;
However, in this scenario only good tenacity is required.
Therefore;
Good tenacity.  :)

</I>&gt;<i> If any uncertainty exists about which disk to deploy on
</I>&gt;<i> then run gdisk and examine the partition table.
</I>&gt;<i> Partitions are typically granted different codes that
</I>&gt;<i> describe either the operating system installed or the use of the partition.
</I>&gt;<i> Another possibility is to try...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> file -s /dev/sd*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Allow the file command to a bit from each partition and device
</I>&gt;<i> and report what is conjectured to be the use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, if gdisk is run on the 80G disk and the 300G disk
</I>&gt;<i> Then the total space reported for each disk will differ.
</I>&gt;<i> And the larger disk would be the 300G disk of course.
</I>&gt;<i> If confusion still exists remember to remove any removable USB SSD
</I>&gt;<i> because those also can be assigned devices by udev.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Discover what is where on disks is usually an easily accomplished task.
</I>&gt;<i> So of course remember to make backups before beginning because
</I>&gt;<i> often mistakes can not be corrected.
</I>&gt;<i> More than a decade ago I obliterated a partition with an operating system
</I>&gt;<i> installed
</I>&gt;<i> that I mainly only kept in order to be able to flash the BIOS of the
</I>&gt;<i> mother board
</I>&gt;<i> and other hardware's firmware to newer versions.
</I>&gt;<i> But I did not merely delete the partition.
</I>&gt;<i> I accidentally installed a test I/R on to it.
</I>&gt;<i> And so it was totally gone.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I only felt irritated for a moment,
</I>&gt;<i> because I never had further use for that old operating system.
</I>&gt;<i> RIP.
</I>&gt;<i> So with that said, do backups and save the data someplace safe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Go through the deployment docent slowly,
</I>&gt;<i> enjoy reading the documentation,
</I>&gt;<i> relax and expect to be at it for a while.
</I>&gt;<i> That way no sense of urgency or feeling of impatience
</I>&gt;<i> can become cause for making a mistake.
</I>&gt;<i> The guidance from the deployment docent can provide
</I>&gt;<i> a considerable amount to learn
</I>&gt;<i> if the person at the keyboard wants to allocate the time
</I>&gt;<i> to soak up all that good information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The deployment docent alone is at least as good as
</I>&gt;<i> computer based training program that costs thousands
</I>&gt;<i> of dollars for a site license.
</I>&gt;<i> And even better than having it print dumb-arse certificates of
</I>&gt;<i> accomplishment
</I>&gt;<i> for learning trivial stuff like how to write a crontab entry
</I>&gt;<i> the end result is achieving deployment of a fancy powerful operating
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i> And that is way better than paper and trophies because an operating system
</I>&gt;<i> runs software and we all enjoy running software, right.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I previously mentioned the goal is no longer to create an easy
</I>&gt;<i> no questions asked deployment.
</I>&gt;<i> I already accomplished that with a previous I/R.
</I>&gt;<i> And people who did it learned nothing and continued to learn nothing.
</I>&gt;<i> The only way people will learn is if they must type some commands,
</I>&gt;<i> understand what those commands accomplish,
</I>&gt;<i> and have read some documentation about those commands.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It can be fun.
</I>&gt;<i> Remember that all the tools required to accomplish the task
</I>&gt;<i> and even more than that are available the moment it the I/R completes
</I>&gt;<i> booting.
</I>&gt;<i> From that point onward successful deployment is achieved
</I>&gt;<i> by the skill and tenacity of the person at the keyboard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would not create an impossible to deploy POSIX.
</I>&gt;<i> Doing so would be foolishness and useless for everyone.
</I>&gt;<i> So never yield to frustration or confusion.
</I>&gt;<i> A successful outcome is possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I so much wanted for the success of the person at the keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> that I created the deployment docent that recommends documentation to read
</I>&gt;<i> and provides a step by step guide to achieving a successful deployment,
</I>&gt;<i> and provides definition for unfamiliar argot.
</I>&gt;<i> It is almost like the virtual &quot;me&quot; standing behind looking over the
</I>&gt;<i> shoulder
</I>&gt;<i> willing to provide immediate assistance.
</I>&gt;<i> That is plenty groovy is it not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion is to relax, learn, enjoy.
</I>&gt;<i> It has all the tools from util-linux e2fsprogs and coreutils.
</I>&gt;<i> With utilities such as the file command and plenty more;
</I>&gt;<i> deployment is like driving a F22 aircraft 4 block to the grocery store.
</I>&gt;<i> It's powerful, impressive, and not stripped down.
</I>&gt;<i> Deploy it to disk and it will fly high, fast, stealthy and
</I>&gt;<i> be capable of completing almost any role designated.
