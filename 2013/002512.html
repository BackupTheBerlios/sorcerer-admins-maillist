&gt;<i> Hi all!
</I>&gt;<i> well I'm far behind sorcery usage since it runs on a home server for years

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That is mostly how name changes are done.
# augur scry -&gt; # aurum survey
I merely type # au su${TAB}
and tab completion completes survey
since survey is moderately difficult to type.

All the queue names and task delegated utilities
have simple 4 letter English words.

The choice to name the toolset EruditeTechnic
comes from the meaning of Erudite.
Technic is easier to type than technique.
Both words have the same amount of characters
which makes makes for easier creation of a logo
if I desire to give it it's own website.
Erudite is an uncommon word.
However, the toolset itself is uncommon.  :)


&gt;<i> for example ifconfig became ip.... so I think that cast shall become
</I>&gt;<i> something like compile, augur shall become something like software or
</I>&gt;<i> soft_manager.... well something that some *neewbee* shall find without
</I>&gt;<i> knowing latain... ;)
</I>&gt;<i> JL

*chuckles*

Knowing Latin will not help with knowing the name of program.
Might help with remembering it.
If I did not previously mentioned the new name is something of a pun.
The previously alias to augur was au.
Many of us type au instead of augur.
Therefore, to keep transition easy
the au alias was maintained.
And since Au is the symbol for the element aurum
on the periodic table of elements;
the name of the utility became aurum.
If wondering why not gold,
that is because gold was selected as the name
for binutils linker program written in C++

aurum is not a bad choice of words for the utility.
The utility itself has considerable mass,
is not hard, is malleable, and considered valuable.
Those are also some of the characteristics shared
by the element aurum.

However, consider the names for package managers programs for a moment.
What comes to mind?  rpm?  dpkg?  yast?  portage?
Is aurum more difficult than than augur?
Same amount of characters, 2 of 5 differ.
It simply ends obsolete nomenclature without
making a drastic change.

Some may feel that their fingers are overly conditioned to type augur.
If so the SA can temporarily create an alias until accustomed
to typing au or aurum.

When each decent POSIX has it's own name for software administration tools
nothing can be assumed about what it will be called.
The best that can be hoped for is the selection of a name
that is easily typed.
With the variety of programs names that begin with the word auto;
and especially the /usr/bin/aurecord program
the possibility for tab completion of au to aurum is inconvenient.
Between 3 and 4 characters of the name must be typed before
pressing tab which brings the total to 4 or 5 which is nearly
tantamount to typing the entire word.
However, the au alias allows the SA to type au and then
begin typing the parameter and press tab to tab complete
parameters for au as if au were an installed program
which it is merely an alias for aurum.
That is some convenience.

I suppose I could have renamed the program to au,
however I anticipated less of a problem using aurum.
Multiple concerns were expressed that the program
should have an entirely different name.
Probably the flip side of that coin is if I had done that
I would have received concerns that some similarity
or backward compatibility should have been maintained.
I anticipated that not everyone would be pleased about the change.
However, I make hundreds of changes that are pleasing
to SAs even if SAs remain unaware about or without expressed opinion.
Even if a small change feels like a splinter at first it soon becomes
forgotten.
