/+/base/etc/rootfs/fstab

So when in the base root file system the file is
/etc/rootfs/fstab

During the sysinit phase
files in /etc/rootfs/ are copied into /etc/
Therefore, after booting the file
/etc/rootfs/fstab /etc/fstab are the same;
but only on the rootfs.
in /+/base/
the files never merge because
sysinit only happens on rootfs.

 &gt; Files that should be available in /etc/ when on the rootfs should be
&gt;<i> within
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; /etc/rootfs/
</I>&gt;<i> Is that a literal rootfs, or does that name change with each root?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
/+/base/etc/rootfs/
should exist if the cpio initramfs images are generated from
/+/base/
The other root file systems do not require /etc/rootfs/
because they do not generate files used to construct initramfs images.
If they do then fixing that by entering a root file system
such as
/+/work/
and
# rm -fr /lib/modules /lib/firmware /boot
Then
# au merge; au queue reap/linux-{firmware,kernel,modules} reap/firmware;
reap

My /+/work/
and /+/play/
and /+/test/
root file systems no longer create initramfs images.
Therefore, during updates linux-modules linux-kernel do not moil.
It would become wasted processor cycles and wasted disk space.

/+/base/ requires it's own /etc/fstab/ directory
and /lib/modules and /lib/firmware and /boot/
because all of that is used to generate the cpio initramfs images
that are used to populate the rootfs.



&gt;<i> eg, say we use /etc/fstab and have the following entries:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/sda1          /+/base   auto defaults 0 0
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/sda1          /+/64       auto defaults 0 0
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/sda1          /+/32       auto defaults 0 0
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/sda1          /+/test     auto defaults 0 0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do I need corresponding /etc/base, /etc/64 /etc/32 and /etc/test on
</I>&gt;<i> the base rootfs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The example seems incorrect.
But if I understand the question properly
then the answer is that /etc/rootfs/ is only required
on the root file system used to create the cpio initramfs images
that are used to populate the rootfs before sysinit begins.
However, if all root file systems have /etc/rootfs/
then that will not cause harm.
It only becomes cause for confusion.

/etc/rootfs/ allows for the rootfs file system to have it's own
/etc/passwd /etc/shadow /etc/group /etc/fstab and so forth.
Those files exist in /etc/rootfs/ and are copied into /etc/
during sysinit when the file system is identified as rootfs.
/+/base/ is it's own root file system.
Therefore /+/base/ probably requires it's own
/etc/{passwd,shadow,group,fstab}
Therefore, rather than placing that in a subdirectory
those files own their original locations.

My first solution for the overlapping file names
was to suggest /etc/fstab.rootfs
And while that idea may be easier to understand,
it becomes less easy to manage than an /etc/rootfs/ directory.
If I
# cd /etc/rootfs/
Then I can begin editing files within that directory
# nano *
And I know that I will not accidentally be editing files
that are used on the /+/base/ root file system.
Or I can type
# nano /etc/rootfs/*
while logged into /+/base/
and merrily edit files.

After decades of typing something like
# nano fstab
# pico fstab
# vi fstab

The tendency to press enter is difficult to circumvent
when intending to edit the fstab.rootfs
Therefore, discarding the .rootfs and going with the rootfs directory
seemed a more prudent change.

And if I had gone that way from the start
then the implementation would be more efficient.
However, oops, hindsight is 20/20.

One cause for confusion is the concept that with one
root file system two fstab files can exist.
Which is used for which?
Hopefully the docent helps explain that.
However, package based SAs must still grasp the idea
that this thing called a &quot;rootfs&quot; exists
and is similar yet not a root file system.
That much creates cause for confusion.


Or, does each rootfs as defined in /etc/fstab have it's own /etc/rootfs?
&gt;<i>
</I>
rootfs != root file system.
Please spot and correct that point of confusion.
rootfs is the special hybrid RAMFS + TMPFS mounted on /
where the content of the cpio files is extracted by the kernel.
rootfs is not backed by a device.
rootfs does not survive reboot.
rootfs is not updated directly like a root file system.
However, the SA can log into rootfs and gain an
omniscient view of every process running regardless
of whether the process is on the rootfs or a root file system.
root file systems are mounted off of immediate subdirectories of /+/
root file systems are ?chrooted? into,
but it is not exactly a chroot because
it involves transition into several unshared name spaces.
In contrast the rootfs has no unshared name spaces.

Okay, that much ends the description.
However, for a glimps of much earlier thoughts...
at a time long ago I expected the increased RAM loadout
of computers would eventually allow for a design where
the majority of processes run from the rootfs,
while the disk based root file system would be entered into
merely for the purpose of updating.
Some people do something similar to that these days.
They back the root file system with a SSD.
And /home/ and other storage devices are backed by magnetic media.
In that fashion excellent performance can be achieved
since latency is not introduced by drive head movement
since SSD lack moving parts.

My desire for multiple root file systems was realized first.
And price for system RAM did not drop as much as I wanted.
However, to some extent the rootfs must be utilized for more tasks
At least for the purpose of networking the rootfs must act like
a combination firewall/router.
That is because the actual ethernet device can not exist
in multiple root file systems without abandoning unshared net namespace.
Abandon unshared net namespace then only one of the sshd
in multiple root file systems can listen on port 22
and the others must listen on different ports.
The unshared net namespace was the missing link
or one of the most critical components involved
in quenching my desire for multiple root file systems.
Now multiple root file systems can each receive their own IP address
and have their services bind to default ports.
That maintains simplicity.
However, the use of VETH and the network configuration
that must happen within the rootfs introduces complexity.
As they cliche insists, &quot;An omelet can not be made without cracking eggs.&quot;
Or in this case the convenience of one costs the complexity of the other.

A near infinite arbitrary amount of possible configurations exist.
I feel most pleased by the one that I provide.
But it forces the realization of a single computer
being more like a lab of computers.
And given a single computer's available resources
that analogy is not far from true even if the computer
does not have 12 keyboards and 12 monitors attached.

That might beg the question could a single computer be provided
that has 32 root file systems and have attached something like
30 monitors, 30 keyboard, 30 mice.
The answer to that is; it is nearly possible.
Attaching the 30 monitors is iffy.
It somewhat depends upon being able to install 16 graphic cards/devices.
However, USB attached graphic devices now exist.
I would not expect ideal performance from USB devices.
If someone was eager to make it happen
then yes a single computer could probably provide for a lab of 30
if it was running my POSIX.
And it could be more powerful than
a lab of 30 computers provided 2 decades before.

The concept is not at all new.
I saw a lab of thin clients on an Apple Corvis network or something like
that.
It was many years ago.
Hmm, I remember each computer had it's own base and floppy disk.
And that files could also be saved in limited area of space
on the fixed disk attached to the master computer for the network.
And it probably communicated using token ring technology,
because concurrent file access with others was exceedingly slow.
However, in my previous example I imagined a lab
where the 30 stations consisted of nothing more than
a mouse, keyboard, and display.
And it differs from a design where a single computer's display
is multiplexed to several different displays.
A design that utilizes multiple root file systems
can make each station feel exactly like it's own computer.

That much said should convey an idea of the potential,
but not necessarily the intended utilization.
Making each group of ( pointer, keyboard, display )
devices associate with the proper X server seems
too great a challenge.
An attached USB port might vary from boot to boot.
Therefore, the devices must have a uniq identifier.
All network devices are supposed to have a unique identifier.
It is called the MAC, or machine address.
MAC differs from IP address.
And if I remember correctly MAC is used at layer 2 of networking
for identifying where packets go.

What is stored in /etc/rootfs? just fstab, a whole copy of /etc plus
&gt;<i> subdirs or just the files that need changing in /etc/
</I>&gt;<i> for each rootfs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Only one &quot;rootfs&quot; exists.
/etc/rootfs/ stores the files that should go into /etc/ for the rootfs.
/etc/rootfs/ should contain only the files that would differ
from those that already exist in /etc/
Therefore, if /etc/hosts suffices
then /etc/rootfs/hosts is not required.


 &gt; After the rootfs fstab file is installed in /etc/rootfs/fstab
&gt;<i> &gt; then it can be easily sedited with the command
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; # sed -i 's:/media/root/:/+/:' /etc/rootfs/fstab
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But probably better to edit with nano
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if not comfortable using sed.
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, so the mountpoints are not relative to each chroot?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
?
I did not understand the question.

/+/base/etc/rootfs/ should exist.
/+/*/etc/rootfs/ exists if the SA did not bother removing
/etc/rootfs/ before copying the rootfs to other root file systems
during deployment using the deployment docent.

Please do not mistake my response as me being irritated.
I am not irritated.
I perceive a misunderstanding concerning the word &quot;rootfs.&quot;
If I ever use the &quot;rootfs&quot; where I should have typed root file system
then I wrote a typo.
&quot;Rootfs&quot; is the concept of the absolute /, never unmounted,
never backed by a device, and created by the kernel.
It has existed for as long as I recollect Linux.
It was occluded from view when booting with a monolithic kernel,
because the kernel was instructed to mount a specific
disk based file system on /
The kernel documentation refers to rootfs as rootfs.
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt
That may become cause for confusion with the word root file systems.
Yet, if I deviate from kernel hacker's given terminology
then I create another barrier to understanding
rather than demystifying the concepts.
Hmm, the deployment docent does not reference that document.
I added to my todo list to add a reference to that to the deployment docent.
One look at that and misunderstanding should evaporate.

I added to my todo list to make an entire step dedicated
to explaining rootfs.
11 of the documents I wrote contain rootfs.
But it could become cause for confusion if not fully demystified.
I could easily miss something like that,
because of my excessive experience.

Thanks for giving me a clue about that.
Maybe I might spend today on the docent.
I have plenty on my todo list,
but I have yet to start doing any of it.  :)
