<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>More often the norm is for me to not discuss changes that I am planning or
implementing
until they are ready to be unleashed.
Otherwise discussion might include only the individuals involved in the
sub-project.
The main reason for this is to avoid vaporware
and being able to humbly back out of ideas that seemed awesome at first,
but then evaluated differently after test implementations.
However, this time I will make an exception, and being open discussion
and requests for opinion about a current sub-project.

Brace for impact.
The I/R menu driven installer is deprecated.
And Sorcerer Sentient will be entirely deprecated.
And I am discarding that sat quiz thing,
which for some may seem more tedious
and insulting than helpful.

The menu driven installer was convenient.
Sorcerer Sentient probably was little more
than a worthless display of my arrogance.
Neither helps a SA become more skilled.
Neither are worth keeping.

What I have envisioned and coded and which is nearly complete is a docent.
I call it a docent to avoid any confusion with an &quot;installation wizard.&quot;
It is not an &quot;installation wizard&quot; by another name, not at all.
An installation wizard would provide chronological steps where questions
are asked
and then tasks are automatically performed by the wizard program.
The docent differs.

The docent still guides the person at the keyboard step by step.
The docent provides information such as the location
of documentation that is relevant to the goals of the current step.
The person at the keyboard is responsible for learning and deciding
the commands to type at the command prompt.
Therefore, at the step involving creating file systems
then the SA would read documentation about various file systems
and manual pages which describe the available tools
and finally the SA would type the commands to complete the step.

So in essence the docent is most like a manual installation
but with the exception of having a virtual instructor nearby
willing to provide documentation that answers the SA's questions.

Of course the docent method will make the task of installation
require longer to complete with more thought and participation
from the person at the keyboard.
Consequently, the docent does not provide the level of convenience
that the menu driven installer and Sorcerer Sentient installer did.
However, the docent should help hone SA skills for those
who are capable of reading and learning from the documentation
and manual pages that the docent suggests.

Deployment can be as elaborate and complicated
as permitted by the desire and capability of the SA.
Or the installation process can be fast and simple.
A command line manual installation
always offers more potential possibilities
than a menu driven interface
that locks the person at the keyboard
inside a box of preselected possibilities.

The docent method of installation
represents a radical change in distribution paradigm.
Past goals were:
being enterprise ready; flexible for advance administration;
source based; frequently updated; never requiring re-deployment;
robust; capable of updating with minimal downloading;
and evolving with sensible evaluated changes rather than
recklessly jumping onto every new system or systemd.
I explicitly stated the goals above because
I intend a shift in importance.

The goals of frequent updating and being enterprise ready
should receive diminished importance.

The new goal of 2013,
evident by the intention of providing a docent installer,
is creating an experience
where learning and honing skills is integrated into tasks of deployment.
This way new Sorcerer SAs will come
to expect more from oneself
and less from the distribution.

The experience of will not be fluffy with powerful fancy GUI tools.
The experience will not be like computer based training
which provides tests/quizes to prove knowledge
and prints silly certificates to demonstrate achievement.
Nor will the experience be like floating
in the cold vacuum of space without a clue about what to do.

Instead opportunity for learning is provided
before the person at the keyboard attempts the task.
The result will be the sequence of learning doing accomplishing.
So the best aspects of computer based training
will be combined with actual experience of doing.
Hopefully that will impart more than knowledge
but also the skill to accomplish tasks.
More importantly than achieving the task at hand
is development of confidence
and to learn a method for accepting a task
without having first acquired relevant skills,
and then acquiring the skills and completing the task.

While teaching UNIX systems administration
the two aspects that I granted most importance were
tenacity and the ability to learn whatever is required to complete the task.
However, for more than a decade of providing a distribution
I have neglected creating a method for doing
which utilizes and encourages tenacity and learning.

And in recent years I attempted to provide a big helping hand with Sorcerer
Sentient
and with the novice menus of the menu driven installer.
But in retrospect I realized that I was arrogant
and that I was providing convenience,
but at the cost of a disservice to all but senior level SAs.
That is because the menu driven installer is fantastic for senior level SAs
who can already do manual installations blindfolded.
Skilled SAs require no additional learning to complete installation.
Therefore, the choice of using the installer or going manual was valid.

However, for average and neophyte SAs
the use of the menu driven installer or Sentient installer
omitted or rather deprived SAs of a grand opportunity for learning.
I regret that.

I admit that some of my decisions during the last 3 years were less than
ideal.
Abandoning the menu driven installer
is tantamount to admitting that my paradigm and intention
has changed over the course of a decade.
For all except skilled and semi-skilled SAs
the distro has been tough as iron nails to chew.
And perhaps my approach was arrogant, because from the start
all I wanted was a tool for advanced source based administration.

I was not noob unfriendly.
However, I expected everyone to hone skill by their own efforts.
If necessary I expected others to run a pre-compiled binary based distro
for a few years while gaining the skill and experience required
before becoming a Sorcerer SA.
So in retrospect I was respectful, but not compassionate towards noobs.

I was naive for expecting that the Sentient installer
was compassionate to noobs.
The exact opposite was so.
To truly extend a guiding hand to neophytes
might require something like a a docent
to help guide a manual installation
towards successful completion.

Please pardon the verbosity utilized to reach this point.
I expected that understanding the reasoning and experiences
could be useful for drawing the same conclusions.
I want to provide more than mere awareness of the change.
I want to nurture a favorable opinion.
I hope others will want to contribute feedback
so that the docent can become better and more comprehensive.

The first implementation will have about 30 steps.
That might seem like too many.
But of course some steps are entirely optional
such as the use of LVM2, mdRAID, LUKS, etc...
After feedback then I expect that the docent
on the following I/R could have closer to 40 or 50 steps.
I feel excited about that because each step
represents an opportunity for the person at the keyboard
to learn potentially useful knowledge.

To avoid prejudicing initial feedback
let us assume that instead of being nearly complete,
which it is, assume that the sub-project is at the design phase.
Consequently, I am eager to read about what steps
should be provided by the docent along with relevant documentation,
manual pages, etc..

Currently, the docent offers the suggestion of 23 manual pages
distributed across various steps, 5 TLDP HowTos,
3 documents from /usr/src/linux/ and /usr/src/linux/Documentation/,
a few documents in other places,
and 14 documents that I wrote.
The docent has already received considerable effort.
I still feel pleased about the possibility of unleashing it on the next I/R.

So if no feedback comes prior to the first release
it should still be usable and useful.
However, if anyone feels eager about the idea
then I am eager to read about what steps
and docs it should provide.

Thanks again for reading this absurdly long announcement.
As usual the list typically emanates quietness,
and the suddenly explodes with a huge message,
or a series of helpful tips.
So now seemed like as a good a time as any to let rip a mighty message.
Hopefully, it will be deemed worthy of reading.
Unless dissuaded then the I/Rs of 2013 and perhaps years to come
will have the docent and not the menu driven installer.
It is a radical change.
Consequently, I want everyone to feel
ready and eager to meet the challenge
when deploying new boxes.
