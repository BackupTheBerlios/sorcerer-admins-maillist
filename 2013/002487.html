<PRE>Is it entirely proper, currently broke, or just messy?
I wondered that for a short while,
because of some excellent bug reports by Evert.
Two additional related observations were included.
First, the I/R may be too old for use as repair.
Second, would be nice to be able to regenerate
the entire content of /boot/ without casting spells.
I completely concur.
And so here is what I propose.

First, this is how to craft a rescue boot label.
Assuming that the current boot works then try:

# rm -fr /boot/linux/rescue
# cp -r /boot/linux/$(uname -r) /boot/linux/rescue
# cp -r /boot/initrf /boot/linux/rescue/

The closer the kernel and initramfs images are to current
then the more useful they will be for rescue.

The first obvious aspect about the commands is that
linux specific files in /boot/linux/$VERSION/
That change can be considered cosmetic.

linux-kernel now installs files:
/usr/share/linux/$VERSION/{System.map,kernel}

/etc/initramfs-kernel
copies /usr/share/linux/ to /boot/
For the most part it is that simple.

If /boot becomes wrecked or removed
then the only commands to type are:
# mkdir -p /boot/
# /etc/init.d/initramfs force-reload
# /etc/init.d/extlinux force-reload

Not all root file systems will have a /boot/
Therefore, init-scripts will not create /boot/
when /boot/ does not already exist.

As previously discussed,
configuration files for the rootfs
that have the same name as configuration
files for a root file system yet different content
should be installed in /etc/rootfs/
Therefore, common entries in /etc/rootfs/ could be:
/etc/rootfs/{fstab,shadow}

I am restating information in the above paragraph
for anyone who missed the importance of it in the previous email.
And now onto the more subtle changes.
The remainder is optional reading.

/lib/modules/ is no longer protected from reaping.
Consequently, /lib/modules/ is expected to contain
merely the modules for the most recently installed Linux.
I am expecting the next question to be, &quot;why.&quot;

Software projects that install kernel modules
are only able to create modules for the installed linux
because that is the only Linux source which is installed.
Consequently, if the Linux booted is older than installed
then modules for the older Linux are not created.
So why keep it around?

Still require a module loaded?
No problem.
The easiest method is to ssh to port 30 for the computer's name
and log into the rootfs and run modprobe there.
The rootfs always retains modules for the booted kernel.
However, if /boot/linux/$(uname -r)/modules exists
then the cpio file can be decompressed and extracted
to re-populate /lib/modules/

The final solution is to not update /+/base/
until nearly ready to reboot.
What was formerly known as /media/root/main/ is now /+/base/
It is a minimal deployment of software adequate for
generating initramfs images and updating.
It should never require long to update.
And it will certainly retain /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/
until it is updated.

Consequently, maintaining a tidy /lib/modules/
costs minimal inconvenience.

Every reported seeing a looping with extlinux,
where the kernel loaded or did not load
and then extlinux looped back to the 3 second timer
as if POST just completed.
I had never seen that behavior before.
I played around with extlinux before discovering
that the behavior happens when encountering
either a kernel or perhaps more likely a initramfs image
that is not where the configuration file states.
As a result, I carefully examined and rewrote parts of
/etc/init.d/extlinux
After the 20131127 UTC 00:00 update
if any doubt exists then the /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf
can be regenerated with the command:
# /etc/init.d/extlinux force-reload

Lastly, no spells should install files within /boot/
/etc/init.d/extlinux is responsible for populating
/boot/extlinux/ with the 32-bit com files from /usr/share/syslinux/
Some curiosity might exist about that.

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Nov 25 18:06 /boot/extlinux/syslinux.conf -&gt;
extlinux.conf
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  8 Nov 25 18:06 /boot/syslinux -&gt; extlinux

Noticed the symbolic links yet?
When booting from a USB SSD the latest version of extlinux
can sometimes mistake itself for syslinux instead.
Or at least that was how it appeared.
After adding some symbolic links
the bootloader reported no problem locating configuration files.
May be a paranoid solution but it works for now.
It seems innocuous for booting computers
that do not require the symbolic links.
So as the cliche suggests,
&quot;Better safe than unable find bootloader configuration file.&quot;  ;)

Hopefully, the recent changes with regard to booting
will make booting more robust.
And /boot/ organization should inspire confidence.
It looks like it has no chance of not working.  :)
