<PRE>The menus presented during sysinit are problematic?
If possible enter the selection.
The selection will later be saved to the root file system
which is the progenitor for the rootfs.
However, if it can not be determined
then the selection can not be saved.

Log into /+/base/
Run the init-script
# /etc/init.d/loglevel start
Make the selection
It will save.
And then the prompt should not appear
on the following reboot
if the initramfs scripts properly consider
changes within /etc/init.d/conf.d/
to be worthy of init-script regeneration.
If not then it is a bug.
If it is a bug then regenerate the initramfs with:
# /etc/init.d/initramfs force-reload

I try to avoid using dialog for init-script interaction
during sysinit and runlevel execution.
However, some places exist where it happens
and I have not yet edited it.

Dialog is used frequently for the configuration
parameter for init-scripts.
Consequently, I can not merely grep for dialog
in order to determine which init-scripts to modify.
Thanks for reminding me about /etc/init.d/loglevel

The init-script which accepts passpharse input
for LUKS encrypted devices
no longer uses dialog for that.
I expected that might be the last of it.

After deployment and update
please be certain to transition files such as
/etc/fstab.rootfs
to /etc/rootfs/fstab
Remove the .rootfs from files in /etc/
and place them in /etc/rootfs/
That allows for /etc/hostname to specify
the hostname for /+/base/
while /etc/rootfs/hostname
specifies the hostname for the rootfs
So be certain to rename
/etc/hostname to /etc/rootfs/hostname
and /etc/rootname to /etc/hostname

Much of the code is prepared for the 2014 I/R,
but the documentation is not yet entirely up to date.
I do not do much testing of my computers
using the 2013 conventions.
However, I try to make the implementation changes
backward compatible at least until the new I/R is released.

6 months of hindsight is great for discovering/revealing
that the implementation should have been slightly different.  :)

Yet when trying something for the first time
and making the first implementation
then whatever works seems like a fine selection.
If I became obsessed about the small details
when I first created the implementation
then the implementation would have required
months longer in order to create.

My memory is a bit vague, but it was something like;
the first I/R for 2013 was scheduled for January.
And I did not complete it until about 6 months later.
So every month people would write and ask,
&quot;Is it done yet?&quot;
And I would reply,
&quot;Almost ready.  Probably next month.&quot;
No doubt some people became considerably irritated at me.
However, what is important is that when I released it; it worked as
expected.

So please pardon the changes.
Initially some snap decisions were required
in order to make progress towards a usable implementation.
Since I was not copying from anyone else,
I had plenty of planning, design, decisions, and implementations to create.
Please pardon if it seemed rough.
In 2013 it was just slightly better than proof of concept.
However, even at that I have no reason to complain.
I have been fully satisfied after transitioning my computers
to multi-root file systems.
I complain about a sporadically annoying kernel bug from time to time,
but the multi-root file system implementation seems fine.
And the utilization of /etc/rootfs/ will make it even better.
