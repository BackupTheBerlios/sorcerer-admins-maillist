<PRE>The benefit of testing and rebuilding on uniprocessor IA32 computers
revealed the inefficiencies of sorcery.
Enjoy the improvements.  :)

Foremost worth mentioning is that current logs are deprecated.
Updates of existing software and installation
of new software projects creates post logs.
Post logs are xz compressed UTF8 files
that differ somewhat from traditional install logs,
version logs, md5sum logs, etc...
However, all of that important information
is stored more concisely in a post log.
Most post logs have a size less than 4K.
Most file systems store files in units of 4K
Consequently,
# du -sk /aux/log/post/
2604
should not come as a surprise since
all of those tiny logs must round up to 4K.
Still post logs seems like a good compromise,
because parsing them is very fast,
creating them is reasonably fast,
and space utilization is minimal.
The main difference is that SAs
are not expected to be able to edit post logs.

Updating from current logs to post logs
will happen gradually at least for a while
until current logs support should be deprecated
in favor of a leaner faster sorcery.
The leisurely transition can be permitted because
information from current logs and post logs
are parsed and stored in indices when generating
the main index or when merging software catalogs.
That mitigates the potential performance deficit since
when the data is required without processing
then it is already available in indices.

Post logs and event logs were wasting file system space.
Especially some very small timing event logs
were rapidly consuming file system space.
Consequently, the SA request was modified
to provide the additional functionality
in the form of two new features.

event_time     additional logs that display duration for event
event_verbose  additional logs useful for POSIX admins

If duration required for processing events is desired
then Time Event type logs can be enabled with event_time.
It actually is not useful or perhaps not as useful
as the information contained in Max Stat logs
which are always created upon successful moil completion.
event_verbose will generate some empty event logs
that merely indicate that at event happened.
That might be useful if the SA wondered if events
happened in proper order or if an expected event did not happen.

Those two new features are of interest
only to those who want to debug sorcery, probably.
No reason exists to expect a bug in sorcery event transition.
A SA curious about the order of event processing;
requested the functionality.
I previously did not implement it as a feature.
But it aught to be a feature because it costs inodes
and some additional event logs cost additional file system space.

A more noteworthy change in events is that
the &quot;Pass Moil&quot; or &quot;Fail Moil&quot; event log contains
scroll accumulated during compilation.
It effectively replaces compile logs.
Access the content with the:
# au event-menu $SPELL
That might seem inconvenient at first,
but it creates cause for SAs to become familiar
with event logs and to learn and know what information
to expect in each type of event log.

The performance deficit for transitioning event logs from fore to yore
was not easily detected until doing a rebuild on a uniprocessor IA32.
However, after realizing the problem
the solution became obvious from retrospect.
And no surprise should exist that the solution involves directories.
Originally, I did not want a hierarchy involving directories.
Directories cost both inode and file system space.
However, the performance gain is worth the expense.

The immune-exam-transition spell transitions event logs
from the old hierarchy to the newer hierarchy.
Should require around a minute or less on most computers.
Duration depends on how many event logs exist.

If only the essential event logs are desired
then after the transition is achieved
the command to remove all yore event logs is:
# rm -fr /aux/log/event/yore/
Too easy right?
However, when the time comes when trying
to decide how something should be installed
based upon how something previously was installed
then having those yore event logs provides a welcome resource.
Yore event logs also become valuable when wanting
to view a previous compilation log to compare with current.
They store good information.
But it is way too much information
to be crammed into the system log.
And that is why event logs exist.

After watching a rebuild I realized that my eyes
were darting between the top and bottom of the terminal.
I want is all the interesting action close together.
Consequently, I reverted the scroll direction
from my odd selection of top to bottom
to the traditional direction of bottom to top.
That way when looking at the status lines at the bottom
then the future and then current action is located just above.
The scroll of elapsed events is above the current action
and extends to the top of the screen.

The change in scroll direction might assist neophytes.
It might create cause for irritation for those who prefer
reverse direction scrolling.
But the change is worth the strain of adjusting.

I forgot why I decided to scroll from top to bottom,
but maybe it was because at one time or another
the status lines for augur scry appeared at the top?
Implementing scroll in either direction is easily achieved,
however this method has the advantage that anything unexpected
about the amount of rows on the terminal emulation
will not cause important information to have scrolled off the top.
I could have moved the status lines to the top,
but changing the scroll direction for events
seemed a potentially more robust decision.

The many changes part of this sorcery update
will provide a sorcery that executes with far fewer CPU cycles
spent on overhead tasks such as logging.
The improvement can be observed
on both uniprocessor and SMP computers.
Because changing the status of an event log
from fore to yore is nearly instantaneous;
the queues tend not to accumulate.
And mass processing of spells in reap's queue
executes as rapidly as expected.
Events process so quickly now
that watching the action
is almost like watching corn pop
especially when processing many tiny software projects
such as those which provide perl modules.

Speaking of perl
I adjusted the spell to help mitigate if not eliminate
the possibility of perl having installed perl modules
that are also installed by perl--* module type spells.
That is important for the way spell owned file integrity is determined.
Consequently, using a utility instead of sorcery
to install and update perl modules will be somewhat
more problematic following an update of perl.
But that provides incentive for writing spells for perl modules.

Python and Python3 were also adjusted.
The main difference is that /usr/bin/python
is no longer installed.
That solves a few problems.
However, it creates many more problems than it solves.
Many spells were tested and discovered and repaired.
That was part of the purpose of doing rebuild testing.
After modifying the perl and Python spells;
I wanted to know exactly what was broke,
and of course to add additional lines to those spells
which circumvents problems.

/usr/bin/python is a deprecated concept.
Python does not provide backward compatibility like BASH and glibc.
The elimination of /usr/bin/python probably should have been decided
and made the norm with the update from Python 1.x versions
to Python 2.x versions instead of now at the time when
software projects are slowly transition to Python 3.
A few amount of software projects utilize Python 3.
It might be more problematic than Python 2,
because the method for providing multilib Python 3
was less than apparent.
The situation will be wait and see what becomes problematic
and then fix the source trees using spells
so those software projects can compile and install.
However, at the moment no such problems exist.

As a result to the change in perl and Python
problems might become evident following updates or a rebuild.
The fastest way to achieve a fix might be to report
the problem on the email list.
Then everyone can benefit.
KDE and gnome seems good to go with the changes.
I tested over 1000 spells.
However, the software catalog has more than 3000 spells.
Consequently, I am expecting that not all breaks were discovered.

I already began work on the improvements for the 2014 I/R.
Everyone can thank Evert for reminding me
to not update the stable version of glibc
until I am ready to roll and distribute new I/R ISO9660 images.
That is because the update of glibc on root file systems
will likely render the glibc on the Install/Rescue CDs
unusable for repairing root file systems.
It would also be unusable for running software on root file system
that was linked with a newer glibc than the version on the I/R.

glibc provides excellent and far better than average backward compatibility.
That is why re-compiling and re-linking all the installed software
on a root file system is not required following a glibc update.
Unfortunately, very few software projects provide forward compatibility.
glibc does not provide forward compatibility.
Symbols and functions would be missing from an older glibc library
required by software that compiled and linked with a newer glibc.
This is easy to forget.
Anytime I update the stable version of glibc
without concurrently releasing new I/Rs images
is a perfect example of me forgetting about
the lack of forward compatibility.
Sorry about that.
I added a note to the top of the glibc spell
to remind myself not to test and update glibc
until ready to release new I/R.
Consequently, that should no longer become problematic.

So if anyone was wondering why I am sitting on
a potential glibc update instead of processing it
then the answer is that I am not yet ready
to release newer Install/Rescue images.
Consequently, expect glibc to update to a newer version
perhaps once, maybe twice, but no more than twice a year.

So in summary logging changed,
sorcery became faster,
augur scry scrolls in reverse,
and installation for perl and Python
changed hopefully for the better.
However, I probably omitted many
other potentially interesting changes.
One just came to mind.
Consequently, I will mention it.

A profile spell called &quot;static&quot; was created.
# au begin static
can allow the selection of installing
statically linked executable files
for a few software projects.
The statically linked executable files
land in /usr/{,s}bin/ while the dynamically linked
executable files land in /{,s}bin/
Therefore, no file overlap exists.

Statically linked executable files
require more disk space than dynamically linked executable files.
And more memory is required during execution.
However, the main benefit is that execution
could begin 3 to perhaps 5 times faster
than a dynamically linked executable file.
That is because ld.so the dynamic linker
does not run when the process begins.

ld.so has the task of locating and loading
shared object libraries into memory and then
adjusting locations in a program to call the functions
provided in shared libraries.
More succinctly stated
dynamically linked programs require more CPU cycles to run.
Therefore, when the task being performed is minimal
then having the program begin sooner
allows the task to be completed sooner.
For programs such as find, sed, grep,
and several utilities installed by coreutils
a performance benefit can be realized
by providing some of the utilities
also as statically linked executable files.

In the past I added switches to certain spells
to allow the SA to select if the installed executable
files for a spell were statically or dynamically linked.
That method was more efficient and required less
CPU cycles for compilation and linking when compared
with the current method that uses separate spells.
Using separate spells provides simplicity and flexibility.
Due to the requirement of having certain static libraries,
also called ar libraries or archive libraries or .a files,
a spell such as static--pcre
can install that libpcre.a file
without having pcre install it by default.
Therefore, the potential convenience
of statically linked executable files can be offered
without increasing the minimal installation size
of other spells such as
pcre, ncurses, readline, e2fsprogs, zlib, bzip2, etc...

Please forgive if the explanation is overkill.
Executable files that are statically linked with glibc
become bloated where 90% of the code in the program never executes.
That could be called a design or defect of glibc.
Consequently, the benefit of a statically linked executable file
might not be easily surmised by a typical SA.
What is to like about a program
that requires a magnitude more file system space
and probably that much more memory when running?
However, having the process complete
3 to 5 times faster is the likable quality.

The benefit of statically linked executable files
has the least drawbacks on a computer with plenty of RAM.
That is because the larger utilities
require more space in the kernel's block device cache.
With an insufficient amount of installed RAM
then statically linked executable files
could be forcing out potentially valuable data from the kernel's cache.
Consequently, only install the statically linked executable files
on computers that always have plenty of RAM for the kernel's cache.

True enough executable files statically linked with uClibc
would be a magnitude smaller than the same linked with glibc.
But the cost in CPU cycles to compile and cost in file system space
to store the tool chain for creating those few statically linked utilities
seemed to mitigate if not defeat the benefit.
Creating that tool chain is tempting.
Yet, for the meanwhile we can wish for glibc development
to achieve a better compromise with it's performance to size ratio.

Most software projects tend to bloat over time
rather than staying lean and efficient.
Fortunately, sorcery development includes re-evaluation
of the code and performance to ensure a favorable compromise
between speed, size, and functionality continues to exists.
Consequently, many of the changes in this newer sorcery
ensure that performance remains adequate
on both legacy uniprocessor computers
and also more modern 64-bit SMP computers.
