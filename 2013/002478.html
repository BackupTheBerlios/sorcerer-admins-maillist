<PRE>Spell ownership was an exciting feature, yes?
No?
I like it.
And after using it for a while
perhaps all the potential bugs were smote.
To make up for it, please enjoy a new batch of potential bugs.

The new features are called immutable and noatime.
They are similar.
They modify the attributes of spell installed files.
noatime is applied to all spell installed files.
immutable is applied to spell files that are not configuration files are
not located in /var/ and are significant.
Info pages, documents, manual pages, locale translation files and such are
not significant.

View the chattr and lsattr manual pages
for a verbose description of the attribute effect.

The succinct descriptions are:
noatime could be beneficial when enabled on laptops;
immutable could prevent unintentional file modification or deletion.

Symbolic links can not have attributes.
Attributes work on file systems that support attributes such as ext2 ext3
ext4.
It probably works on XFS.
Maybe it works on BTRFS.
I did not test on XFS and BTRFS.
If it does not work then it will not work,
but otherwise will probably not become problematic
if it does not work.

Neophytes probably lack awareness concerning attributes.
For years I have rarely used them.
I only recently decided to integrate more support for attributes into
sorcery.
The lack of attribute support across all file systems
became cause for hesitation for over a decade.

Do not become overly excited when reading the manual pages.
Certain attributes such as the undelete attribute
receive no support in the ext2 ext3 ext4 file systems.

And granting the immutable attribute only mitigates unintentional
modification.
Any process that intends to modify a file
can change the file's attributes, modify the file, and restore the original
attributes.
It is not any approximation of security measure.
