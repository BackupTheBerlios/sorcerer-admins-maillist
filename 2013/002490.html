<PRE>Hi there, and welcome to Sorcerer.
augur does not have a manpage. Instead, just type &quot;augur&quot; on the
command line, and it will tel you it's options.
One of us might write a manpage someday...

On your second question, the short answer is yes it does, but you
don't want to mess with it.

Longer answer:
Because I know you want to mess with it, and it's your machine and
your right, I'll explain the mechanism to you, but if you blow up your
box, don't blame me.

Sorcery will by default read:
/etc/sorcery/cpref/default

If that file does not exist, sorcery will pick sensible defaults,
which you can fine-tune in the sorcery menu. You will basically get
optimization -O0 for most small packages, and -O2 for stuff that makes
sense to have optimized, and some esoteric flags for spells that needs
them.

In the Sorcery menu, under &quot;Toggle&quot; sorcerer features, you can select
whether to compile for base architecture or not. This switches default
between -mtune=native and -march=native.
You can also switch on &quot;lto&quot; for link time optimizations. If you want,
switch on the complementary -Os for spells that have the &quot;lto&quot;
capability.

Now, if that is not specific enough for you, and you want to specify a
default that is different from what I described above, here is how:

# mkdir -p /etc/sorcery/cpref
# nano mtune-O2

inside, put your CFLAGS, like so:

export CFLAGS=&quot;$CFLAGS -march=native -O2 -pipe -fno-warnings &quot;
export CXXFLAGS=&quot;$CFLAGS &quot;

Or whatever you may like.
To make sorcerer compile with those enabled,
# ln -s /etc/sorcery/cpref/mtune-O2 /etc/sorcery/cpref/default

Please let me re-iterate that this changes the defaults to whatever
you put in that file, and can completely break your box. Also, it
probably won't have the desired effect of making everything faster. I
used to run with a default cpref pretty close to the one I described
until very recently. Now I don't, and let sorcery pick the cflags for
spells, and my desktop &quot;feels&quot; more responsive.

However, there is some really useful application for when you want to
mess with just one spell's cflags:

# augur cpref $SPELL &lt;tab&gt; &lt;tab&gt;   &lt;- will list the files in /etc/sorcery/cpref
# augur cpref $SPELL $CPREF_FILE    &lt;- will set that spell to utilize
the cpref file that you make.
# augur cpref $SPELL  &lt;- will clear the custom cpref for that file
# augur cpref    &lt;- will just list the spells with custom cpref

For instance, I have in i7 laptop. Current firefox segfaults when
-march=native is passed to it, because it gcc gets the avx features of
my CPU wrong. Just for firefox. strange, but I like compiling for my
cpu type, so now I have the following file
/etc/sorcery/cpref/firefox

Contents of which:
export CFLAGS=&quot; $CFLAGS -mno-avx &quot;
export CXXFLAGS=&quot; $CXXFLAGS -mno-avx &quot;

I issued the following command:
augur cpref firefox firefox

And now just firefox is compiled with the added -mno-avx

The same mechanism can be applied to any single spell that you want to
mess with, and limits the potential damage to the rest of your box.

Have fun.
