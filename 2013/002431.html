<PRE>I also am unable to log in with ssh.
Could be that that I misconfigured networking.
Networking on the Ethernet adapters should begin during sysinit.
Then, the VETH are created.
One of each VETH pair are moved into a root file system.
Then later during runlevel the VETH in each root file system is initialized.
The IP address to use is determined by the VETH's name.
And then any other IP address to assign to the VETH
is acquired from /etc/hosts where the the content of /etc/rootname
matches a line providing an IP address in /etc/hosts

If a line accidentally existed but perhaps should not have
then the same IP address might have been assigned to the
Ethernet adapter in the rootfs and the VETH in the root file system.
I do not know what happens if that happens,
but if it happens it probably might not work.

If only ssh worked I might be able to identify and fix other problems
remotely.
However, at the moment logind is likely to be running.
If not then a login is started on virtual console #2 that lasts as long as
sysinit.
Error messages in the login scroll remain in the screen buffer
provided that the active virtual console is not changed.
Scrolling the visible portion of the screen buffer
is accomplished by pressing and holding the left shift key
while pressing either page up or page down keys.
On some computers all the lines from the moment the kernel first
started printing them until the completion of the runlevel will be visible.

Hints about what init-scripts passed and failed are stored in /var/log/init/
Those that failed have directories in /var/log/init/failed/
The /var/log/init/ on the rootfs differs from the /var/log/init/ on root
file systems.
The rootfs one only contains information about init-scripts that ran during
sysinit.
Likewise the /var/log/init/ on root file systems on provide information
that pertains to what happened during the runlevel execution
for that root file system.

By first scrolling upwards from the end of the boot
any clues about what failed should be there.
If logind is running then login to the rootfs and root file system should
be possible.
If logind is not running then login would be possible during sysinit
by switching to the second or next active virtual console.
If for some reason that did not work then a shell can be provide
instead of going through the normal login process by booting a label
and providing the additional kernel parameter of bash
That is preferred over rdinit=/bin/bash because on some computers
modules must be loaded before a USB keyboard becomes available.

The fault of the computers not booting is mine.
I made some sort of error.
I was not able to check it, because the computer is located remotely.
If I were debugging the problem then I would be curious as to
whether the network adapter in the rootfs is configured correctly
and as to whether the VETH in the root file system configured correctly.

If ssh access is restored then I can probably investigate and repair
any lingering problems.
Since I feel certain that I remembered to put the rootname in /etc/rootname
then my best guess why networking might not be working is that
a line exists in /etc/hosts for the rootname and that same IP address
is being assigned to the network adapters in the rootfs and
the VETH in the root file system.
But that is just a wild guess.
