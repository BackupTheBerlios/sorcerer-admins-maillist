<PRE>Since introducing the sorcery utility scan
several software projects might be frequently re-installing.
That is typically caused because two installed software projects
are sharing ownership of file names that differ in content.
I have been editing spells to help eliminate the overlap.
Eventually, all that overlap should be eliminated.
Remaining overlapped files will share the same content.
Or the overlap will be explicitly ignored by the sorcery utilities
to circumvent inaccurate Fail Scan outcomes.

And now for the big, Big, BIG news.
My patch for &quot;cat&quot; submitted to the coreutils email list was rejected.
No problemo.
I wrote a utility that works better
for the task of generating message digests
for installed files.
It supports opening files with O_DIRECT flag
to omit deluging the kernel's block cache
and to verify the content of files,
as seen from their backing device,
rather than receiving the kernel's cached blocks.
And it runs without using requiring xargs
and without the necessity of piping output
into another utility for generating the message digests:

Here is code that represents a method that utilizes
utilities from software projects &quot;coreutils&quot; and &quot;findutils.&quot;

# sed &quot;s:^:if=&quot; filenames.txt |
 xargs -r --max-lines=1 dd direct |
 sha512sum |
 cut -b1-64

xargs invokes once dd once per filename.
Therefore, if running on 100,000 files
then 100,004 processes are created.
That amounts to significant processor overhead.

# baresha256 -d &lt; filenames.txt

One process is created and the output
is the sha512 message digest for the concatenated content
of the files listed in filenames.txt
That is performance.

Probably noticed by now;
I switched from using md5sum to sha512.
That is because md5sum was cryptographically broke in 1996.
Some people might prefer
a cryptographically secure message digest.
Consequently, I went ahead and selected one that seems good.

The change in sorcery code will render the previously stored
message digests invalid for all installed spells.
Consequently, expect sorcery to rebuild root file systems
following the installation of the newer sorcery.

If wondering why all the re-compilation
then the answer is to ultimately provide
a level of file system integrity that spots
and remedies problems quickly and automatically.
Please forgive the inconvenience the transition causes.
