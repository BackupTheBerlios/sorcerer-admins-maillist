<PRE>Hi all!
well I'm far behind sorcery usage since it runs on a home server for years
without maintainance ;) however if you change theming, instead of complex
name, take usual english words....
for example ifconfig became ip.... so I think that cast shall become
something like compile, augur shall become something like software or
soft_manager.... well something that some *neewbee* shall find without
knowing latain... ;)

&gt;<i> Everyone should know by now that the name for
</I>&gt;<i> the original source administration tools was
</I>&gt;<i> to stop people from saying &quot;package this&quot; and &quot;package that.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> I picked what seemed like a fun and potentially useful theme
</I>&gt;<i> that might help mitigate the learning curve by using
</I>&gt;<i> nomenclature similar to that found in early
</I>&gt;<i> computer role play games, bulletin board systems, etc...
</I>&gt;<i> However, the paradigm of magic failed to encompass
</I>&gt;<i> the scope of the tasks being accomplished.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, the nomenclature expanded away from
</I>&gt;<i> the theme of magic and into the realm of simple English words.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Inspired by the evolution of the Linux kernel
</I>&gt;<i> the source administration tools also evolved,
</I>&gt;<i> along with most aspects of this POSIX.
</I>&gt;<i> The current techniques demonstrate the refinement
</I>&gt;<i> of more than a decade's worth of hindsight.
</I>&gt;<i> What began as a rude implementation become refined.
</I>&gt;<i> It evolved from the rude to refined and therefore has earned
</I>&gt;<i> the title EruditeTechnic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The new name of the tools is: EruditeTechnic.
</I>&gt;<i> Erudite means to have emerged from a rude state into a refined state.
</I>&gt;<i> Technic is merely an alternative spelling and pronunciation
</I>&gt;<i> of the word technique.
</I>&gt;<i> All the magical themed nomenclature is deprecated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what have spells become?
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, spells are now technic.
</I>&gt;<i> And since we have all become far too accustomed
</I>&gt;<i> to typing au the &quot;augur&quot; utility transmuted into aurum.
</I>&gt;<i> Aurum is the Latin word for gold.
</I>&gt;<i> Unlike the names for tools with delegated tasks
</I>&gt;<i> aurum has no special meaning to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the aurum modules are changing names.
</I>&gt;<i> The menu driven aspect of the utility became
</I>&gt;<i> # aurum menu
</I>&gt;<i> # aurum survey
</I>&gt;<i> replaces
</I>&gt;<i> # augur scry.
</I>&gt;<i> To view a specific event log type
</I>&gt;<i> # au event $TECHNIC
</I>&gt;<i> where $TECHNIC is the name of a technic.
</I>&gt;<i> To view a mess of event logs for a technic
</I>&gt;<i> or for a period of recently elapsed days run:
</I>&gt;<i> # au events $DAYS
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> # au events $TECHNIC
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the command modules receive shorter names
</I>&gt;<i> some of them receive longer names,
</I>&gt;<i> yet most of the stay the same.
</I>&gt;<i> The new names are similar to the old names.
</I>&gt;<i> Learning to type the newer names
</I>&gt;<i> may require from more practice
</I>&gt;<i> than the instant required to learn the new names.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I still do not want to write a manual page for aurum;
</I>&gt;<i> I did revise the terse documentation that goes with the tools.
</I>&gt;<i> It is installed as /usr/share/doc/EruditeTechnic/EruditeTechnic
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As previously mentioned I want to re-iterate that
</I>&gt;<i> abandoning the previous theme became essential
</I>&gt;<i> for the refinement of the tools.
</I>&gt;<i> After the tools progressed from a tri-queue system
</I>&gt;<i> to having more than 10 queues
</I>&gt;<i> most of the old nomenclature had become useless.
</I>&gt;<i> However, for more than 6 months backward compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> was provided for SAs that did not want
</I>&gt;<i> to learn the method of loading queues using the queue module.
</I>&gt;<i> However, sufficient time elapsed for all SAs to discover
</I>&gt;<i> the superiority of wielding queues.
</I>&gt;<i> So after more than a year where /usr/libexec/sorcery/{cast,dispel}
</I>&gt;<i> no longer exited eventually /usr/sbin/{cast,dispel}
</I>&gt;<i> were also retired.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many years before I mentioned that the tools and POSIX
</I>&gt;<i> would eventually depart from the theme of magic.
</I>&gt;<i> Some people responded by saying that they would
</I>&gt;<i> quit deploying this POSIX after I make such a change.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet, by now those SAs have either departed or
</I>&gt;<i> discovered that the lore they acquired is their power.
</I>&gt;<i> The tools are merely a convenience for sharing
</I>&gt;<i> technique that makes accomplishing the task of source
</I>&gt;<i> based administration nearly effortless and without tedium.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As usual consider the change in aurum module names
</I>&gt;<i> to be the annual Easter egg hunt.
</I>&gt;<i> More modules will likely change names between now and 2014.
</I>&gt;<i> The changes might seem fickle or cosmetic, yet few are.
</I>&gt;<i> Some changes might merely allow faster tab completion
</I>&gt;<i> of an aurum parameter.
</I>&gt;<i> So for the inconvenience of every change
</I>&gt;<i> at least one benefit is obtained.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, everyone likes the new name.
</I>&gt;<i> It is a name as audacious as the tools.
</I>&gt;<i> And every year I say something like...
</I>&gt;<i> The sorcery we have now is nothing like
</I>&gt;<i> the sorcery we wielded just 2 years ago.
</I>&gt;<i> And it is so.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, it is overdue for receiving a new name
</I>&gt;<i> rather than merely a new focal subtitle.
</I>&gt;<i> I present EruditeTechnic.
</I>&gt;<i>
