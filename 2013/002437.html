&gt;<i> Hi folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Howdy.
Normally, I go with what Evert says.
However, this is an infrequent moment.
The new I/Rs, Install/Rescue images, are only about a month old.
I did not ask Evert to review them.
And they are considerably different from 2012 I/Rs.
The 2013 I/R lacks a menu driven installer program.

The 2013 I/R provides a deployment docent.
It is an enhancement to the shell that provides guidance
through the steps of deployment in a very orderly step by step method.
The guidance comes in the form of recommending for reading
documentation provided with the deployment docent,
HowTos, manual pages, and more.
It also provides recommended vocabulary or argot
and provides the definitions for commonly encountered argot.
Anyone capable of completing a deployment
with the assistance of the deployment docent
hones general SA skills and improves understanding of how POSIXs work.

The goal of the deployment docent is not merely deployment.
It was designed in response from SAs and non SAs
requesting that for computer based training to be provided.

After a SA successfully completes the deployment docent once or twice
then sufficient skill should be acquired for the SA to be able
to deploy a POSIX by the SA's own methods and without a deployment docent.
Therefore, the intended possibility becomes that SAs gained
sufficient skill required for writing a script for fast mass deployment.

The 2012 and earlier Install/Rescue recommended method for deployment
was the use of the included menu driven program.
However, from feedback I concluded that the use of menu driven program
was not encouraging others to gain comprehension nor SA skills.
Those who lacked essential SA skills remained incapable
of piloting their newly deployed POSIX.

Consider the deployment docent to be a fun challenge.
The experience is almost like doing a deployment entirely on one's own.
Yet the docent provides assistance similar to a teacher
standing behind watching progress while being eager and willing
to answer questions and recommend relevant documentation for reading.

I assume it's OK to ask stupid newbie questions here? I've been reading
&gt;<i> what's in the iso and have my drives GPT partitioned/formatted, with swap.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a HOWTO or something written to get us newbies started (and, where
</I>&gt;<i> is it located) or should I just assume I'm on my own here?; which is OK if
</I>&gt;<i> I am expected to do all this on my own but some pointers to help save me
</I>&gt;<i> some time would be very welcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Either an I/R on CD or an I/R on a USB SSD, or an I/R ISO9660 image file
should exist.
An I/R on CD or an I/R on USB SSD is required for deployment to actual
hardware,
in most situations where a POSIX is not already installed
and can be used to deploy the new I/R onto a fresh device.
An ISO96600 image file is sufficient for deploying into a virtual machine's
disk file.
I recommend QEMU as the choice of a virtual machine emulation program.
The I/Rs are all tested using QEMU's HVM, hardware virtual machine.

As Evert previously mentioned, the new I/R is always a moving target.
Therefore, what was written about the I/R before and provided in the form
of external documentation might apply in part or not at all to the next I/R.
Having paper in hand is often a relaxing feeling
because it can be read the night before attempting a project.
However, a different compromise was selected.

Consider the deployment docent to be like integrated documentation.
It provides step by step guidance for achieving deployment.
It can sometimes perform tests at certain steps to verify
that the SA has successfully achieved the desired outcome.
In many ways it can be superior to a written documentation.
Relevant documentation for steps previously performed
and memorized can be omitted from re-reading.
The deployment docent does not trap the SA into a box like a menu driven
program.
The SA is free to do whatever is desired from the shell
such as rescuing a previously deployed computer if that is desired.

The main assumption behind this POSIX is that SAs
either have honed SA skills or desire to hone their SA skills.
Because of that a minimal amount of fluff separates the person
from the actual tools being used to accomplish tasks.
init-scripts are provided for accomplishing
certain delicate and complicated tasks
such as generating initramfs images.
However, some SAs elect to learn and master those skills also,
especially if a shaved initramfs is desired
instead of the luxuriously stocked initramfs provided by the init-scripts.
Please forgive the digression.
The main point is that SAs will learn
and the deployment docent guides learning by providing
the reference to the documentation that is relevant for accomplishing
the goals specified for the current step.

If the documentation provided merely with the docent,
and not manual pages and not HowTos and not anything else
was trimmed of empty lines and printed 60 lines per page
then that alone would amount to about 70 pages of print.
It is an ample source of information.
I authored it.  :)
However, I do not recommend anyone read it cover to cover.
Far more understanding and skill is gained by applying the knowledge
during the process of deployment.
Reading a book about how to ride a bicycle is no substitute
for the skill gained by actually attempting to ride a bicycle.
Likewise the skill gained from the experience of deployment
is not imparted by merely reading 70 to 100 pages of documentation.

Instead the goal is to have potential SAs dive in.
Everyone who has sufficient tenacity
will be able to surmount the challenge of deployment.
The amount of tries required before achieving a successful deployment is
unimportant.
Learning is important.

When achieving a successful deployment was accorded importance;
a method for deployment was provided which
asked about 3 simple questions
and then created file systems and installed automatically.
The method was called &quot;Sorcerer Sentient.&quot;
After discovering that those who used &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot;
were not honing their SAs skills;
the &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; method was discontinued.

The most simple explanation becomes,
&quot;A skilled SA is more important than a deployed POSIX.&quot;
The deployment docent might not transform computer neophytes into skilled
SAs.
However, it should impart some of the lore that a skilled SA will have
acquired.
It becomes a journey in a desirable direction.

And before I forget to mention it.
The current 2013 I/R and tools on it are designed to handle devices
with both legacy partition tables and GPT.
However, the deployment docent only describes the tools
that are required for deploying onto GPT.
GPT is sweet, but I only began using it around first quarter of 2013.
So it still seems new and awesome to me.  :)

I am happy that GPT exists mainly because
I prefer partitioning over use of LVM2.
And having many partitions available is highly advantageous
when deploying this POSIX.
I used something like 12 or more partitions
when I last re-deployed my workstation.



&gt;<i> I'm coming from a Slackware background so I'm not afraid to type, read,
</I>&gt;<i> think, and look things up myself. I kept reading about 'Deployment' but
</I>&gt;<i> cannot find anything other than references to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
When the I/R is booted
it should provide the deployment docent
rather than a login prompt.
If a BASH shell enhanced with the deployment docent is not present
then that is unexpected.
Please describe what happens during the boot of the 2013 I/R,
and also whether it is the IA32 I/R or the x86_64 I/R.



&gt;<i> I apologize if this is off-topic here. I just discovered Sorcerer Linux,
</I>&gt;<i> by accident, two days ago. I was at distrowatch and kept hitting the
</I>&gt;<i> 'random distro' button when Sorcerer Linux appeared and peaked my
</I>&gt;<i> curiosity. I was just getting ready to put Slackware on my new box until I
</I>&gt;<i> stumbled across Sorcerer Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Slackware is older than Sorcerer.
A long time ago I tried Slackware for a time and enjoyed it.
I tried many POSIX before Debian became my favorite
pre-compiled binary package based POSIX.
And then I wanted a tool for advanced administration from source
that I could use concurrently on Debian.
However, after I released sorcery feedback from others strongly
requested that I create an entire POSIX based upon sorcery technology.
But enough about ancient history.  :)

The word &quot;Sorcerer&quot; now refers more to the role of the SA
rather than the name of the POSIX.
The current name of this POSIX is &quot;Modern Magic.&quot;
Sometime a while ago I forked my POSIX
into two rather different variations
that effected both deployment and administration.

The first I already mentioned was &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; and it was
discontinued.
Yes it easily granted a deployed POSIX.
Yet if anything non trivial was required such as network configuration
then the lack of SA skills became an insurmountable problem for neophytes.
SAs were not using &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; for training which was it's original
purpose.
It offered several tutorials through augur that would gradually unlock the
augur commands
as a person gained knowledge and understanding
of both the POSIX and tools wielded by system administrators.

&quot;Modern Magic&quot; is currently offered.
In 2013 Modern Magic was re-implemented in two important ways.
First, the tools were re-designed for smoother operation on 8+ processor SMP
computers where I/O is primarily on a single fixed disk.
This was achieved by precise delegation of duties to specific programs and
queues.
And finally the order of execution and the programs allowed to execute
concurrently
was tailored to allow concurrent execution of tasks that require
significant CPU cycles
and linear execution of tasks that require significant device I/O.

Second, the deployment docent was introduced on the I/R
in order to create an experience of deployment
that not only achieves a successful deployment
but also hones important SA skills.
No further attempts will be made to provide a POSIX
that competes in the noob friendly niche.
Those who attempt deployment must learn and master
the tools required for accomplishing the task of deployment
or switch to a fluffy bunny POSIX with happy snappy GUIs
that hide all of the complexity and usurp all of the power.

Is &quot;Modern Magic&quot; just a name?
Actually, it is rather modern.
The implementation for 2013 and the deployment docent design
allows for what is called multi-root deployment onto a computer.
The idea is rather simple to understand
if a person already knows the definition for the argot.
The computer will run a single Linux kernel
that will coordinate resource utilization for multiple root file systems.
The rootfs which is provided from the initramfs images generated
from the &quot;main&quot; root file system acts like a firewall/router.
Each root file system receives it's own VETH, virtual Ethernet adapter,
which is part of a pair where the other portion resides in the rootfs net
namespace.
And the rootfs can forward packets to VETH for root file systems.
VETH inside a root file system
can have it's IP address assigned both dynamically and statically.
The use of:
VETH;
unshared mount namespace;
unshared net namespace;
unshared PID namespace;
unshared UTC namespace
and so forth are new functionality provided
in recent versions of the Linux kernel.
It is fun and useful.
For a while it was so new that developmental versions of util-linux
were installed in order to provide the tools required
for utilization of the unshared namespace functionality.

For resource utilization multiple root file systems are superior
to both HVM and PVs.
HVM and PVs are implementations of virtual computers.
Therefore, another way of saying it is that multiple root file systems
provide superior resource utilization as compared to virtual computers.
A multi-root deployment is also superior for block caching mass storage
devices.
However, virtual computers are superior at the task of
isolating and protecting the host operating system.
Some situations exist where a virtual machine would be more desirable
such as for preventing an intrusion that gained EUID 0 from wrecking a
fixed disk.
Another way to protect is to lock it down with tomoyo.
Good to have a choice or to even to use both HVMs and multiple roots.

My workstation consists of 6 root file systems and 3 QEMU HVM virtual
computers.
Is that groovy?  Feels groovy to me.
I sometimes wonder how I ever managed before multi-root file systems.
Multiple root file systems are so convenient.
I can either log in via a virtual console or
using the GUI login program running on a root file system
or ssh into it, or scp files to and from it.
The effect of multiple root file systems is exactly the same
as if I had additional computers on my LAN.
And by using control groups a specific amount of resources
can be delegated to each root file system.
For example, I tend to prevent most root file systems
from running processes on the first processor.
Many of the root file systems have both a RAM soft and hard utilization
limits
and a swap utilization limit.
If for some odd and unexpected reason a fork bomb 'sploded on a root file
system
then it would not be able to create a denial of service in other root file
systems
nor within the rootfs.
Therefore, I could log into any of the other root file systems
or log directly into the rootfs and deal with the problem.
As I previously mentioned it is very groovy.

Multiple root file systems and control groups are a perfect compliment
and are both examples of some of the most innovative technology that
Linux kernel hackers have provided.
Control groups provide a method for resource delegation that is far superior
to POSIX and UNIX specified methods.
However, control groups is very Linux specific.
Only those who run a Linux kernel gain the benefit of control groups.

UNIX seems to always have been designed as a multi-user operating system.
However, it might never have been designed
to be a multi-root file system operating system.
Running multiple root file systems was far from impossible.
However, complications previously existed.
The introduction of unshared namespace and VETHs circumvented
those problems and made multiple root file systems viable.
Again this is functionality provided exclusively on Linux
by those clever Linux kernel hackers.
The only credit that I can take is for redesigning the init-scripts
to become compatible with a multi-root deployment.
Any Linux based POSIX should be able to provide multiple-root file system
support
if the maintainers provide compatible init-scripts.
But it might not gain popularity when HVMs and PVs can be created instead
that can run fine without revision and testing of init-scripts.

In a 3 way comparison between
user mode Linux, HVMs + PVs, and multiple root file systems;
my preference became multiple root file systems.
I admit that it required an embarrassingly long amount of time and effort
for me to hone the init-scripts into adequate shape for the task.
Yet I am not displeased for having the convenience.
When considering the benefits of GPT + control groups + VETH + unshared
namespace
it all points in the direction of providing multiple root file systems.
I felt eager to give it a try during 2012 even before unshared name space.
I felt very certain that 2013 would be the year that Modern Magic gains
support for multiple root file systems.
And I made it happen, however, I required nearly half the year
to prepare everything satisfactorily for the 2013 I/R and the 2013 Modern
Magic.
And now everyone can enjoy it.

So in summary, the new 2013 I/Rs were released about a month ago.
It is called &quot;Modern Magic.&quot;
And due to the improved support for SMP
and support for multi-root file systems it is definitely modern.
Deployment can be accomplished by anyone
who can follow the suggestions provided by the deployment docent.
And the experience is more of a read and learn as necessary
to accomplish each step of deployment
rather than read a 1000 page document the night before before booting the
I/R.
Please feel invited to send feedback.
If the experience is less than adequate
then definitely provide feedback.
All feedback is accumulated and eventually acted upon.

The fact that &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; was tried and the discontinued
goes to show that feedback shapes the evolution of this POSIX.
That which achieves outcomes that are incommensurate with intention
become discontinued in order to direct effort towards sub-projects
that provide more benefit.
And everyone is learning and occasionally making mistakes,
myself include even after providing this POSIX for more than a decade.

Therefore, nobody should feel as if successful deployment
should be achieved as the outcome of the first adventure
with the deployment docent.
Failure often teaches more than success.
And the deployment docent is not a pathetic test for a classroom course
or at least nobody should use it for that purpose.
It is intended as an instructional aid so that those who possess SA
potential
but not yet acquired SA lore can be directed towards documentation
that will provide information relevant for the current task.
It is a form of computer based training
that is integrated directly into the process of deployment.
Hopefully, it will become a positive experience for potential SAs
and a useful aid for experienced SAs.

P.S.
Although what follows is merely my opinion I enjoy using the deployment
docent.
One of the steps is for testing ALSA audio by playing some ogg files
using the mocp command line audio playing client/daemon program.
Listening to the music should provide a nice tangible reward that
demonstrates
that skill is being acquired and applied towards the goal of successful
deployment.
The amount of steps for achieving deployment is long; so long that I lost
count.
I can hop through them all in about 10 minutes or less, perhaps 5 minutes
or less.
Although I am not reading documentation,
the process of going through each step
helps ensure that I do not accidentally
omit doing something essential for achieving successful deployment.
The process of deployment could be an intense adventure for neophytes.
Therefore, I am hoping that the musical interlude helps sustain interest
and a positive feeling that progress is being accomplished.
The experience is not as hard-core as I made it sound in the message,
but is also intended to provide amusement.
Hopefully, in the future I will be able to provide definitions for more
argot.
For now I hope SAs and potentials are able to achieve deployment
without having unfamiliar argot create insurmountable confusion and
disinterest.
