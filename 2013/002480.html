<PRE>First support for a file that specifies files that are protected
from removal is discontinued.
No cause to worry.
Create a custom spell.
Specifying immutable files there
the same way I specify them in my spells.

with protect /usr/libexec/sorcery/config

The above line protects the above file from being removed.

with protect /opt/forever/

The above line protects the entire hierarchy of files
and directories that are within /opt/forever/

The venerable vernacular of &quot;cast&quot; and &quot;dispel&quot; are deprecated.
The words no longer aid understanding.

The staging queues for moil and reap are
moil/mull and reap/mull, respectively.

# augur newer

The above command populates moil/mull

Content of staging queues are moved to into the primary queue
upon execution of

# augur begin

Therefore, between
# augur newer
and
# augur begin

# augur queue -$SPELL
can remove spells from any queue.
Or if preferred
# augur queue -moil/mull/$SPELL
can accomplish the precise task.

Maybe only a few sorcery have the immutable feature enabled.
It worked better than expected.
But now that a bug has been fixed
it should work exactly as expected.
Bugged versions of sorcery will not only not remove immutable files,
but will also not remove the attribute from an immutable file during
reaping.
While the file remains immutable
it can not be overwritten by a newer version.
This was effecting file /usr/libexec/sorcery/config
However, after a couple of updates with the fixed sorcery
the configuration file will update to current.

The welding method has a slight problem involving time stamps.
However, the problem is identified and fixed.
However, the current repository of welds must be abandoned,
sorcery on the service box must be updated,
and new welds must be generated.

The bug with weld did not effect all generated source tarballs.
For a few the odd order of chronological order of time stamps
gave the installed autotools reason to attempt re-installation.
If the source tarballs for the spell are removed
and complete source tarballs downloaded
then the previous compile error can not manifest.

Both the bugs with the immutable feature and welding
amounts to minor inconveniences rather serious problems.
Ignoring the problems instead of investigating eventually
results in the same outcome.
The situation will correct itself over time.
Even source tarballs that would not compile after welding
eventually will become obsolete when a newer source tarball
becomes available.
And so the problem fades into history.

I was considering mention to announce the achievement,
but since I already began an email to the list
I want to commence another round of applause for Evert.
He investigated and fixed blender!
And now we can enjoy mixed drinks
or 3D meshes or something.

I rarely have time to make a pet from a non critical software project.
And so spells that gain the broke trait might keep it for a long time.
However, I also vanquished one of those recently.
I discovered that caribou seems to be an elect requirement
for gnome-shell if the gnome-shell's configure script
is not allowed to exit upon failure to detect installed caribou.
If this works as expected then we can again run
the gnome desktop environment,
but without the the onscreen keyboard.
However, I have not allocated time to runtime check it.
Anyone is invited to report whether it actual works.

If the new gnome-shell and blender spells have not arrived
then please relax because they are in route.
Berlios's svn server might not appreciate the barrage
of access while the three catalog methods access it concurrently.
I adjusted the order of those scripts to help ensure
that the current method for providing the catalog which
is the individual spell method receives first access.
Berlios servers tend to have anti- denial of service mechanisms
in nearly every conceivable place.
I might be ringing the alarm bell daily.  :)
