Of course I concur.
Every aspect of the sorcery tools
can be modified by editing /etc/sorcery/config.
However, because it can be modified
is not necessarily sufficient reason to modify it.

About a decade or so we also were
somewhat excited about compiler optimization.
And then more recently it was about link time optimization.
However, testing revealed that there was as much to gain
as to lose from enabling it.
Such things are not clear benefits.
I can give detailed examples.
However, in this rare situation I will omit doing so unless requested.

&quot;There comes a time, thief, when the jewels cease to sparkle,
when the gold loses its luster, when the throne room becomes a prison,
and all that is left is a father's love for his child.&quot;
Ha, wait, no that's from the 1982 movie &quot;Conan the Barbarian.&quot;

There comes a time when the micromanagement loses its luster.
And the POSIX becomes the like a subordinate SA.
And all that is left is for the SA to do the tasks
that require the skills of a SA such as
editing configuration files for Apache httpd or
editing configuration files for Berkeley Internet Name Domain.
*chuckles*  :)

With that said SAs are not encouraged to micromanage.
Doing so merely invites in possibilities for bugs
that would not be surmised when a bug report is submitted.
Therefore, all extraordinary modifications should be reported
along with bug reports when seeking help.
Typically, the less extraordinary the modifications
then the more extraordinary the performance.

There is one exemption.
If desired the selected processor governor can be performance.
I use it from time to time.
However, many of us tend to use the ondemand governor.
That allows frequency of processors to be scaled up when demand exists.
However, the adjustment is not instant.
Performance is lost while using ondemand.
However, power is conserved and less heat is produced.

Not many of us dare to allow our computers
to hibernate to RAM or hibernate to disk.
Typically, hibernate to disk requires special provision
for a sufficiently large swap partition during deployment.
So the next best thing to do before logging out of a workstation
or locking the screen is to switch to the powersave governor.
At a command line type
# cpufreq
then press tab twice for a list of governors.

If the frequency for processors is desired
then at any time run:
$ grep MHz /proc/cpuinfo

# grep MHz /proc/cpuinfo
cpu MHz         : 3000.000
cpu MHz         : 3000.000
cpu MHz         : 800.000
cpu MHz         : 800.000

Something like that might not be uncommon
for the ondemand governor.
And it could change to something else
in less than a second.

If we want to adjust performance
then utilization of CPU frequency and governors
tends to be how we do it these days.

BTW, do not feel obliged to use my program
to adjust the governors and frequency.
The files can be accessed directly
within the /sys/ hierarchy.
They are somewhere within there.
Might require using find and grep to locate.
However, the greatest amount of flexibility
is provided by adjusting them directly.
The cpufreq program is merely a convenience tool.
