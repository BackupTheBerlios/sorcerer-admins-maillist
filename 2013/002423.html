<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>For a while now I have been wondering how to scratch a certain itch.
That itch is how to easily log into one of various root file systems
using a virtual console.
And also itchy, but less so, was the desire to use more than a few,
even more than 12 virtual consoles.
Consequently, I researched it.

Writing my own getty type program would require about 4 ioctl function calls,
which makes the task less than suitable for bash.
However, I discovered that kbd provides programs that will invoke
these required function calls.
Hurray for that.
So I was able to create something like a getty that is a BASH script.

What I created was a tty daemon, or ttyd for short,
that provides a root selection prompt on a virtual console.
The person at the keyboard selects which root.
Then /bin/login is executed chrooted within the selected root.
And now the person can attempt to log into that root.

That scratches the first itch of creating something like a getty
which allows selection of a root file system
and then chroot into it before running /bin/login
One might expect that functionality to already exist,
but apparently it does not.
Perhaps not many people have boxes with multiple root file systems?

The implementation also scratches the second itch.
Who already knew that linux provides by default up to 64 virtual consoles?
Right, that is already evident from /dev/tty*
However, not many people create an /etc/inittab that runs 64 gettys.
And I did not want that either.
I only want two gettys specified in /etc/inittab and launched by /sbin/init
The first getty logs into /media/root/real/
And the second getty logs into /  &lt;-- the rootfs.
I want that much because ttyd is launched as a service during sysinit
and the slight probability exists that for some reason or another
ttyd does not start or malfunctions.
So always good to have a backup method for launching gettys.
Of course a box can be fixed even if it launches no gettys,
but not many SAs might realize what to do in that situation.

So does ttyd launch a getty on all 64 virtual consoles.
Not at all.
Does ttyd launch a getty on a virtual console already being used by
another program?
Not at all.
ttyd will launch a getty on the first available virtual console.
The moment that root selection is made
then ttyd launches a getty on the first available virtual console.
Consequently, gettys are only launched at the moment required
to ensure that another virtual console is available for login.

Periodically, about once per hour or whenever a new getty is started
then kbd's deallocvt is invoked.
That allows linux to reclaim memory in use by unused virtual consoles
and therefore deactivate virtual consoles.
It is also useful for removing the blanks in between activate virtual consoles.

For those who are wondering, I do not select virtual consoles by pressing
alt F1, alt F2, alt F3 and so forth.
Instead I hold the alt key down and tap arrow or right arrow keys
in order to cycle through active virtual consoles.
That way I can visit all 64 virtual consoles if I am using that many.

I realize that some people are thinking,
&quot;This is pointless because I use pts instead of tty and a virtual
terminal emulation program.&quot;
Certainly that is one way to have many login sessions.
However, running X, a window manager, and possibly a desktop environment
can consume a considerable amount of memory.

I realize that some people are thinking,
&quot;I wish he would re-enable back buffering video memory to allow virtual consoles
to retain more than the displayed amount of lines when switching back and forth
among virtual consoles.&quot;
Since unused virtual consoles can now be deactivated
I considered that might be worthy functionality.
And besides the amount of RAM used to back buffer a virtual console
is almost insignificant compared to the amount of installed RAM on a
typical box.
However, apparently that functionality was dropped from the linux kernel.
Consequently, if back buffering of the virtual console is desired
then a program such as screen must be run.
And screen itself is a rather nifty program because
it will allow up to 64 concurrent shell sessions.

The new spell is called ttyd.
I wanted something that did not require /etc/inittab
to be manually adjusted
for selecting virtual consoles and roots where gettys run,
and could also provide the capacity of utilizing
all of the virtual consoles that linux will provide.
I am uncertain this implementation is best,
but it at least scratches those two itches
and works as a starting point.

Those who want to use ttyd should cast it,
do all the updates that are pending because
some additional software must have it's install locations
adjusted so that it's programs become available on the initramfs.
Then adjust /etc/inittab as desired.
Then the next time the box boots ttyd should be able to run.
Remember to leave at least two two gettys in /etc/inittab
such as the getty for real and rootfs running.
That way if ttyd fails to start
then login via virtual console will still be possible.

Please remember that using terminal emulators
such as xterm, konsole, gnome-terminal
utilize pts instead of tty and is entirely separate from virtual consoles.
However, X will run on one of the virtual consoles.
Or if X is started within more than one root or kdm and gnome
are started with in the same root
then X might be running on one or more virtual consoles.

Now for one last nifty trick.
A fast method to gain a bash shell running on another virtual console
is to type openvt -l /bin/bash
But that probably only works correctly if EUID is root.

Hope everyone has fun getting virtual with consoles.
