<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>More exciting useful functionality is arriving with sorcery scan.
Foremost as the name indicates; it provides scanning.
Scanning provides verification of integrity and existence
for significant spell installed files.
If the outcome of scanning is Fail Scan
then the spell is added to load and moil queues
so that it can be re-installed.
This helps protect against both accidental modification and file corruption.

Scanning of important files per installed spell is I/O intensive.
Therefore, scanning happens no more frequently
than once per boot or once per day.
Running # augur begin
either directly or tacitly also begins scanning.
Scan runs as a sorcery utility that avoids competition for I/O
with other potentially I/O intensive utilities such as:
lade; post; reap; rush; save; sign; till.
Therefore, it's utilization of I/O should not cause a performance to
decline.

Also scanning of spell installed files attempts
to avoid deluging the kernel's block cache.
That way scanning concurrently with moiling
should mitigate additional cycles delegated to waiting
while ensuring that the file content being checked
is retrieved from a block device
rather than being provided by the kernel's block cache.

The scan utility of sorcery deprecates the usefulness
of the spell: immune-exam-scan.
The spell with the solo trait required both time and resources
to accomplish it's task no more frequently than weekly.
In contrast the opportunity to more frequently scan spell installed files
via the scan sorcery utility provides faster detection and remedy
of potential problems involving installed spells.

Root file systems that are updated weekly instead of daily
will be running scans weekly instead of daily.
Consequently, most fixed disks will not receive additional
stress and utilization beyond what is currently expected
when the spell immune-exam-integrity is installed.

With that much written, perhaps I seem excited about scanning?
Actually, I am glad to have the functionality re-integrated with sorcery.
It fully benefits from the modular task delegated design
of the modern sorcery utilities.

However, I am excited about something new
which I call spell ownership of files.
I began using Linux when the maximum amount of UID was 2^16.
I knew it would increase someday, but I failed to pay attention.
Linux always provides plenty of new and exciting features to entice
attention.
However, it did increase.
It is now 2^32.
For most forms of utilization 2^32 seems tiny.
It is approximately 4 billion which is not unimaginably large as compared
to 2^64 which is the typical size of registers for most of our CPUs.
Even so 4 billion is plenty large when compared
to the amount of user accounts typically provided on a root file system.
It was large enough for me to consider that plenty of space
would remain available if spells were allowed
to own the files that spells installed.

The idea sounds good thus far, does it not?
The only few exceptions would be files that require
a special user or group ownership and that perhaps also have
the SUID or GUID bits set.
And some other additional exceptions would exist.
However, primarily most files are ownership 0:0 mode 644 or 755
The file's UID ownership could be 0 or any other number provided
that number is not assigned to a user account.
Consequently, I decided to allot the upper 2^20th potential UIDs to sorcery.
That grants approximately a million UIDs to sorcery utilization.
That might seem small, especially compared to 4 billion,
but a million is more than sufficient.

For the sake of mitigating kernel RAM utilization;
the ownership of those UIDs are not recorded in /etc/{group,passwd} files.
I briefly considered the idea and decided that the convenience
of having ownership displayed when invoking ls -la is unworthy
of the cost in caching /etc/passwd and resolving the number
to name association when utilities request it.
Consequently, the ownership is not recorded there,
but instead recorded in file /aux/log/own
That way if a file exists and seems to be an alien
then the UID of the file resolved with the help of /aux/log/own
might reveal the name of the spell and it's version which installed the
file.
That is a potential exciting way of identifying aliens
especially when old Pass Post event logs were disposed.
And the truly mysterious aliens would be those
which have a UID ownership of 0 rather than a UID
within the spell owned range.

The idea of expressing ownership with the installation of a file
has been on my mind for a considerable time.
Originally, I wanted to implement the functionality using
the extended attribute system provided for EXT and XFS file systems.
However, extended attributes are not supported on all file systems.
And extended attributes create an additional invisible file
that utilizes additional disk space.
I forgot the amount of utilization.
However I determined that extended attributes
utilized excessive file system space
when granting extended attributes for every spell installed file.

Fortunately, the re-purposing of the UID ownership of a file
provides nearly full functionality while at the same time
mitigating additional file system space utilization.
The one drawback is the necessity of an uncorrupted
mapping file to resolve the association between UIDs
and the spell name and version which installed it.

The new spell ownership of installed files is enabled by the &quot;own&quot; feature.
Those who dislike the idea can omit enabling the feature.
Newly deploy root file systems where the SA has not selected
a feature set will have the &quot;own&quot; feature enabled by default.
That is because the feature is better to enable than to not have.

Since I was excited about the new &quot;own&quot; feature I implemented it.
I have not yet implemented an augur command that allows a SA
to display the ownership of a file based upon the UID of the file
and the information contained in the map.
However, the thought is on my mind.

My hope is that the mapping information will become more useful
for the task of automatic disposal of aliens.
Eventually, I plan to upgrade the init-script that allows
aliens to be discovered and for the SA to select
a disposition for those aliens such as to allow the alien to remain
by granting a visa or to deport the alien to a location that resides
outside of PATH and library directories specified in /etc/ld.so.conf
Ideally, I want for most aliens to be automatically disposed of
when the origin of the alien can be discovered by examining the map file.
That way the most mysterious aliens will be those that arrived
by a means other than posting such as a file created
during the EUID 0 execution of a process.

Probably since I wrote the init-script
that allows for selecting the disposition of aliens
the assumption could be that I appreciate it's interface.
Actually, it is cumbersome lengthy to process.
It is only barely adequate for accomplishing the task.
That is a motivation for wanting for automatic disposal
of a majority of alien files that are obviously
not spell owned nor expected configuration files for spells.

Consequently, I am open to suggestions.
I expect that we all want a comfortable level of maintained
security and integrity for our root file systems.
Unessential aliens should be deported or deleted.
Corrupted or unintentionally modified files should be replaced
by spell installed files.
A reasonably amount of file system integrity verification
helps ensure that any exploits are utilized to bore passage
into a root file system will most likely be quickly and automatically sealed
soon after the vulnerable software is updated.
Any root file system that is not locked down securely within a tomoyo domain
becomes potentially vulnerable to unauthorized modification.
However, anything that is not specifically designed to thwart sorcery
methods
should at least be detected and remedied soon enough.
Therefore, Sorcerer SAs can rest
with slightly less concern and anxiety each night.

So in summary, scanning runs concurrently with # augur begin.
Seeing plenty of additional disk activity during an update?
Do not be alarmed.
That helps ensure that installed files are commensurate
with expectations derived from reading the log files.

Want to put a meager range of that 2^20 UIDs to good use
and to be able to identify aliens that somehow escaped reaping?
Then enable the &quot;own&quot; feature by executing
# augur feature own

After the &quot;own&quot; feature has been granted significant use
such as the creation of a new utility or a new duty for scan
that automatically deports or disposes of aliens on a weekly basis
then the &quot;own&quot; feature might be removed in favor of mandatory functionality.
For the moment the feature provides a technology demonstration.
The potential usefulness is up for discussion.

The implementation is sleek.
If the feature is enabled
then the additional duration for post will be insignificant.
Mostly find runs and some files are chowned.
Very simple, right?
Finally, glad to have this in the open.
Evert has read about my desire for it
in several emails and until recently
I always reject an implementation because
the costs outweigh the potential benefits.
But now something good can come from it.
I want to use it for alien hunting.
However, I am also eager to listen to
other potential uses for it.

I realize some might want for functionality
that could potentially deprecate the necessity of a log file.
However, scanning the entire root file system for files that
are owned by a specific UID is not at all quickly accomplished.
In fact each directory accessed while scanning a file system
is entirely tantamount to reading the content of a file.
And while a modern computer has sufficient RAM
to cache all the dentries
that task might not be the  best use of the kernel's block cache.

Consequently, the utilization of UID or even extended attributes
is not designed to replace log files.
However, the ability to determine something about a file's origin
from both a log file and from examining the file is a tantalizing idea.

For the moment the use of log files might seem antiquated.
And I partially expect that in some distant future the idea
might become deprecated.
However, for the moment log files provide information
that can be accessed faster and requires less disk space to store
as opposed to using extended attributes and all other methods
that I have recently considered.

As usual please pardon my verbosity.
I express the ideas as they appear to be
rather than providing a succinct synopsis that
is most appropriate for a SA's understanding and utilization.
I do so to entice discussion and encourage relevant ideas to be voiced.

I hope everyone can appreciate that sorcery is evolving
into a utility that provides a very comprehensive level
of source based administration.
And while the functionality is improving the resource utilization is
decreasing.
By now SAs who were interested in the changes have received
an opportunity to examine the new style of post logs.
Approximately 5% of the post logs for a workstation exceed 4 kilobytes.
That means the majority of the post logs
utilize the minim block size
and therefore can not be fragmented.
And if a root file system has approximately 512 spells installed
then the utilization for the post logs requires approximately
2 megabytes of file system space.
That is a good compromise.
Not everyone is pleased about low file system utilization overhead
especially when disks come measured in terabytes.
However, I am pleased with the sleek utilization
which allows fast indexing and the majority of file system space
to be allocated to the task of providing the programs we use and require.

Post logs is not new functionality.
By now all deployed boxes should have converted to post logs.
The above paragraph is merely me enjoying a hearty boast.
2013 is more than nearly a quarter from completion
and yet already sorcery utilities
and even the types of possible deployments
have evolved considerably from 2012 expectations.
Enough was accomplished that already
more is forgotten than can be recalled.
Therefore, we can already raise or glasses
and toast another productive year.

Those who want to promote ideas should do so sooner rather than
later.December will be the month where the development focus
is almost entirely upon additional improvements and refinements
concerning the I/R and the deployment docent.
December will also be the month when newer glibc and newer make are tested.
Yes we know it exist and we are sitting on those updates
because of their importance and the consequence that arise
from updating the current version of glibc or the current version of make.
Both critically important software projects.

Hope everyone is having as good a 2013.
And that is what is new and available soon.
