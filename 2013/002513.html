Changing no; abandoning the previous theme yes.
Words for the queues and task delegated utilities come from
English words that have no immediate relationship or theme.
However, researching each word in a dictionary provides a clue
as to what the utility does.

<A HREF="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/till">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/till</A>

&gt;<i>From the above URL,
</I>&quot;To prepare (land) for the raising of crops,
as by plowing and harrowing; cultivate.&quot;

What might till do then if not actually preparing land?
Till untars source tarballs and prepares /aux/run/source/$TECHNIC/

<A HREF="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/moil">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/moil</A>

moil becomes synonymous a verb that would mean to do the hard work.
Most of the processor intensive tasks involving source based management
is the compilation of source and linking of object files.
That is what moil does.

<A HREF="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mull">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mull</A>

It is a simple word that means to consider something.
The moil/mull and reap/mull subqueues are for what purpose?
Until # au begin
The content of mull subqueues is not acted upon by the utilities.
Therefore, the mull subqueues allow the SA to edit/remove
queued items before approving the remainder for action.
Although irregular a SA might be setting spells in the mull
subqueues while the main queues are already filled
and being processed by the utilities.
Therefore, the mull subqueues grant the SA an opportunity
to consider and act before the utilities begin processing
the spells in the mull subquques.

The output from
# au help queues

provides much of the same information in a succinct format.

Consider the common word &quot;rush.&quot;
How might the rush queue and utility expedite processing of technic?
Exactly, it handles what amounts to tilling
a tarball of previously saved ccache generated files.

The delegation of tasks to various queues and utilities
allows such tasks to be completed at the most opportune moments.
Therefore, in many instances mull will not be waiting
for a technic to be tilled or rushed because those events
happened while moil was moiling a different technic.
Likewise mull might not be waiting for technic to be
reaped, signed, and posted because mull can begin
on a technic that is not being blocked while waiting
for a required technic to post.
The one exception, of course, are technic with the solo trait.

Knowing all the queues is not important.
Knowing 2 major queues and 2 sub queues suffices.

Having something like a dozen queues for providing
the pinnacle in performance might seem like unwarranted complexity.
But that is what is required to balance performance and resource
consumption on modern computers with more than 4 processors.
And instead of trying to provide only a simple interface for the queues
I did not hide information about the queues and their relevant utilities.
The utilities do not do anything sneaky.

Did the toolset's complexity increase?
Complexity increased at a rate proportional to the increase
in complexity and performance of modern computers.
The sorcery from 4 to 5 years ago was fine for use on
uniprocessor computers and manageable for use on SMP.
However, EruditeTechnic is required for harnessing
the available performance of large scale SMP computers
and modern workstations for the task of providing software.

If the magic theme was maintained
then what would the delegated utilities be called?
&quot;conflagrate&quot; &quot;ice storm?&quot;
The magical theme sufficed for a dinky toolset.
