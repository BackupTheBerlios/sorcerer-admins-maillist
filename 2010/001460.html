<PRE>&gt;<i> will try if needed, but it still boots ok, but when boot is done and when i
</I>&gt;<i> can login to system, its missing /dev/sda, sdb and md0, but udev has managed
</I>&gt;<i> todo other devices ok afaik... so i dont rule out that current boot
</I>&gt;<i> procedure with current init-scripts causes this because i dont use modular
</I>&gt;<i> kernel spell.
</I>
In theory using a monolithic custom kernel without initrmfs to boot
should still work.
However, in practice it receives no testing anymore.
Since you can boot your box and
then make temporary repairs
then if I were you I would try using one or two versions
of udev that are older than current to see if
the problem might indeed be caused by udev.
Because your disk controller drives are compiled
into the kernel and not modules
udev might not handle them as a cold plug event
and therefore might not create device nodes for them,
because no modules have to be loaded.

I also agree that the problem might be caused by
a Sorcerer init-script.
However, I tend to be more suspicious of udev.

The problem should be identified and properly fixed.
However, if one were to circumvent it for convenience
then those missing device nodes could be added to
/lib/udev/dev/
Then they would be copied into /dev upon boot.
This is not a proper solution.
It merely circumvents the problem of not having
/dev/sd* device nodes during boot.


&gt;<i> I might actually pray for devtmpfs, <A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/330985/">http://lwn.net/Articles/330985/</A> ,
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/331818/">http://lwn.net/Articles/331818/</A> , <A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/370418/">http://lwn.net/Articles/370418/</A>
</I>
I also read about the resurgence of interest in devfs or devtmpfs.
Indeed it does create device nodes for hardware
whether the driver is compiled into the kernel or loaded as a module.
However, devtmpfs is not in any way useful for booting
using a modular kernel and initramfs,
because something must load modules in proper order.
That something is udev.
Also udev has rules in order to give device nodes
proper ownership and permission.
devtmpfs might not have that yet.


&gt;<i> Could that be activated and then delete udev?
</I>
That requires more than a minute's worth of consideration.
I played with it briefly before and
then decided to stick with udev and tmpfs for /dev
However, I do not remember my reason for that decision,
and I did not write notes about the experiement.
I was merely curious to see what would appear in /dev/


&gt;<i> I hate udev, it sucks big time.
</I>
The udev idea is great, the implementation sometimes is lacking.

&gt;<i> Why, because its too much kernel version dependent, i mean, old kernel
</I>&gt;<i> and new udev its nogo, then new kernel and old udev, its also nogo, grrrrrr.
</I>
Yes, this is true.
As soon as a new awesome kernel feature
appears for more than a month
then udev wants to start using it.
And generally in the past with the bugs udev had
updating was often better than staying as is.

The coldplug system that I created for replicating
the outcome of previous udev handled coldplug events
I created as a compromise to udev so that it could be used
during boot when udev is being flaky.
It is probably not faster than using devtmpfs
with a monolithic kernel.
However, it can preserve proper ownership and permissions
and it is already tested and works on Sorcerer boxes
that use linux-modular with initramfs.

Whether devtmpfs can be used in place of udev
at least for monoltihic kernels requires a bit more
discussion and consideration.
If implemented incorrectly it either could block
linux-modular boxes from being able to boot properly
or it could be cast accidentally and then cause that problem.
Did you read anything about how node
ownership and permission should be maintained when
using the new devtmpfs?

And what will your box do for hotplug events without udev?
Does it not have any hotplug events?
Can you put in a digital camera and remove it
or a removable SCSI style thumb stick USB memory drive?
Does that work properly without udev to handle the events?
