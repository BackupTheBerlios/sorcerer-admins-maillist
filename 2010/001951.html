<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>The AT power supply on my i586 gave up the ghost.
And I am not in the mood to buy an antique power supply,
since none were for sale last time I went to my local computer store.
Therefore, I no longer have a reliable way of creating i586
Install/Rescue images
that I could expect would be usable on i586
since not all software that compiles uses what is specified in CFLAGS
and CXXFLAGS.
The next set of Install/Rescue disks will be:

ia32-SMP;
ia32-UP;
x86_64.

The IA32-SMP will be PAE enabled and support up to 64M of RAM
and will be bootable on most boxes, but not a Pentium-M.
The Pentium-M is perhaps the only modern microprocessor that lacks PAE.
The IA32-UP, will boot a uni-processor kernel that lacks PAE.
It can use 4G of installed RAM.
It is useful for installing on Pentium-M computers
or computers where something is sufficiently broken
about the BIOS that would prevent using a SMP kernel.
Years ago I had an Athlon that was like that.
It was unusable when booted with APIC support.

So in summary, there will be 3 Install/Rescue disks to select from,
and the minimum computer supported will be the i686 Pentium Pro, hopefully.


Recently, I was trying to get a grip on which microprocessor does what.
And it is way beyond confusing.
Names like &quot;Celeron&quot; and 'Atom&quot; can refer to several generations of
Pentium microprocessors and even now x86_64 enabled microprocessors.
They should have names like 80386 where I can know the difference
between an 80286 and an 80386,
but instead they have meaningless names that prevent
almost anything being inferred about the microprocessors capabilities.

However, I wrote something that might be able to identify the CPU
from /proc/cpuinfo so that the answer can be used to modify linux's .config
in order to compile CPU optimizations for the installed CPU.
That is how the linux spell is now.
Before, it compiled for i586 or generic x86_64
and included optimizations to help it run better other types of microprocessors.
I do not know whether compiling for the exact installed CPU
will boost performance or not.
However, it should be more to the liking of SAs
that would otherwise want to use linux-custom
with a custom created .config.

Anyone who has Sorcerer deployed on i586 can continue using it
provided that they create a custom config or salvage an older config
from one of the linux spells that supports i586.
The linux spell is changed and the next set of I/Rs will be different also.
However, everything else should work much the same as it does now.


Also as a reminder from a previous email
the init-scripts used for fast booting should
run more like they would on a full boot.
Hopefully, this will eliminate all of
the current outstanding problems
involving fast booting.
So any SA who had a problem
is welcome to try a fast boot
to see if the problem persists.
If problems persist
then please provide verbose reports
so that we can chase down those
bugs and properly squish them.
