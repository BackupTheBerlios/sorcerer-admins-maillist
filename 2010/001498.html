<PRE>Because of the size/download requirement of a &quot;Live CD&quot;
and also the fact that Sorcerer is a source based compile
if installed type distribution, Sorcerer does not provide a &quot;Live CD&quot;
We have only an Install/Rescue CD image
for IA32 and x86_64 architecture.

As far as I know they work.
Usually the process is.
Download, burn, boot, login as root using no password,
run sinstall, visit the menus, complete the installation,
reboot, configure networking, raise networking,
do initial set up updates, select software for installation,
wait a few hours and check it see if it is done.

When I test the menu driven installer I do not do a fancy install.
I usually do one or two partitions with ext3 filesystems.
Usually a 1G /boot and the rest for /

The last error reported with the I/R occurred due to
a bu that only showed up when a box also has a
floppy drive installed.
However, almost immediately after that bug was reported
I rolled new I/Rs and uploaded them.
Therefore, they should be ready for download and use.

While I could roll new I/Rs within a few days...
I an contemplating on postponing any new I/R release
until after I write a new kernel config
and after I finish rewriting the server code for the
Public Patch Repository.

Someone might have a step by step guide for
navigating the install menus, but I only write the
menu driven installer.
Hopefully, on the next release of it
I will have added more documentation
directly into the installer that helps explain
in detail how each menu works.
Already I wrote a generic dialog tutorial
that will help new SAs learn how to use dialog
to make choices and input information.

If anyone spots a bug during the process of
booting and using the menu driven installer
then please report it for a prompt fix.
If no bugs are reported
then the next release of the I/R
becomes a low priority item that will be delayed
often until after a newer glibc is released.
Currently, the I/R is the lowest priority item in the todo list
and that is why I have not yet written and tested improvements
to the menu driven install program that I described above.

Because I do not test the I/R on the thousands of possible
hardware combinations; I rely upon bug reports in order to
make fixes and improvements to it.
I of course do limited testing on the I/R each time using qemu.
Therefore, whatever is currently available for download
is expected to work.
Please give it a try.
If bugs are encountered please report the bugs.
And the shifts the I/R back to high priority on the todo list.

Currently, top priority is the testing and release of KDE version 4.4.1
So far the probability for it going out in the next
LAG=0 grimoire is looking good.

I know there are a few live distro available.
Ubuntu might still be a live distro.
But I am not knowledgeable enough to
make a recommendation about what distro to use.
The closest that Sorcerer will become to a live CD distro
is to install Sorcerer onto a USB thumb drive.
A 32G thumb drive would be adequate,
but even 16G would do with a limited loadout of software.
Once it is installed on a USB thumb drive it should
be bootable and usable on any computer that has
BIOS that can boot from removable USB media.
Generally, those are computers with motherboards
manufactured on or after 2004.

Good luck in creating a Sorcerer live USB installation
if you want to give that a try.
However, a traditional install to a fixed disk
is still the recommended installation method.
Although disk devices are now mounted according to UUID
which should allow for a live installation of Sorcerer to
be portable and usable among several different computers;
as far as I know this is not tested extensively.
I do not know if anyone carries their Sorcerer box's filesystem
on their keychain to use on multiple computers.  :)
However, with Sorcerer's support for LUKS encrypted filesystems
the possibility for carrying Sorcerer on a keychain yet keeping
all the installed data free from theft and modification
is very good.

&gt;<i> could you please tell me when you have all the bugs worked out of the sorcerer linux live cd download as well as a step by step guide to install it on a formerly windows xp computer as the only operating system? I have already erased all the partitions and xp system and all I need is the bug less live cd to download and a step by step guide to install it on an empty computer.
