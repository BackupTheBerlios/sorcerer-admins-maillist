<PRE>Interesting choice. Personally, I would have thought that a few extra
megs would have been worth having SAMBA, and especially NFS, but then
again, a 200MEG iso is pretty kewl too, considering it all gets
re-compiled anyway.

um... so basically, since NFS is an integral part of any machine base
install from my perspective, following the install I need to enter:

&quot;# cast nfs&quot;

and

&quot;# cast samba&quot; (if I want SAMBA Daemon and SAMBA utils)

right?

</I>&gt;<i> Downloading with current throttling limits requires a lengthy wait.
</I>&gt;<i> Going from an installation with Xorg installed

</I>&gt;<i> It is easier to go from console to Xorg.

</I>&gt;<i> Installed xine was useful only for workstations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I did want to be able to provide more on the I/Rs.
</I>&gt;<i> However, faster downloading, faster burning, faster testing
</I>&gt;<i> tend to influence my decision to slim it down.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Booting the I/R does not require a network connection.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if an I/R consisted only of a kernel and initramfs
</I>&gt;<i> then all the archives could be provided from a httpfs mount
</I>&gt;<i> across the Internet that sort of I/R could be around 50M
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sort of makes it less useful for recovery
</I>&gt;<i> and difficult for installing if the Internet
</I>&gt;<i> connection is slow or tricky to configure.
</I>&gt;<i> However, archives could be provided independently
</I>&gt;<i> from the I/Rs to provide more current installs even
</I>&gt;<i> when using an old I/R
</I>&gt;<i> Yet even so I still prefer having the archives on CD.
</I>&gt;<i> Does everyone feel the same about that?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the long run having a more concise I/R
</I>&gt;<i> will require less testing, less compiling
</I>&gt;<i> and allow for more frequent releases
</I>&gt;<i> of new I/Rs as important changes happen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, I remembered something..
</I>&gt;<i> Someone asked for more manual page and
</I>&gt;<i> manual page support on the I/R
</I>&gt;<i> I am trying to make it happen.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I added a restriction to the I/R
</I>&gt;<i> to ensure that the required archives for
</I>&gt;<i> providing and reading manual pages are only
</I>&gt;<i> untarred provided that enough free RAM exists.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, if the amount of RAM on the target box is sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> then the initramfs is populated with more software
</I>&gt;<i> and manual pages than when testing on a 384M target.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Excluding nfs-utils from the I/R
</I>&gt;<i> also omits the loading of some modules,
</I>&gt;<i> which saves some space.
</I>&gt;<i> Unnecessary modules can also be removed
</I>&gt;<i> from the initramfs by the SA
</I>&gt;<i> if available memory is too tight.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was looking at the capacity of credit card sized CDs.
</I>&gt;<i> 50 megs is still too tiny for Sorcerer I/R
</I>&gt;<i> However, 256M USB memory sticks are faster
</I>&gt;<i> and maybe cheaper than a CDROM + CDROM rewriter.
</I>&gt;<i> Trying to create Sorcerer I/Rs that are less than 256M
</I>&gt;<i> seems like a reasonable goal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Download savings can happen even in advance of updates
</I>&gt;<i> when sources are downloaded from the master source cache.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the benefit of having the SPR,
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer Patch Repository,
</I>&gt;<i> pay off almost exclusively on updates.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, if an initial install requires the downloading
</I>&gt;<i> of sources for Xorg and KDE-v4
</I>&gt;<i> then when those updates happen
</I>&gt;<i> the box can download the xz compressed sdelta3 patches.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, download savings start sooner.
</I>&gt;<i> And a SA might already have archives or sources
</I>&gt;<i> from another Sorcerer box to use and so having
</I>&gt;<i> that software pre-compiled might not be useful.
</I>&gt;<i> However, having a fresh I/R could be useful for
</I>&gt;<i> doing new installs or recovery.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was nervous about the changes.
</I>&gt;<i> But I considered the boons and banes
</I>&gt;<i> and decided that a smaller I/R would be
</I>&gt;<i> more beneficial than detrimental.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I did not do the usual pros and cons type listing.
</I>&gt;<i> I will try to contrast and explain concisely below.
</I>&gt;<i> There are many possibilities for the shape of the I/R.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A. kernel + initramfs + network.
</I>&gt;<i> B. kernel + initramfs + archives on CD.
</I>&gt;<i> C. kernel + with all software in initramfs.
</I>&gt;<i> D. kernel + initramfs + \
</I>&gt;<i>    installed software on CD with rockridge extensions
</I>&gt;<i>    and and zisofs
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A. is nice and tiny, but requires a network.
</I>&gt;<i> B. is medium sized and does not require a network.
</I>&gt;<i> C. is smaller than B. but larger than A. \
</I>&gt;<i> however it requires over a gigabyte of RAM!
</I>&gt;<i> D. is like somewhat like 2007 and earlier I/Rs
</I>&gt;<i> which eventually exceeded CDROM capacity for the x86_64 I/R
</I>&gt;<i> and also makes for a huge download.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> B. is the current compromise.
</I>&gt;<i> It is much larger than A,
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat less efficient than C.,
</I>&gt;<i> but unlike C. requires very little RAM for install.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am tying to provide I/Rs that are useful and not bloated.
</I>&gt;<i> If someone has good reasons
</I>&gt;<i> for why we should use a different design
</I>&gt;<i> then the conversation is still open.
