Are all new and coming very soon to a sorcery near you.

However, the very ancient ppr.silverice.org is being retired.
The new spr ( Sorcerer Patch Repository ) will be excellent
at creating patches for Sorcerer boxes and probably not even
average for finding sources used in other distributions.
Also it is far stripped down as compared to what the ppr was designed to do.
SPR creates and hosts xz compressed patch files for Sorcerer boxes.
That is all it does.
No ftp upload, no email notification, no alternate clients.
It is just simple and effective.

Part of the backend for the SPR is the new
sources.silverice.org
which will also act as a master source cache for Sorcerer boxes.
This should increase the probability of a source being available for download
even when the original software author has moved the source tarball to
a new location.
This would have been nice to have when all the download paths changed
for sources hosted at Sourceforge.
Yet fortunately, now we will have it.

The tarballs hosted at <A HREF="http://sources.silverice.org">http://sources.silverice.org</A>
are arranged in the very nice and logical Sorcerer method
which is the same used for /var/cache/sources/
but without the /var/cache/sources/ path prefix.
Also those tarballs are xz compressed.
Therefore, generally they will be a bit smaller than tarballs
that are available from software author's primary websites.
However, for fast Internet connections
downloading from original hosts
instead of the master source cache
will probably be faster.

That is because all of the new sites are
rate limited, connection limited, bandwidth limited, and generally limited.
This should help ease any problems created by greedy downloaders.
Yet the speed and conveniences that Sorcerer SAs have come to expect
should still be available.

Since most Sorcerer boxes are LAG=1
the changes will happen for them sometime around mid week.
Mostly this will be transparent.
However, SAs that have set a specific order for leech methods
should revisit the sorcery menu and reselect the order for leech methods.
That is because some of the previous methods are no longer available,
while two new methods are now available.
