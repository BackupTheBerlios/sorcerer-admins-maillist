<PRE>gzip -cd tcp_wrappers_7.6.tar.gz | tar --no-same-owner
--no-same-permissions -C /tmp/open -ixf -
tar: Skipping to next header
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors

I do not have an easy solution for that just yet.
The tarball is improper?
This problem seems consistently repeatable with
tar versions 1.23 and 1.22

tcp_wrappers_7.6.tar.gz 	98 KB 	04/08/1997 	12:00:00 AM

Maybe tar worked slightly differently
during the previous millennium?
For the moment...
extract the tarball to a directory.
retar it
replace the tarball in /var/cache/sources/tcp_wrappers/7.6/

Oddly, I am not recalling any similar problems
reported with tcp_wrappers
I have no guesses about when this started happening.

To be very specific about this problem.
cast tries to decompress and untar the source.
tar exits with an error.
cast removes any directories/files created.
cast tries to decompress and untar it again.
tar exits with an error, again.
cast decides that the tarball must be corrupt.
cast removes the tarball from /var/cache/sources.
the spell fails to compile.

My preference is to not use tcp_wrappers with openssh.
tcp_wrappers is an optional requirement.
I intended to remove from the grimoire in 2009.
However, SAs that did not want to set up proper iptables
firewalling rules wanted me to continue including
tcp_wrappers in the grimoire.

I am not treating this as a sorcery bug at this time.
Sorcerer is not responsible for tcp_wrappers tarball nor
download server providing a problematic tarball.

I am not removing the -i from the tar command,
because that solves more problems than it causes.
I would have to retest decompression and extraction
of 4000 sources if I remove the -i

Does anyone want to recommend a substitute for
tcp_wrappers?
There might be one or two stubborn software projects
in the grimoire that will fail to compile without tcp_wrappers.
However, openssh is not one of them.

As I said above
please re-roll the tcp_wrappers tarball
before casting it otherwise cast will remove it from
/var/cache/sources/tcp_wrappers/7.6/
and fail the tcp_wrappers cast attempt.

Sorcerer maintainers did not roll the tcp_wrappers tarball.
The primary hosting is not on Sorcerer servers.
The tarball does not compile out of box
and requires patching prior to compiling.
The original software author should have updated
his source years ago to fix that.

Sorcerer might not be the most ideal place
to report a bug about a tarball rolled 13 years ago.
Then again after 13 years of absolutely no maintenance
who cares if it is buggy, problematic, or a security risks?
You really want to be using tcp_wrappers, yes?
*lol*

# augur forget tcp_wrappers
# cast openssh

When it asks if you want tcp_wrappers as an optional
please say no.

If someone who uses tcp_wrappers wants
for a better solution
then please implement one.
This ancient source is causing more problems than it is worth.
I would prefer to dispose of it.
