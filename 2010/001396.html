<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I have been doing extensive testing on single core
to ensure that workstation performance
is commensurate or better than expected.
Since single core boxes are mostly legacy workstations these days
the performance problems tend to occur during high load
or when at least one process is far too greedy with the CPU
than it aught to be.
Consequently, I have adjusted the jiffies per second to 1000
for i586 single core linux configurations.
What that does is to help keep greedy processes from starving out
other processes.
When playing games in X for example
this will help maintain spontaneous input events while
providing a nice consistent frame rate.
Of course the cost for this optimization is that the kernel will eat a
bit more CPU
compared to the more conservative 300 jiffies per second.
But for the user who plays games and/or video on their workstation
the 1000 jiffies per second will help keep it looking smooth
even when 3/4th of the CPU is also allocated to other tasks.
I know it is strange and counter-intuitive that wasting a bit of CPU
provides visually improved performance.
But the kernel is better able to attend important tasks
without the greedy ones starving X.

The i586 kernel config also has a separate kernel config for SMP, or
multi-core boxes.
And the x86_64 is a SMP only configuration.
These configurations are optimized for raw CPU power.
Consequently, they are tickless.
They jiffy as required depending upon system load.
It should work good for most boxes since at least one core
will have an idle CPU willing and waiting to handle a process.
If anyone has a need for a 1000 jiffies per second SMP configuration
then please explain.

Otherwise I am trying to keep the kernel configs few and simple
where the single cores are the workstations and the SMPs are the servers.
As far as I know jiffies per second is a compile time setting
and can not be adjusted by a kernel boot parameter.
Might be nice if it were.
Even with a -5 nice value a low jiffies per second value can enable
some greedy programs to stave off X creating a low frames per second.
As such it can make decent graphic cards look like a bottleneck
when really only the CPU is over-burdened.
Please consider this if graphic performance seems lacking
when top reports the CPU processing at full bore.

Ah, I forgot to explain what a jiffy is.
A jiffy is a segment of time per second that the CPU
can continuously allocate to a process.
Prior to SMP and multi-core boxes
multitasking was handled,
and to some degree still is handled,
by the kernel interrupting what is happening,
saving registers, and changing the memory map to a different process.
In a way it is like reading one line from a page,
stuffing a bookmark in it, dropping the book,
picking up another book, opening the book to the bookmark,
reading one line, stuffing the bookmark back in, dropping the book, etc...
I know it seems crazy but that is how multiple processes run
concurrently on single processor systems.
