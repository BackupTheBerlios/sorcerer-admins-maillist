<PRE>I am thinking that external documentation is not the best approach.
Instead we should discover exactly
what problems SAs are encountering.
Then, the menu driven installer should be improved
in order to help SAs avoid those errors.

I am adding notes to my todo such as:

&quot;the dialog checklist in the menu driven installer
might be confusing to SAs and requires a more elaborate
help screen?&quot;

I am considering creating a mini-tutorial
that pops up when the sorcerer installer is invoked
that grants new SAs an opportunity to familiarize
with the use of dialog.

I am thinking that the menu driven installer is not a bad tool
for senior level SAs that know how to use dialog and know
what is required in order to manually install a POSIX.
However, I am only beginning to be able to surmise
the problems that completely new SAs are experiencing
with the menu driven installer and using the dialog program.
With so many decades of experience,
I have trouble anticipating what someone who is entirely fresh
might do wrong.
Even when I taught Unix system administration
I was occasionally surprised at some of the things students did.
I somewhat regret now not being able to see that in action.  :)
For the boon of that insight I could probably write much more
noob friendly menu driven interfaces.

I find it a difficult realization to face
yet perhaps that without the skill required for using dialog
then that alone could present an insurmountable obstacle
to successful installation.

This could probably be addressed best by a tutorial
at the beginning of the menu driven installer
instead of with external documentation.
Does that seem so?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, a car analogy:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Getting windows is like getting a car that is beautifully made, but the
</I>&gt;<i> bonnet is welded shut. And all the interesting bits are behind screws with
</I>&gt;<i> funny heads.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, getting Linux from an outfit like Ubuntu or Suse is like
</I>&gt;<i> getting a car that is beautifully made with all the trimmings, and all nuts
</I>&gt;<i> and bolts are standard. You get an owner's manual and a free membership to a
</I>&gt;<i> community that owns similar cars.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer is slightly different. You get a chassis, engine and all the spare
</I>&gt;<i> parts for free, each with their own manual. Basically, you get a kit-car.
</I>&gt;<i> Expect to painstakingly inspect each piece, figure out how it fits in the
</I>&gt;<i> big picture, and you build your own car. So, expect to get your hands dirty,
</I>&gt;<i> expect your car to blow up a few times and you won't be disappointed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After some time you will know a LOT more about how computers actually work,
</I>&gt;<i> you will be able to repair ANY linux distro, and you will be able to mutter
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;What the hell were these fools thinking when they did foo bar&quot; under your
</I>&gt;<i> breath... Like any true Sorcerer. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the beginning....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Computers stored stuff on punched cards, and all were happy. Progress being
</I>&gt;<i> what it is, we got magnetic storage in tapes and soon after that on disks,
</I>&gt;<i> both hard and soft. Storage areas increased exponentially, and some way of
</I>&gt;<i> organizing this modern babel was needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Enter the humble file system. A file system is nothing more than a index for
</I>&gt;<i> a computer to store and retrieve information effectively.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is always a good idea to separate operating system and user data, and
</I>&gt;<i> with the increase in file storage size, we devised a way of getting more
</I>&gt;<i> than one file system on a storage device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Enter the humble partition and partition creating tools. These days you will
</I>&gt;<i> be hard pressed to find a better command-line partition manager than cfdisk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently (2010) ext3 is the tried and tested file system for Linux, and not
</I>&gt;<i> a bad place to start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, without further ado, we can get the Sorcerer Install underway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I assume you already have downloaded and burned to CD-ROM an ISO of the
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer Install/Rescue disk that is suited to your platform.
</I>&gt;<i> Put this in your CD-ROM drive, and boot from it. You might have to modify
</I>&gt;<i> the boot order in your computer's BIOS to do this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once the Sorcerer disk has completed booting, you will be dropped at a
</I>&gt;<i> command prompt with a short instruction on where the installer is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step 1.)(Initial Setup)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Run the installer, and go through the menus in order.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step 2.)(Partitioning)
</I>&gt;<i> When you come to the partition disk menu, select cfdisk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In cfdisk, you will most likely be accessing your primary hard disk as
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/sda
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Erase all the partitions that is there, and create a primary partition of
</I>&gt;<i> about 30GB (30000 mb)
</I>&gt;<i> Mark this partition as bootable. In this example it will be /dev/sda1 ( If
</I>&gt;<i> you are using the older IDE interface, it will be /dev/hda1 )
</I>&gt;<i> Then make a partition spanning the rest of the hard disk. This will be
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/sda2
</I>&gt;<i> Write the partitions to disk.
</I>&gt;<i> If you deleted any windows partitions, I highly recommend a reboot at this
</I>&gt;<i> time. ( Windows partitions mess with the BIOS more often than not )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step 3.)(Partition Table)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once you are back in the Sorcerer Installer, make a partition table.
</I>&gt;<i> The mount point on /dev/sda1 should read: /
</I>&gt;<i> (/ is the UNIX shortcut for root. There is no Windows analogy for this. Root
</I>&gt;<i> is the highest up you can go in your system, and the rest of the world
</I>&gt;<i> attaches to it somehow. It's your base, and it's where the operating system
</I>&gt;<i> lives. )
</I>&gt;<i> On the file system type you should have: ext3
</I>&gt;<i> Leave the rest as default.
</I>&gt;<i> Next define the mount point for /dev/sda2
</I>&gt;<i> This should read: /home
</I>&gt;<i> All your user data goes here. Same as the other file system , choose type
</I>&gt;<i> ext3, leave the rest as defaults.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step 4.)(Formatting)
</I>&gt;<i> Tell Sorcerer to format your partitions, and say yes to the questions about
</I>&gt;<i> losing your data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step 5.)(Mounting)
</I>&gt;<i> Make sure Sorcerer has mounted your partitions where you specified.
</I>&gt;<i> If this did not happen, something went wrong. Investigate... You might have
</I>&gt;<i> to go to the command line, and format/mount yourself.
</I>&gt;<i> You must have at least these two entries from the mount command.
</I>&gt;<i> /&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ext3 /dev/sda1
</I>&gt;<i> /home&#160;&#160; ext3 /dev/sda2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step 6.)(Transferring Files)
</I>&gt;<i> Transfer the operating system to it's new root. This should be automatic via
</I>&gt;<i> the installer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step 7.)(Writing the MBR)
</I>&gt;<i> Now you have the oppertunity to modify the fstab ( Don't ) and run lilo. The
</I>&gt;<i> correct place to write the MBR to is /dev/sda
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Step8.)(Unmount Filesystems)
</I>&gt;<i> Unmount your filesystems, and reboot. Remove the installer disk from the
</I>&gt;<i> CD-ROM drive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Upon boot, you should now have the basic Sorcerer running. Connecting to a
</I>&gt;<i> network and Fine tuning shall be covered in another Mail.
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> -Evert-
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kyle, do you think it may be worth our while to make an install guide that
</I>&gt;<i> completely bypasses the installer script?
</I>&gt;<i> ie: boot I/R
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> cfdisk /dev/sda, (make partitions.)
</I>&gt;<i> mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda1 (format partitions.)
</I>&gt;<i> mount /dev/sda1 /media/root (Mount partitions)
</I>&gt;<i> cp -vpdfR /media/cd-rom /media/root (Copy the filesystem)
</I>&gt;<i> chroot /media/root (Change over to the new filesystem )
</I>&gt;<i> ldconfig (Update the config )
</I>&gt;<i> nano /etc/lilo.conf ( Make sure lilo is set up properly )
</I>&gt;<i> lilo ( Run lilo, update the MBR)
</I>&gt;<i> exit
</I>&gt;<i> umount /media/root
</I>&gt;<i> reboot
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also... we need a troubleshooting guide. I remember having LOTS of fun
</I>&gt;<i> trying to mount my CD-ROM drive because it was too slow to be recognized on
</I>&gt;<i> boot, and making all those nodes, etc...
