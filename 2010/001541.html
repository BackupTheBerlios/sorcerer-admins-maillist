<PRE>Hi Kyle,

pls see comments below...

&gt;<i> The device entry at the top of the menu
</I>&gt;<i> is only for SAs to use if they know that the device
</I>&gt;<i> they want is not already listed on the menu
</I>&gt;<i> and they are absolutely certain that they know
</I>&gt;<i> what they want will work and not fail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or it is to confuse SA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Take your pick.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
LOL!

Well I guess it could be said that w/o an installation manual it serves to
confuse the SA ;)

I've got a pretty firm grip on it now, however. Thanks for the
clarification, and I'll make sure to elaborate on the distinctive features
in the installation manual.

On that note, however, this little personal project of mine is indeed
growing, and quickly becoming not just an installation manual, but a user
manual as well.

It's starting to take shape, if not yet form, but the gathering of
important and crucial system features and the Sorcerer philosophy is
indeed becoming a cohesive, yet not quite comprehensive document.

How does it look so far?

&lt;snip&gt;

This file is the Sorcerer Notes doc that I use for assembling the Sorcerer
manual.

Many of these notes are gathered from dialogs with Kyle Sallee, his posts
on the <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sorcerer-admins">sorcerer-admins at lists.berlios.de</A> email discussion list or other
contributors, as well as my own observations and discoveries.

Eventually, this should become a comprehensive manual discussing the
ins/outs of installing, operating, and maintaining Sorcerer.

Who knows? perhaps Sorcerer will eventually even become a kernel
independant OS in its own right, based on the Sorcerer philosopy, enabling
the option of other really kewl kernels and filesystems, like HAMMER FS
and DragonFly's kernel too!

Okay enough ranting to myself...

----------------------BeginDoc----------------------------------------------

Concerning virtual RAM and Swap files, and partitions:

I.)	RAM and SWAP space as it pertains to various Sorcerer Architectures:

There are slight differences in swapping on IA32 and x86_64 boxes. the
size of virtual memory pages (swap space) are significantly different
between the 32 bit architecture and the 64 bit architecture.

IA32 can swap at minimum 4K of memory to disk, while the x86_64
architecture swaps a minimum of 64K sized pages of memory to disk.

Therefore, swapping tends to be less fragmented and faster on x86_64
boxes. However, x86_64 boxes under memory duress are not able to swap as
much memory to disk as IA32 machines.

Therefore, the recommendations are that only IA32 be configured with a
small amount of RAM, and that x86_64 boxes have at least 3G or more RAM
installed.

Basic memory requirements for the server's role in the form 'RAM + 1G of
swap space' typically provides excellent coverage for compiling all but
the most demanding compile time applications without exhibitin any
significant impact on system performance.

To make it simple, we recommend the following virtual memory
configurations as a general starting point:

1 GigaBytes of swap space if the box has &gt; 4G of RAM
2 GigaBytes of swap space if the box has &lt; 4G of RAM

The Sorcerer SA must make allowances for some additional memory that will
be required and used during updates, otherwise, the SA might need to
change to runlevel S or 1 and terminate various services during updates in
order to avoid performance degradation.

Sorcerer machines are intended to maintain nearly uninterrupted up-time of
services while updating. Therefore, it is important to have each
particular Sorcerer installation configured with adequate memory in the
form of RAM + SWAP.

The following explains the basics of Sorcerer's virtual memory model,
specifically in relation to the temp filesystems (tempfs).

/root/.sorcery/ is tmpfs - It will normally have about 64M to 128M on it.
It is swappable and thus can be freed from RAM when it is not in use.

/usr/src/sorcery/ is tmpfs - It will normally have less than 128M of
usage, but is allowed up to 3G of memory. The only time /usr/src/sorcery/
requires a large amount of memory is for compiling software such as
firefox, QT, X, etc.

In such cases  additional system resources over that of normal operations
is desirous to avoid impacting system performace. Remember, Sorcerer
machines are designed to regularly perform system updates (including
compile time of newly installed sources) without interuption of system
services.

II.)	Sorcerer System Boot

  A.) 	Boot logs:

Sorcer system bootlogs are not located in the typical location expected by
systems administrators coming from other Linux distributions.

Logfiles created during the boot sequence of a Sorcerer machine are
written to /etc/init.d/log.d instead of /var/log. This is because
/var/log/ doesn't exist on an initramfs (older distributions used initrd,
the init RAM disk, instead of the newer initramfs, the init RAM file
system, which has largely supplanted the use of initrd on modern Linux
distributions).

Following system boot and the mounting of of the filesystem on disk, the
tempfs located at /etc/init.d/log.d is simply moved to the root filesystem
&quot;/&quot; located on disk, which does not require additional actions by the
system such as a copy or a write of those files to /.

This saves both time and additional wear and tear on the disk as a result
of the additional tasks required to write the logs to /var/log/.

    B.) Sorcerer's /etc/.ori/ tree

Also unique to Sorcerer is the /etc.ori/ tree, which is basically the same
set of files one would expect in /etc/, except that the files in /etc.ori/
remain unmodified from the files created during the original Sorcerer
installation.

/etc.ori/ uses only a nomimal amount of space, and allows the Sorcerer SA
to easily &quot;un-customize&quot; system configuration files, reverting back to the
state of the system during the original Sorcerer installation.

The advantages are obvious to any systems administrator that has had to
comb through archived backup images on tape searching for original and
unmodified system files.

The common practice of using rc or appending the original configuration
files with, for example, '-orig', can be considered a deprecated practice
on Sorcerer machines.

    C.) Modification of Init Scripts and Configuration Files

Consider for a moment that since Sorcerer is a source based operating
system, and that regular updates to a running system require at times
considerable changes to certain configuration files to accommodate system
updates, many critical files in /etc/init.d are not treated as regular
configuration files and manual editing methods are not allowed.

This is not to say that you can't actually edit them, however, this can
break a Sorcer system when an update occurs. What the SA needs to consider
is that Sorcerer 'Spells' to update the system control the maintenance and
modification of these configuration files and therefore, the SA needs to
create a new spell to affect the modification to respective configuration
files.

This provides the original spell and also installs what the SA requires
for his/her particular init-scripts.

Such custom spells are stored in the local repsitory known as the
&quot;Grimoire&quot; on the system.

This extra effort required on the part of the SA insures that a Sorcerer
system isn't accidentally broken as a result of directly modifying
critical system files in /etc/init.d, since (modifications to) these files
are likely to be automatically overwritten during system updates.

In other words, modifications are to be affected by spells in the local
grimoire, and through editing of the init scripts directly by hand.

Enabling and disabling system daemons and services, however, can be
accomplished directly by merely chmod'ing the files to 600 to disable the
execution of the init script, or similary, to 700 to enable the execution
of the init script.

Unlike what most experienced administrators coming from other
distributions tend to expect in /etc/init.d, Sorcerer systems  typically
only install init-scripts for the software that has been installed, making
for a cleaner, less cluttered directory that is easy to glean the
installed software base from.

&lt;/snip&gt;

Kyle, please feel free to point out any inaccuracies.

Kindest regards,

Bradley
