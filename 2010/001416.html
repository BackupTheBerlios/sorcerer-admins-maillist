&gt;<i> Hi there, Nathan.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, so you got to the 3 step, and stuck there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the command line, issue:
</I>&gt;<i> man cfdisk
</I>&gt;<i> and read a little about what partitions are, and how to create them.
</I>
With some rare exceptions
manual pages are not normally available
for reading when booted from the I/R

&gt;<i> I do have a couple of questions for you, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you going to try and dual boot after this Sorcerer installation, or is
</I>&gt;<i> this the only OS on the computer?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are going to dual boot, I sure hope you have a backup of your windows
</I>&gt;<i> stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of dual booting, I would suggest backing up everything you find
</I>&gt;<i> important, then re-installing windows, but taking care to limit it's disk
</I>&gt;<i> usage by erasing it's partition off the disk, and then making a 10GB
</I>&gt;<i> partition and installing it into there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

&gt;<i> Then, I would read the lilo manual on how to do a successful dual boot.
</I>
Dual booting with lilo is basically chaining from
the lilo to the other boot manager/loader.

On a box with windoze ME installed on a secondary disk then
Adding this to /etc/lilo.conf.tail
will allow it lilo to chainload to the other bootloader.

other                   =       /dev/hda
        label           =       wme
        password        =       dish
        boot-as         =       0x80

windoze XP can not be chainloaded by running the bootblock
of the windoze XP partition.
That will bring up the windoze XP recovery menu.
Chaining to bootload a windoze partition on the same
disk that has lilo and/or a POSIX installed is difficult,
because the newer windoze versions insist upon
occupying the MBR, master boot record, of the fixed disk.
The MBR, is considered the very head of the disk.
When booting from fixed disk the code in the MBR is loaded
first and executed.
Typically, that code then loads the code in the boot block
of the first partition marked as bootable and runs that.
However, that might not be the situation with newer windoze.

Lilo can be installed in the boot block
of an ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystem.
Space is reserved at the front of those filesystems
for a bootloader to be installed.
So what might happen is that instead of running lilo first,
perhaps a foreign bootloader is loaded first that runs
and then chains to lilo in order to boot a POSIX.
I do not know anything about the windoze NT, XP bootloaders,
which differ from the simple bootable MBR installed in windoze
95 and 98.

Although I realize that SAs exist that would do so,
I would at all costs avoid installing windoze and Sorcerer
to the same fixed disk on separate partitions.
Almost always a box has at least one unused EIDE,
SCSI, or SATA connection.
Buying a separate fixed disk is worth the cost.

Trying to resize an existing partition
might cause data loss and/or corruption.
Before modifying a disk that contains data
that should not be lost; create a backup.
Anyone can accidentally overwrite a partition
that one intends to keep.
I did it not less than a decade ago.


&gt;<i> Again, this is not something I have done in a few years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If, on the other hand, Sorcerer is the only operating system that you are
</I>&gt;<i> going to install, things are a LOT simpler.
</I>
Also if Sorcerer occupies one fixed disk
and other operating systems exist on other fixed disks
then that also simplifies chain-loading.


&gt;<i> For a one-filesystem install of Sorcerer I would not try it in less than
</I>&gt;<i> 20GB, and 30GB is recommended.
</I>
I use 30G drives.  :)
Sure, they are small, but if the disks do not crash
then they are nearly golden.  :)
But sometimes an extra 10G seems useful.


&gt;<i> So, create a partition at the beginning of your disk of about 30GB
</I>&gt;<i> This partition will be called /dev/sda1 from now on...
</I>&gt;<i> Make the rest of your hard disk into /dev/sda2 ( just make another
</I>&gt;<i> filesystem that fills the rest of the disk. )
</I>
Parts of a disk can be left unallocated to partitions.
In that event an existing partition can grow in size
and so can the filesystem.
I vaguely recall reading about support for
growable filesystems with ext2,
but that was a long time ago.
Probably, by default Sorcerer does not create
filesystems that can grow.

Other additional useful partitions could be:
/home
/srv


&gt;<i> Now, in the Sorcerer install menu you can specify in the partition table
</I>&gt;<i> that:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;/dev/sda1 mounts on /
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/sda2 mounts on /home
</I>
If a dedicated /home partition is not created
then /home will reside on the / partition.
That is not necessarily bad.


&gt;<i> However, I have a little word of advice for you. We are not mind-readers,
</I>&gt;<i> and find it really difficult to help someone without a description of the
</I>&gt;<i> problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would find it very helpful of you could add a short description of the
</I>&gt;<i> steps you took to get to where you are stuck.
</I>
While that is true; many tech support questions are also
answered by merely conjecture.
By conjecture the odds of receiving a useful answer
seem to be around 50%  :)
Tech support by guessing has a surprisingly
much better rate of success than I would expect.
But even so detailed reports tend to receive
the most useful and helpful replies.
Also without detailed descriptions replies
to questions might be sprawling and contain
much digression that could supply answers
to future anticipated problems.
I am probably the #1 culprit of writing
painfully long email replies.  :)
