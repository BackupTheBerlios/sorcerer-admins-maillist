<PRE>Good that you asked on the list.
Some only work with older kernels.
The NetGear WG111v2 is supported,
although the range is somewhat limited
and it tends to disconnect frequently.
It uses the rtl8187 module

Assuming one has /usr/src/linux/
One could enter that directory and run
make menuconfig
then goto
Device Drivers ---&gt;
Network device support ---&gt;
Wireless LAN ---&gt;

And the drivers there are a mixed selection.
Some are for PCI/ISA and others for USB.
The important thing to know is chipset.
But chipset is often not written on a commercial box.
The Atmel at76c50* for USB might currently be broke.
I do not recommend it.

The incomplete list at:
<A HREF="http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Devices/USB">http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Devices/USB</A>
might somehow be useful?

Sometimes drivers might work only IPv4 and not IPv6
or might not support the type of encryption desired.
Nothing like plugging it in to check.
Before plugging on in run
lsmod &gt; /tmp/before.txt
That way /tmp/before.txt has a listing of modules loaded
before the USB wireless network adapter was plugged in.
After it is pluged in
lsmod &gt; /tmp/after.txt
That way the list can be compared to see what loaded or did not load.

diff /tmp/before.txt /tmp/after.txt

Also check dmesg
just run it.
See what information was printed into the kernel ring buffer
about the detected hardware and modules loaded.
udev will handle the hotplug event.
If successful something new should print
when using the command
ip addr show
It might be something like wlan0
If so then try configuring it and connecting to the wireless network.

Hardware detection, module loading, and firmware loading
is as plug-n-pray on linux as it would be on any operating system.
However, network configuration is still up to the SA.

A real possibility is that the driver you want to use
is present for the linux kernel, but the firmware is not installed.
There are spells for some firmware in the grimoire.
If you write a new spell for firmware please send me the
spell if you want it to be in the grimoire for other SAs
to also be able to use.

# augur attribute firmware
alsa-firmware
at76_usb-firmware
atmel-firmware
bluez-firmware
iwlwifi-1000-ucode
iwlwifi-3945-ucode
iwlwifi-4965-ucode
iwlwifi-5000-ucode
iwlwifi-5150-ucode
iwlwifi-6000-ucode
prism54-firmware
ralink-firmware

That lists some spells for firmware.
alsa-firmware is probably only for sound cards.
bluez-firmware is probably only for bluetooth.
The rest are for network cards.
firmware is usually easy to find in the grimoire,
because the spell will likely have the same
name as the filename for download at
the manufacturer's website.

The firmware is not likely to be available as a spell
unless another Sorcerer SA is already
using that type of network device.
Sorry for the inconvenience of the find your own firmware game.

If it was a device intended for a windoze operating system
it might sort of work out of box, but in the past I would
always visit manufacturer's websites to download the
latest drivers, firmware, and software for any device
including motherboards.
For linux only the firmware will be required if
firmware is required at all,
and most devices do not require firmware.

Hope that helps explain it.
Doing a google search might provide a list
that would be useful.
I started with linux USB wireless

ndiswrapper, if it compiles, is a lesser known trick
for being able to use windows drivers with a linux kernel.
See the description of the spell and homepage for more information.
It probably comes pre-installed on a Sorcerer I/R
I have never tried it.
