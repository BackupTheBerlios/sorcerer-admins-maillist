It went away.  :)
I did not like waiting for it.
Probably it was rarely used for dislike of waiting.
Probably runs nearly instantly on a box with RAM drives.
However, on fixed-disk
it accessed lots of files/dirs all over the disk
and required considerable time to complete.

I did not dislike the augur alien command.
It is a useful command.
So I made a spell out of it &quot;sorcery-alien&quot;
# cast sorcery-alien
it will re-cast itself weekly.
It's compile log contains the list of aliens.
That way whenever a SA wants to hunt aliens
they can just start with the compile log
of sorcery-alien.

Is it more useful as an augur command?

A while ago a number of augur commands that
tended to be periodic became spells.
Or maybe some were spells from before then?

Well at the moment I am thinking about:
sorcery-alien
sorcery-backup
sorcery-bxz
sorcery-clean
sorcery-defrag
sorcery-immune
sorcery-md5sum

Ah, I do not recommend using sorcery-backup.
I have not reviewed that spell in a long time.
Probably not since 2008.
It is still written to compress files using 7za instead of xz.

Another useful spells is the &quot;etc&quot; spell.
It is a strange modular spell that I last updated
probably in 2008.
# augur forget etc; cast etc
That will cast it.
Basically, it is a menu that helps SAs
learn about and edit some files in /etc
It is really a one-time cast type spell.
And I can not remember why I wanted
to make that spell instead of adding
it as menus to sorcery.

If you had not noticed already
augur is now a very modular type program.
Each augur command is in it's own file.
The augur command module files are loaded as needed.
/usr/libexec/sorcery/augur.d/ is full of modules.
The SA also can also install their own augur modules.
SA augur modules should be placed in
/usr/local/libexec/sorcery/augur.d/
They will be discovered and made available automatically.

The modularization of augur makes
augur easier to maintain.
And a change that might break
a single augur module will not break the rest.
And I can accept SA contributed augur modules
provided that they are augur modules.
The SA only has to figure out what code
they want to put into the augur module
which will mostly be copy 'n paste from
a similar augur module, not unlike creating spells.

At the moment 71 augur modules exist.
Having more is fine provided they are useful.
Maybe some are not so useful:

&quot;
# augur help older

Sometimes a SA may wonder exactly how many days, or years,
a spell has been installed without being updated.
The older function provides an easy way show these spells.
This is a useful command since Sorcerer boxes are typically
installed once and updated for years.
&quot;

I never use the # augur older
command.
But it could be used to recompile
spells that have been installed for a long time.
For example:
# cast $( augur older 365 )

Additionally, most help modules have
extra verbose help screens that can be viewed
by typing
# augur help $COMMAND

The &quot;older&quot; command has a fitting name.
However, judging from the name alone
the function is not entirely obvious.

I probably forgot to mention a lot of useful stuff.
Naturally, some aspects internal to sorcery
and spells have changed.
However, the outward appearance and
use of sorcery is mostly unchanged.
Although indexing is a little slower now,
every other aspect is faster.
Faster is nice, but on multi-core boxes
the word &quot;instant&quot; is a better description.
*lol*
I can even receive instant answers for
# augur aron $SPELL
and
# augur iron $SPELL
commands.
Only have to wait a few seconds for indexing to complete;
just like starting the engine and warming it up a little
before going full throttle.

Speaking of faster;
the new version of ccache can concatenate files
itself without using the C pre-processor in order
to produce hashes several times faster.
With reduced overhead the new ccache is
about 3 to 5 times faster.
It is faster on the initial compile of software
and faster on the subsequent update compiles.
Still there is a little overhead for using it.

I will stop rambling.
Hope you enjoy the changes.
