# cast --deps $( augur installed )

Any software that would have it as an optional requirement
would again present a menu to select that optional requirement
as on or off when that software is cast.
So the above command to configure all installed software
would not normally be required.


&gt;<i> Configuring just one spell without blowing away the config of every

</I>&gt;<i> the old days.
</I>
Actually, it is not that.
It simply forgets where the spell was selected as
optionally on/off in other spells that have an optional
on the spell that is begin forgotten.


&gt;<i> I do a lot of reconfigging spells, especially things like ffmpeg, and
</I>&gt;<i> really don't want to reconfigure every spell that I have installed

Then probably the SA could issue
# rm -f /etc/sorcery/log/opt.{on,off}/ffmpeg
# cast --deps ffmepg


&gt;<i> &quot;augur forget&quot; is useful, and I don't want it to go away, I just would

</I>

I understand.
My position on it has not changed.
The nomenclature is confusing.
# augur forget
does everything that a SA would want
and then maybe even a little more.
But it does not fall short.

If there should be separate augur commands
that deal with forgetting information about a spell
then the choice of names for those commands
should be very clear and carefully considered.

# augur | grep forget
forget     spells          *      Reconfigure spells

Confusing to add another augur command and call it reconfigure
when the description for the forget command says reconfigure.

What would be useful is good names and good descriptions
for what the commands should do.

I am not at all attached with using the name &quot;forget&quot;
for an augur command.
Using something else would be a slight inconvenience to SAs
that have scripts that invoke augur forget.
But if the scope and duties of the &quot;forget&quot; command is
changed or redefined then perhaps also it deserves a better name?

The reason I created that all-in-one fire-and-forget
# augur forget
command was because I was already feeling slightly
confused about separate commands with different names.
I did not want for SAs to become confused and
either not see, not expect, or not select the proper
command to accomplish what was desired.

If for example a spell is only installed as an optional requirement
then a SA could type something like:

# augur forget $SPELL
# dispel $SPELL

and it should be removed.
Also a SA should be able to do something like:

# augur forget $SPELL
# augur progress $SPELL exile
# dispel $SPELL

And that would probably pry off any installed spell
and keep it from returning.


As for
# cast -r
The scope of that became unintentionally larger than desired.
It might not do what a SA expects
or might do far more than the SA wants
depending upon what is in the cast queue
or what will be added in order to fulfill requirements.

cast is very recursive and adds spells to the queue
and therefore parameters like:

-c | --compile  Ignore /var/cache/archive and compile all spells
-d | --deps     Configure and select requirements, but do not cast
-f | --force    Attempt compilation even if cast expects spell to fail
-u | --reuse    Use previous installation from archive when possible

might do something unexpected
or might fail to do something that is expected.

I do not know if the force command will carry.
It should be lost if the invocation used to compile cast
was not the invocation with -f as given by the SA.

-c might normally work okay provided that
there is not another cast already running.
The -c effects what is put into the cast queue
and therefore is not a parameter that must
be provided to subsequent invocations of cast.

The -d command should be safe to use
provided that no other invocation of cast is already running.

To be frank,
the less non spell parameters that cast accepts
then the more predictably it should perform.


So before making changes to augur
we must have a very clear idea for the commands,
the names of those commands, and their descriptions
otherwise we might be changing it again and again
or leaving it in a state that confuses new Sorcerer SAs.


Remember, I am not trying to be difficult about this.
I selected a path that was expected to be the lesser of two evils.

Currently, there are 72 augur commands.
Very few SAs will be looking at the augur help screen
in a terminal window with enough rows required in order
to view the entire list of augur commands without scrolling.

Since the augur help screen is now displayed
alphabetically rather than categorically,
as it was in the old days,
finding commands with a similar function
that have dissimilar names is now problematic.
