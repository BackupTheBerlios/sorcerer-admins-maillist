<PRE>Hi Nathan,

CDs are strange mediums. Optical media is a great improvement over that of
magnetic media storage systems in the sense of convenience, and in some
(but not all) ways, longevity and archiving.

When this extended to music and television it was good too, and it was
bad. CDs were originally touted as a 'forever' medium. That has proven to
be a falacy.

Manufacturing methods have dropped in standards, and I for one wonder
sometimes when a movie jams in the player why we left VHS tapes behind -
they seem to work even when weathered and although the quality drops, they
still work - while CDs and DVDs just lockup and convert themselves into
frisbees.

Plus, with regards to movies, fast forward and rewind work a lot better on
tape than they ever have on optical media.

But I digress. What I'm getting at, is that I think your CD may be a
little bunk. This can happen if you choose 'auto' for the burn rate on
your machine, if we use cheap burners, CDs/DVDs or have a slight glitch in
the downloaded .iso file (the latter not being the fault of the optical
media or the burner).

Bad images can also be the result of a burning process while running a
bunch of other apps on the workstation at the same time.

Assuming that you have the latest 32bit version of the .iso image
(20100207), the first thing that I would suggest that you run the
following on the iso image that you downloaded:

$ md5sum sorcerer-ia32-20100207.iso

if the resulting md5sum string generated equals
'160d0639c66b48920997c04b7bfbd15f', then the .iso image file you
downloaded is fine, and I would suspect the actual burn you performed. If
it doesn't match that number, then you have a corrupt file and you need to
download the .iso file again.

If the burn is suspect (the md5sums match), then my recommendation is to
burn the CD again at a 'much' lower burn rate - say, 4x or 8x, instead of
16x or higher.

Errors of this type are quite common at high burn rates and burning at a
lower speed when you have no other applications running on your
workstation will usually take care of that problem.

If the version of Sorcerer you downloaded is different than the one I
mentioned above, then download the md5 sums for that particular image and
run md5sum on your image, comparing the result - they should match or you
have a corrupt file.

I hope that helps and please lemme know how it goes okay?

Kindest regards,

Bradley
