</I>
An empty file created in /var/lock/ as an indication that
something happened successfully is called a lock file.
And a lock file is created for /etc/init.d/networks


&gt;<i> The mounting init-script ( for instance) does not have a PID at all, because
</I>&gt;<i> after the script has run, it exits. However, if it's exit status was known,
</I>&gt;<i> another script can see if it's worth it to even run.
</I>
If the mount script fails totally or partially
then following init-scripts can do nothing about it.
And naturally /etc/init.d/mount will run.
There is no uncertainty about it.


&gt;<i> We should define which scripts are absolutely critical to a running Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> system, and those should give you a command line if they fail to run, and
</I>&gt;<i> not run the following scripts as you may muck up a perfectly good working
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>
What would you do with a command line
if /proc fails to mount or / fails to mount?
If / fails to mount
perhaps that is due to a udev update
and the new udev is not working as expected.
Nothing one does to /etc/init.d/mount
nor any amount of retries will fix that.
However, booting with kernel parameter coldplug
might enable the box to boot normally.
Aside from that does anyone on the list
know what to do if udev fails to work?

Having a robust system that can automatically
anticipate, fix and circumvent problems
is a better solution than granting a BASH prompt
and with a line of text telling the SA to figure out
the problem on his own.
If the SA is going to debug sysinit
then the debugging should start rdinit=/bin/bash
so the SA can observe the pre and post states
of the box after running each init-script.
That way the SA can discover, for example,
if udev is working properly.


&gt;<i> If for instance, an SA adjusted the running kernel so that the root
</I>&gt;<i> filesystem type is no longer recognizable, there is no point in loading
</I>&gt;<i> anything else... the system is unbootable, and the SA should be informed,
</I>&gt;<i> and the system not try to boot until the problem has been rectified. A
</I>&gt;<i> command line at this point would be helpful at this point too.
</I>
I forget about what prints when that happens.
But the box will boot and enter runlevel with
the initramfs mounted as /
Then the SA can log in, try to manually mount
the / on /media/root and discover that the filesystem
type of / lacks an appropriate driver/module.

This problem does not have to be anticipated.
The chance of that happening is almost 0.0%.
Sorcerer SAs should be using linux
and not linux-custom unless they make near
perfect config files for linux every time.


&gt;<i> I am sure there are a few more examples of critical scripts that, if
</I>&gt;<i> activated, must absolutely be run.
</I>
The init-scripts that run during sysinit that are critical
tends to depend upon what the SA decides is critical.
For example only on boxes that use LUKS encrypted devices is
/etc/init.d/cryptmount
a critical init-script.

/etc/init.d/mount is critical on most boxes,
but too late to do anything about the situation
if mounting of / fails.
If mounting of other filesystems fail
then usually the box can boot
and have those problems fixed permanently
when the SA logs in.
