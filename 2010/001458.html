Wow, that seems serious.
The last time I saw something like that was when
an incompelte initramfs we created that lacked
kernel modules.
It happened because of disk space shortage.
I solved it by booting an older linux from the list.
If those device nodes are not created
then the first thing I would check is to see
if /lib/modules/ has appropraite kernel modules
for the kernel being run according to /proc/version
If the kernel modules are missing
then both mknod and udev are useless.


&gt;<i> Boots ok, but those device files goes missing. What should i do, udev

</I>&gt;<i> Did create those manually:

</I>&gt;<i> mknod sda2 b 8 2
</I>&gt;<i> mknod sda5 b 8 5
</I>&gt;<i> mknod sdb b 8 16
</I>&gt;<i> mknod sdb1 b 8 17
</I>&gt;<i> mknod sdb2 b 8 18
</I>&gt;<i> mknod sdb5 b 8 21
</I>&gt;<i> mknod md0 b 9 0
</I>
Did that help?
Did you do a normal kernel version boot
or did it fail to create those while doing a fast boot?
If it failed during a fast boot
then it might not have been udev's fault,
but rather a mistake that I coded.

My guess is that the udev version that is current
in the grimoire is good for use.
I tested it and also did a reboot test.
But I tested it on a box with IDE hardware and not SCSI.

Will you double check please and verify that the problem
is caused by udev?

On my test box I also keep a copy of udev installed,
but extracted from archive in a subdirectory in /etc/
That way if the installed udev is seriously broke
then I can copy that older udev out of the directory
and use it instead.

However, if udev is not working then....
/etc/coldplug/dev contains a /dev
that can be copied to /dev
And also /etc/coldplug/modules
contains a properly ordered list of modules to load.

I crated a kernel parameter that
can force it to be used or disregarded,
now which is it and what was it?

Oh yeah...
Add coldplug to the kernel command line.
That will use my previously saved coldplug events
instead of leaving the task to udev.
That should bail the box out.

I am reasonably certain that sometime during sysinit
that it prints something like...

udev with udevadm trigger will handle coldplug events
If this fails or requires longer than 200 seconds
then please try rebooting with the kernel parameter:
coldplug
to reuse previously used coldplug events

But who reads scroll, yes?

I created this alternate method for handling cold plug events,
because I do not have 100% confidence in udev.
At least this aught to bail a box out if it previously
could boot but now due to some udev bug
bites the bullet during sysinit.
I hope that helps.
