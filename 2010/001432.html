<PRE>The oblig. car analogy....

Having Sorcerer as your first distro is like learning to drive in a F1 race
car without having driven anything else before. It certainly IS possible,
but not easy.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yes this is my first time dealing with linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer is an unusual first choice,
</I>&gt;<i> although you are not the first to start with it.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer was designed to scratch the itch
</I>&gt;<i> that senior level SAs acquire
</I>&gt;<i> from using pre-compiled binary based distros.
</I>&gt;<i> Or another way of saying it would be that
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer provides SAs far more power and control
</I>&gt;<i> than any pre-compiled binary based distro.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer boxes are also a bit more advanced than
</I>&gt;<i> package based distros.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer boxes automatically detect when an upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> of an installed library will also require additional installed
</I>&gt;<i> software to be recompiled, relinked and re-installed,
</I>&gt;<i> and Sorcerer boxes do this automatically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For SAs that have requirements for a significant amount
</I>&gt;<i> of software to be configured, compiled, and linked
</I>&gt;<i> in a very specific way
</I>&gt;<i> then by using Sorcerer spells they can achieve the precise
</I>&gt;<i> loadout and configuration of software for their boxes.
</I>&gt;<i> In the past only by building a box using the instructions in
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;Linux From Scratch&quot; online book could a SA achieve
</I>&gt;<i> the amount of control that Sorcerer grants.
</I>&gt;<i> However, installing a box by reading and following
</I>&gt;<i> what is in the the &quot;Linux From Scratch&quot; book often requires
</I>&gt;<i> months of constant concentration and effort and by the time
</I>&gt;<i> all the desired software is installed, 1/4th of it is already obsolete
</I>&gt;<i> by newer bug-fixed available versions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In contrast Sorcerer boxes can receive updates timely
</I>&gt;<i> from a grimoire, a catalog of software, tarball that is rolled daily.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer boxes can stay on top of the constantly changing
</I>&gt;<i> software situation.
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, Sorcerer boxes can migrate
</I>&gt;<i> from past to present to future
</I>&gt;<i> for as long as a SA is willing to update a box.
</I>&gt;<i> Package based distros usually require a complete re-installation
</I>&gt;<i> from new Install/Rescue CDs nearly every other year.
</I>&gt;<i> That is a very annoyingly large headache for SAs.
</I>&gt;<i> And it can cost downtime on production machines
</I>&gt;<i> unless a package based distro is installed on a new box
</I>&gt;<i> data from the existing production machine transported over,
</I>&gt;<i> and then have the old production machine replaced with the
</I>&gt;<i> new production machine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In recent years computer technology and speeds have not
</I>&gt;<i> improved like they did in the earlier years of
</I>&gt;<i> 80386, 80486, and 80586.
</I>&gt;<i> Also the amount of CPU power in a modern computer is often
</I>&gt;<i> overkill for the average role of any box.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, that has created an interest in virtualization
</I>&gt;<i> for more lucrative leasing where providers can
</I>&gt;<i> lease spare CPU cycles instead of entire
</I>&gt;<i> real systems and entire CPUs.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I digress.
</I>&gt;<i> My point is that for the role most boxes perform the demands
</I>&gt;<i> of the role do not usually sufficiently increase in 2 years in order
</I>&gt;<i> to make the hardware seem obsolete for the role.
</I>&gt;<i> Boxes can be expected to be deployed 5 years and longer
</I>&gt;<i> where often the first component that requires replacing
</I>&gt;<i> would be the power supply.
</I>&gt;<i> Also more modular computer designs like blade servers
</I>&gt;<i> and computers with unlockable CPU cores
</I>&gt;<i> can have their power augmented in order to maintain
</I>&gt;<i> adequate power for the role they perform.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, having an operating system for those computers
</I>&gt;<i> go out of date and become obsolete is a pain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some companies are so lazy or disinterested that they will
</I>&gt;<i> leave an obsolete package based distro installed on a box
</I>&gt;<i> rather than take it down and install a newer package based distro.
</I>&gt;<i> This is annoying to users, and also a potential security risk.
</I>&gt;<i> Some package based distros discontinue all support of a
</I>&gt;<i> one of their releases that is more than 1 release older than current.
</I>&gt;<i> Another way of putting it is that old distro release becomes
</I>&gt;<i> a never changing, never moving target that is ripe for attack
</I>&gt;<i> if anyone can spot a vulnerability in it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With Sorcerer, Install/Rescue images
</I>&gt;<i> that are more than one version older than current
</I>&gt;<i> are considered obsolete for the use of Installing
</I>&gt;<i> and Rescuing Sorcerer boxes.
</I>&gt;<i> However, boxes that were previously installed by those CDs
</I>&gt;<i> are never considered obsolete if they are updated constantly.
</I>&gt;<i> With Sorcerer all history merges with the present and evolves
</I>&gt;<i> into the single future of Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> There are no separate release branches
</I>&gt;<i> pre-determined to  come to a dead end in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer does not abandon the SA.
</I>&gt;<i> Typically, the only way a Sorcerer SA encounters significant trouble
</I>&gt;<i> is when the Sorcerer SA abandons updating their box and
</I>&gt;<i> then hopes to leap it back to current without having updated
</I>&gt;<i> the box for over a year.
</I>&gt;<i> Suddenly, they discover that the grimoire and sorcery
</I>&gt;<i> were compressed with xz and their box does not have xz installed.
</I>&gt;<i> So they must manually download xz, manually compile it,
</I>&gt;<i> extract the contents of sorcery and grimoire tarballs and
</I>&gt;<i> install those manually, etc...
</I>&gt;<i> In that type of hypothetical situation the Sorcerer SA caused
</I>&gt;<i> the problem for self by not updating a Sorcerer box timely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The cost of the uninterrupted evolution of Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> is that the tools will change over time
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore boxes must keep up with these changes.
</I>&gt;<i> There is no problem like that with package based distros.
</I>&gt;<i> However, releases of package based distros
</I>&gt;<i> have a lifetime of about 2 years.
</I>&gt;<i> So take your pick.
</I>&gt;<i> Update no less than quarterly?
</I>&gt;<i> Or do a huge smacking headache of a re-install every 2 years?
</I>&gt;<i> I know what my choice is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason for that long explanation is so that the following
</I>&gt;<i> statements does not make Sorcerer appear lame.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer is designed by senior level SAs for senior level SAs.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, eventually, we want to drop the skill level check down
</I>&gt;<i> to a point where merely experienced SAs will want to migrate
</I>&gt;<i> to Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> However, there is a huge world of difference between Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> and a distribution that is designed for entirely new SAs,
</I>&gt;<i> or those distros specializing in noobs.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> Being a noob is not a bad thing.
</I>&gt;<i> We we all were noobs at the start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, without wanting to make Sorcerer sound lame,
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer is not what would typically be recommended to
</I>&gt;<i> a someone who is new to POSIX administration.
</I>&gt;<i> That is not to imply that success is impossible,
</I>&gt;<i> but rather that there might be opportunity for many
</I>&gt;<i> fun challenges to overcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From observing your feedback I am trying to add ideas
</I>&gt;<i> to my todo list about how I aught to change the menu driven installer
</I>&gt;<i> in order to create a greater probability of a successful installation.
</I>&gt;<i> So your feedback will be of great help to future Sorcerer SAs.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer might never become a noob friendly distro,
</I>&gt;<i> because the price for wielding so much power
</I>&gt;<i> is of course the knowledge and skill required to do so.
</I>&gt;<i> However, Sorcerer still has a long evolution ahead towards
</I>&gt;<i> achieving better between the power / knowledge requirement ration.
</I>&gt;<i> If that ratio is now 1/1 then in the future 100/1 would be even better.
</I>&gt;<i> A means to that end, to shifting it in that direction
</I>&gt;<i> is to improve the usability of the menu driven installer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, the menu driven installer is a bit like a skill check.
</I>&gt;<i> In the past it definitely was a skill check.
</I>&gt;<i> It required the SA to complete a successful make menuconfig
</I>&gt;<i> on a linux kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> To be blunt most experienced SAs
</I>&gt;<i> were unable to pass the skill check.
</I>&gt;<i> They would manage to install it,
</I>&gt;<i> but be unable to boot it
</I>&gt;<i> because they did something like:
</I>&gt;<i> forgetting to compile drivers for their fixed disk;
</I>&gt;<i> making those fixed disk drivers modular instead of compiled in;
</I>&gt;<i> forgetting to compile the filesystems they used for installing;
</I>&gt;<i> forgetting to make those filesystems compiled in;
</I>&gt;<i> or for other reasons;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Today's menu driven installer is much much much easier.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer comes with a pre-compiled modular kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> And upon updates of boxes the modular kernel is
</I>&gt;<i> configured automatically and compiled.
</I>&gt;<i> So the SA is no longer troubled to have the skills that
</I>&gt;<i> are required in order to have a custom linux kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> This was a HUGE skill check.
</I>&gt;<i> And now it is gone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fact that the menu driven installer has no apparent bugs
</I>&gt;<i> and works, yet it is not a successful experience for everyone
</I>&gt;<i> is an indication that it is still a skill check.
</I>&gt;<i> It is the gate that bars the entry of some SAs.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet, it is not the intention of Sorcerer designers to prohibit
</I>&gt;<i> anyone from using the distro.
</I>&gt;<i> So having such a high, thick iron gate at the front
</I>&gt;<i> is not intentional, but it is a a consequence of how
</I>&gt;<i> the menu driven installer is designed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The menu driven installer is designed to grant SAs
</I>&gt;<i> nearly all the freedom that a SA would have doing a manual install,
</I>&gt;<i> yet with the convenience of not having to type those commands.
</I>&gt;<i> To an experienced SAs the menu driven installer is like
</I>&gt;<i> several trails of bread crumbs.
</I>&gt;<i> The SA must only decide which bread the SA likes best
</I>&gt;<i> and then follow that trail.
</I>&gt;<i> But those trails are invisible to noob SAs
</I>&gt;<i> that are unfamiliar with what is required in order to install a distro.
</I>&gt;<i> This is something that was not given consideration
</I>&gt;<i> when the menu driven installer was created.
</I>&gt;<i> The main consideration for the menu driven installer
</I>&gt;<i> is whether it will allow senior level SAs to do what senior
</I>&gt;<i> level SAs would want to do during an installation.
</I>&gt;<i> And yes, it can do LUKS encryption, LVM2, software raids, etc...
</I>&gt;<i> So it seems like a success.
</I>&gt;<i> But it is also a successful portcullis, unfortunately.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If someone continues trying
</I>&gt;<i> then they will definitely achieve success with the installer.
</I>&gt;<i> But I can not know if the experience of Sorcerer for a noob
</I>&gt;<i> is any better than would be their experience using a distro
</I>&gt;<i> that is designed for noobs.
</I>&gt;<i> One should not make the premature conclusion that all
</I>&gt;<i> distros are as difficult to install as Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> Distros that are designed for noobs should be easier to install.
</I>&gt;<i> There are even &quot;Live CD&quot; distros that can be booted from CD
</I>&gt;<i> and used without having to install to a fixed disk.
</I>&gt;<i> Each type of distro has different strengths and weaknesses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer is very far away from the center or norm for distros.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer caters very heavily to senior level SAs' requirements,
</I>&gt;<i> needs and feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer has all the classic strengths and weaknesses
</I>&gt;<i> of a true pure source based distro.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer is not like a hybrid distro that tries to be a blend
</I>&gt;<i> of a package and source based distro.
</I>&gt;<i> For people who are happy with the advantages of Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> and not bothered by the disadvantages
</I>&gt;<i> then Sorcerer is an excellent and yes even fun tool!
</I>&gt;<i> But for a noob I would imagine that Sorcerer is probably
</I>&gt;<i> closer to a reoccurring nightmare,
</I>&gt;<i> or at least one bucket of cold sweat.
</I>&gt;<i> That is not to imply that Sorcerer is lame.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer is merely awesome for what Sorcerer was designed to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope you decide to continue trying and
</I>&gt;<i> achieve success with installing and deploying Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> I am told that by SAs that using Sorcerer for 2 months
</I>&gt;<i> is a more educational experience than using a package
</I>&gt;<i> based distro for 2 years.
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, the person who last told me it gave a name of
</I>&gt;<i> the distro he used before and said 2 weeks instead of 2 months,
</I>&gt;<i> but I do not want to to brag about Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> nor put down any specific distro.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each distro is basically like a tool.
</I>&gt;<i> Some are like flat head screw driver.
</I>&gt;<i> Others are like a hammer.
</I>&gt;<i> Selecting the right tool for a task tends
</I>&gt;<i> to achieve easy and desirable success.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, using a hammer to drive screws into a wall is a possibility.
</I>&gt;<i> But one would not expect ideal results from the effort.
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise driving a nail into a wall using a screw driver is possible.
</I>&gt;<i> However, clearly that is a task best suited for a hammer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The 3 factors that merge and form success are:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. SA skill
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Distro design
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Role of the box.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly when the SA has great skill
</I>&gt;<i> then skill is the most important factor.
</I>&gt;<i> It also tends to be the limiting factor as
</I>&gt;<i> to what distros the SA can select and deploy.
</I>&gt;<i> Also there are some distros that are designed
</I>&gt;<i> to do only one task such as to be deployed as a firewall.
</I>&gt;<i> Using a role specific distro for a role specific task
</I>&gt;<i> tends to produce good results for that task
</I>&gt;<i> while usually requiring minimal effort and skill.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly SA skill is the most important factor,
</I>&gt;<i> especially when a senior level SA is retrospecting.
</I>&gt;<i> The limits of what can be accomplished using
</I>&gt;<i> the sorcery tools is proportional to the SA's skill,
</I>&gt;<i> especially the SA's skill with shell commands and shell scripting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The design of the sorcery tools are a modular set of building blocks.
</I>&gt;<i> And a SA is like a young person fitting the building blocks together
</I>&gt;<i> in order to create something amusing and interesting.
</I>&gt;<i> The building blocks themselves look unassuming
</I>&gt;<i> and uninteresting when in a pile and when not fitted together.
</I>&gt;<i> The skill of the person putting the pieces together
</I>&gt;<i> determines the grandeur of the final composition.
</I>&gt;<i> And Sorcerer is very much like that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example...
</I>&gt;<i> Let us say that a SA is curious to know what
</I>&gt;<i> 10 installed software projects are consuming the most disk space.
</I>&gt;<i> There is no single command to accomplish this.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it can be assessed very quickly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # augur installed | augur size | sort -gr | head -n 10
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> augur installed: that outputs a list of installed spells
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> augur size: reads from stdin a list of spells
</I>&gt;<i>     and outputs the kilobytes totals for installed files by that spell
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> sort -gr: sorts input numerical and
</I>&gt;<i>     then reverses the sort to output highest values first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> head -n 10: prints the first 10 lines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Putting commands together like that is simple for a senior level SA.
</I>&gt;<i> It is no different than stacking together some building blocks.
</I>&gt;<i> And now it looks like something cool and useful.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is an example that demonstrates that
</I>&gt;<i> the ease at which sorcery can be wielded
</I>&gt;<i> to achieve results and provide information
</I>&gt;<i> is proportional to SA skill.
</I>&gt;<i> To a new SA sorcery is probably somewhat confusing
</I>&gt;<i> and perhaps not very interesting.
</I>&gt;<i> But then again so were building blocks
</I>&gt;<i> when I first saw them.
</I>&gt;<i> At best I could make only a rectangular house.
</I>&gt;<i> Not until many years later did someone show me
</I>&gt;<i> how something that looked like a spaceship could
</I>&gt;<i> be created from the building blocks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the long explanation.
</I>&gt;<i> But I hope it shows how sorcery and Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> can be and can become a positive experience for a SA
</I>&gt;<i> that has the tenacity required to become a senior level SA.
</I>&gt;<i> Starting with something easier is possible.
</I>&gt;<i> However, eventually, it will probably lead a SA
</I>&gt;<i> back to something like Sorcerer eventually.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My apology if that insinuates Sorcerer SAs are
</I>&gt;<i> elite, snobbish, power mongers.
</I>&gt;<i> To the contrary they are nice, helpful, and capable.
</I>&gt;<i> Half of the time they tend to supply answers to
</I>&gt;<i> to their own technical support questions.
</I>&gt;<i> Even I enjoy receiving bug reports along with solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> That is great for me since it saves me time and effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Being a Sorcerer SA is both a great experience and
</I>&gt;<i> also a bit like a badge of honor because to join us
</I>&gt;<i> requires a rare combination of tenacity and/or skill.
</I>&gt;<i> And yes, what one lacks in skill can be compensated
</I>&gt;<i> with raw tenacity.
</I>&gt;<i> Merely, trying all the paths that do not work eventually
</I>&gt;<i> will lead a person to the path of success.
</I>&gt;<i> I forget what the name for that is called.
</I>&gt;<i> Success through perseverance perhaps?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Making mistakes is not bad.
</I>&gt;<i> Even by making a mistake one learns that
</I>&gt;<i> is not an optimal method for achieving the desired result.
</I>&gt;<i> So please grant yourself patience
</I>&gt;<i> and enjoy the process of learning it
</I>&gt;<i> even when making mistakes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To create the very first bootable Sorcerer I/R
</I>&gt;<i> I did not copy nor look at what any other distro was doing.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead I did some web searching to discover what software
</I>&gt;<i> could be used as a bootloader on CDROM.
</I>&gt;<i> I selected a few to try.
</I>&gt;<i> Even upon deciding which one I wanted to use
</I>&gt;<i> I did not achieve immediate success.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead I spent nearly 5 days teaching myself how
</I>&gt;<i> to successfully create a bootable CDROM image.
</I>&gt;<i> Not everything comes immediately and easy.
</I>&gt;<i> Even the current sorcery tools
</I>&gt;<i> are a product of a decade's worth
</I>&gt;<i> of use and feedback from SAs.
</I>&gt;<i> It did not become awesome overnight.
</I>&gt;<i> And the first rough drafts of the tools were
</I>&gt;<i> little more than a technology demonstration
</I>&gt;<i> that provided that source based management was possible.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, most of the original design
</I>&gt;<i> and original implementation had to be discarded
</I>&gt;<i> due to short-sightedness and critical design flaws.
</I>&gt;<i> That does seem to imply that it was a failure,
</I>&gt;<i> but I prefer to think of it as a stepping stone on
</I>&gt;<i> the path towards success.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes success is closer than it might seem.
</I>&gt;<i> But it can only be achieved by those with sufficient tenacity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason for that digression is to demonstrate
</I>&gt;<i> that the high skill required in order to wield sorcery
</I>&gt;<i> and install Sorcerer can be achieved through tenacity.
</I>&gt;<i> Like many things in life,
</I>&gt;<i> one can not fail at trying to becoming a Sorcerer SA
</I>&gt;<i> unless one decides to quit trying.
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I feel that way about the Japanese language.
</I>&gt;<i> Learning Japanese for an English speaker is very difficult.
</I>&gt;<i> But as long as I do not quit trying
</I>&gt;<i> then I have not yet failed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tenacity is not merely that which separates senior level SAs
</I>&gt;<i> from regular SAs, but also what separates most normal people
</I>&gt;<i> from occupations like software engineer that require tenacity.
</I>&gt;<i> I have met people that totally lack tenacity.
</I>&gt;<i> They give into the slightest frustration
</I>&gt;<i> and throw temper-tantrums.
</I>&gt;<i> I feel sorry for those people because they move
</I>&gt;<i> even simple tasks into the realm of impossibility.
</I>&gt;<i> But that is a digression I do not want to continue to follow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rather instead because you decided upon Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> you are likely a person who has the required tenacity.
</I>&gt;<i> In spite of what anyone might say to encourage you
</I>&gt;<i> or discourage you, please remain confident in yourself.
</I>&gt;<i> Remember the fable of &quot;the tortoise and the hare.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Even if slow moving,
</I>&gt;<i> that which continues to push forward will eventually succeed,
</I>&gt;<i> while those who have natural talent but lack tenacity
</I>&gt;<i> will probably snooze and lose.
