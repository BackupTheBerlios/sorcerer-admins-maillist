<PRE>Having X11 handle input events through hal which gets them from
/dev/event* device nodes
that are updated by [events/0] kernel process is like the water-slide
of improvements.
Sure it is fun and round about,
but much time and CPU attention is required
in order to wind around the curves.
This makes for unresponsive event handling under load,
especially on single core boxes.

Lost or delayed keyboard and mouse events such as the pressing
and releasing of keys or buttons or movement can be very annoying.
It is nearly enough to want to drive a SA to return to using the
old xf86-input-keyboard and xf86-input-mouse,
which both will probably disappear in the near future.
Fortunately, there is an adequate solution.

First, hald will be started at nice -19 so that it is extremely rude about
grabbing hold of the CPU when it wants it.
Originally, I was just going to adjust the nice of hald-addon-input.
But it is probably all connected somehow.

Second, kernel process events/0 will be reniced to -19.

I do not know if this is the optimal method for solving the problem.
However, it seemed to get the lead out of my box.
The fixes will go out in the next LAG=0 grimoire.

</PRE>
