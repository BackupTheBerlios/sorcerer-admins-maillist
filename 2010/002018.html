Hi Kyle,

pls see comments below... :)

um... I have a small farm ( a pile, actually) of old K62-350's and 450's
(And some 386DX-33/50/66's too). Personally, I would rather see you
support the archaic machines while moving forward w/full steam on
x86_64, at the expense of the middle option and not looking back. I
kinda see that as visionary.

I mean, it's not like they've made 32 bit machines for years now anyway,
and like you point out, most everything now doesn't require a multi-lib.

For example, I've been relatively happy (um... that means no crashes)
the w/64 bit flash plugin, my Java works fine (even javaws), and screw
Adobe, coz I typically use Okular Krita, or XPDF instead of reader anyway.

For those times when I must have Dreamweaver, Flash, or Quickbooks, I
proudly proclaim my VirtualBox guest installation of Wyndoze 7 64.

Sadly, but also fortunately there aren't more apps in this category, I
miss my Skype - for everything else I have my own OpenFire XMPP server
w/plugins for just about everything, and I 'think' I can even get skype
back up and functional via my jabber client(s) via an Asterisk plugin
for Openfire, but for the time being, I just use Skype for chatting in
VirtualBox under wyndoze and call forward everything through my
GoogleVoice or Asterisk servers.

As far as your take on the performance benchmarks of Sorcerer x86_64
over that of IA32, well, I'm both impressed with the granularity of your
comparisons (always a pleasure to read your take on things), and
disappointed that you aren't realizing about a third improvement over
many aspects of a 32 bit Sorcerer system.

Eric Hamileers and Robby Workman had to work on Patrick for a while, but
when they presented some benchmarks of Slamd64 and some of their own
ports, they finally sold Pat on the notion of a pure Slackware64.

IMNSHO, most of us can live w/o much of the legacy stuff which is going
to come around anyway shortly, and bridge the gaps w/virtual machines
for convenience-sake.

But going back to those old boxes, I would like to see you continue to
support them - and not just because I'm one of those idiots that fires
up 64K IBM 5150's, 3270_AT's, Commodore64's, Trash-80's, and Timex
Sinclairs to prove I still can (I have an ample supply of 8bit ISA NICs
too, for the years to come) - but because many old Pentiums, 486's, and
even 386's have utility and can fill niches.

Okay Johnny - Flame on! ;)
