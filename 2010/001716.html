<PRE>I am glad the fix worked.
I am still testing linux version 2.6.34.1
I am feeling reassured the problem is fixed.
Thanks.

We owe Evert some thanks for going
through the nasty effort of testing a large selection
of software from the I/R
My boxes have been full load for ages.
There is just so much to retest following the change
from sentinel to destdir.
I am still encountering and fixing buggy spells,
but about half the spells I fix Evert reports first.  :)

This problem with the linux spells, for example,
would have persisted for almost a week longer.
Just today I was mining the Internet for new versions of software.
So I would have eventually tested the newer linux
and spot the problem.
However, problems with many spells will not be fixed
until after newer versions are discovered and check into the grimoire.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Currently, the havoc of the transition persists to an unknown degree.
Therefore, I do not recommend rebuilding production boxes.
But as usual if problems are encountered
then please report the problems in order to gain prompt fixes.

Surfing the inbound waves of
free software makes for a turbulent ride.
Not since the bad advise to install gettext's library
instead of using glibc's implementation
has there been anything close to a complete wipeout.
But back then a number of SAs did elect
to do a fresh install rather than try to untangle that
library from their boxes.
Yet in spite of that the oldest deployed Sorcerer boxes
are indeed 10 years old.

Although about 5% of the problems Sorcerer are introduced
by Sorcerer developers many problems occur due to
software authors.
For example, I just a few hours ago noticed that opal
was not compiling following the ffmpeg update.
But fortunately, I am now also testing a newer version of opal.
I am hoping for success.
Similarly Evert discovered a potential problem
that might be distribution wide involving the
compilation of qt-x11-opensource.

So in general at any given time up to around 5%
of the software in the grimoire might be broke.
The most frequently updated software that
also tends to be the most frequently installed software
tends to be in good condition and compiles and installs fine.
So the overall feel of Sorcerer is that for most boxes
errors during compilation are encountered for less
than 1% of installed software.

Additionally, some errors only happen on boxes
with specific software loadouts.
Consequently, some errors will not be detected during testing.
Therefore, please report errors when encountered
along with as much information as seems prudent to
isolate, identify, and fix the problem.

Normally, I detect and correct the majority
of errors without bug reports.
But on weeks with lots of good reports rolling in
then the majority of fixes will originate from the bug reports.
Personally, I prefer the team effort approach.
Anyone running a Sorcerer box is on the team.
So team-members, if you encounter errors
then please report them for prompt fixes.

Thanks for bearing with us during the transition
from sentinel to destdir.
