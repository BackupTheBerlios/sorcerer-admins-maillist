Would be nice to run it for about a decade.
Having more cores is nice, but speed wise
a 3X increase over my old workstation is
does not seem significant.
Probably the people who will like the newer boxes most
will be the gamers since the DDR5 graphics cards on
PCI-E seem far faster than technology 5 years ago.

The free drivers do not support OpenGL on the newer chipsets.
And without OpenGL there is no compositing.
It makes the graphics card not much different than
a SVGA with a serious load out of RAM.

Ironically, now that the new graphics card is in the case
no matter what I try
I can not convince it to go on a power diet.
It's nearly unquenchable desire has the power supply fan going at full blast.
The noise is horrible.
Maybe I should buy a power supply with a larger wattage rating?
I am uncertain.
What I am certain about is that the noise makes thinking more difficult.

5 drives, 125 watt CPU, 1 DDR3, and a graphics card in a PCI-E
aught not be pushing the power supply so hard.
Yet the power supply is producing more noise and more heat
than anything else in the case.
I suppose I could change it now or 6 months from now,
but it neither feels nor sounds like it can last a year
the way it is running now.
