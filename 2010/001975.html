&gt;<i> From the linux-custom camp:

</I>
Yet that is a 4 edged swords.
Drivers that go buggy are more easily handled
by unloading and reloading modules.
Without that...
Then again, some driver modules can not be unloaded,
because they are in use.
In the past while using a custom kernel configuration
I was able to do a nice mix of modules and monolithic drivers.
An entirely monolithic kernel might be a bit faster and secure,
but has that down side of requiring a reboot
when something unexpected happens.


&gt;<i> It also offers the ability to explicitly turn off hardware that is not
</I>&gt;<i> required/dodgey.
</I>
Many drivers are buggy.
At least for the ones that are not needed for installed hardware
those modules are not loaded into the modular kernel.
Therefore, buggy drivers are not normally a problem
if they are not loaded modules.


&gt;<i> So it's well worth the time tuning the config for linux-custom.
</I>
It is difficult to feel otherwise.
Then again being able to plug in my camera and
have it detected as a USB mass storage device
and have everything set up for it automatically
was a great feeling also.
I never had to know exactly what modules would
have to be loaded in order for that to work.
Even today I am still not certain because
I have not made time to look and compare.


&gt;<i> This localmodconfig thing looks like it could be a great help for linux-custom.
</I>
I agree.
But it also might be a one way ticket on a train
that is destined to derail someday when required
drivers/modules become renamed or deprecated.

&gt;<i> It requires building the full linux spell, booting it
</I>&gt;<i> once, and then updating the linux config spell, right?
</I>
Technically, one could boot the rescue kernel
or use the kernel provided from the Install/Rescue disk
after Sorcerer is installed.
Therefore, doing a compilation of linux is optional.
However, a kernel provided by linux must be running
when doing that make target
otherwise one can only expect to receive modules
for the modules that are loaded.


&gt;<i>I have trouble
</I>&gt;<i> seeing how it would help someone running the linux spell, apart from
</I>&gt;<i> helping that person cast the linux-custom spell. &#160;:)
</I>
Yes.
That odd, but potentially useful make target
is definitely aimed at scratching the itch of
the wanna be cowboy SA who wishes to convert
from a very complete modular kernel
to a far more precise configuration that compiles
only the modules required for that specific box.


&gt;<i> hmm.....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems worth the trouble on a build box where the hardware is not
</I>&gt;<i> going to change for years and years, but the kernel might be re-built
</I>&gt;<i> a few times.
</I>
On one hand a decent lucky box might be good to go for many years
of continuous use.
On the other hand one might pry the fixed disk out of a
smoldering chassis or from backups and then want
to run it on a machine with different and/or perhaps better hardware.

As long as the box also has a rescue kernel installed
and initramfs support enabled
then whatever the linux-custom configuration would not matter.
The old fixed disk could be booted in newer hardware provided
that the rescue kernel and rescue initramfs are used.

For that reason more so than any
I have a difficult time finding any indisputable reason
against using linux-custom provided that the SA
can manage to create a usable .config that works
with all the hardware they want.

As for me, I am still feeling too lazy to not use the linux spell.
Maybe I might make a single exception on one box.
If the box was a laptop with limited disk space
then that might be a good choice for linux-custom
if clearly no new or unusual hardware was expected
to be used on the laptop.
I have no idea how many people save their laptop fixed disks.
And aside from a RAM upgrade not much else about a laptop's
internal hardware should be expected to change.
That is why I conjecture it to be a good choice.

I want to say that the use of linux-custom and also
the decision to use it is entirely a matter of opinion and preference.
There are clearly boons and banes,
but none that make it clearly a right or wrong decision.
Although I can conjecture many situations that favor one
way or the other I have difficulty conjecturing a definition situaton
where one or the other must be used.

However, if one had to administrate and update 100 laptops
and they all have different configurations
and the users like to plug all sorts of things into them
then the modular linux spell starts to become a clear choice.
Overall the linux spell should require less SA effort than linux-custom
even after linux-custom is improved with that new make target.

So I would have to say that when a SA has more computers
to administrate than they can count on one hand using binary
then the full service linux spell starts to seem indispensable.


&gt;<i> Saying all that, the linux spell has the benefit that you just don't
</I>&gt;<i> have to care about what gets plugged into the machine, and also you
</I>&gt;<i> are able to run your linux on many different boxes... Ideal for
</I>&gt;<i> installers and people who don't rebuild/reboot their boxes all too
</I>&gt;<i> often.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm glad that we have the choice between lean and all-you-can-eat when
</I>&gt;<i> it comes to linux kernel in Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for all the hard work, Kyle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I normally have trouble figuring out whether [x] mean on or off.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What would have been helpful, would be consistency across the
</I>&gt;<i> spells... or, consider the following two equivalent spell options:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [ ] with $OPTION
</I>&gt;<i> [x] without $OPTION
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me that would mean this option is not run, right? If we make &quot;with&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;without&quot; standard across spells, then we could pick and choose
</I>&gt;<i> the defaults for spells without confusion.
</I>&gt;<i> -Evert-
</I>
This last part could be called a design flaw on my part.
I tried to go very close with what was in the ./configure --help
It is a bit difficult to explain.
With most spells the switches would be a parameter to configure.
Normally, the parameter would not be passed.
Most of those additional switches a SA would either
not want as parameters to ./configure
or would prefer the --without- variety that disables something.
Given that consideration then the way that switches normally works
for most spells makes sense.

However, with linux most SAs would normally want everything included.
And so they are being asked to explicitly state what should be omitted.
I could write it so it would be something like

switch WITH_NETDEV_1000 OMIT_NETDEV_1000  1000 Mbps network adapter drivers....

However, I opted for something slightly different.
The reason for that is because a SA might see
the linux configuration screen but accidentally
hit enter before coming to realization about what it is.
If the SA did that
then all those [ ] boxes would indicate that all those
categories of drivers should be omitted from compilation.
That is far more congruent with the way switches were intended to work.
However, it is way too dangerous for linux.

Is there any SA on the email list
that has not at least once held down enter
or tapped it a few extra times during
spell configuration in order to enable optionals
for software that is already installed?

Normally, a SA wants to expect
that they can go through all those configuration screens
and tap enter each time and have the outcome be okay.
And that is exactly the way it is now.
It is safe to tap enter.
It is only unsafe if the SA becomes confused
and does [x] in all those boxes and create a kernel
that lacks drivers for networking.

I want to give that more consideration
to see if there is an easy solution that
would help eliminate or further minimize
the possibility for confusion with linux configuration.
