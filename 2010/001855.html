<PRE>Hmm...

Interesting points....

I doubt Sorcerer checks whether a init script has successfully completed
before attempting to run the init script that depends upon it. What we need
as a very basic first step is a way for the init-scripts to be aware of the
other's init-scripts status.

What I have seen working for other OS's:

When a process starts it writes it's PID into a file.

Another init-script can then check whether it's requirement scripts are
running by reading the PID files for those processes and see if those PIDs
are still associated with the processes. If so, then it's safe to proceed.
If not, it can try to re-launch the process... if it gets a failed return,
then it can itself return a fail to the process calling it.

Once we have PID files, we can also write it's process status into that file
on a new line: Success, initializing, running or failed.

If a process, for whatever reason, re-starts, it should write it's new PID
into it's PID file in order to keep the PID valid.

What this means is that we have scripts that won't start if they have hard
requirements on other init processes.
Definitely, some processes are more vital for a running system than others.
Should a critical required component fail to start up, we should have an
automatic &quot;Press Ctrl-D for system maintenance&quot; thingie that I have been
seeing in RedHat and Solaris.


In a way, a lot of this behavior is already done by Sorcery in resolving
spell dependencies, and if we plan to change the init processes, I think we
should at least look at the lessons we have learned by having thousands of
spells, all inter-dependent and working properly with no two systems the
same. There are a lot of analogies between spells casting and init-scripts
executing.

&gt;<i> Hi!

</I>&gt;<i> - what is the aim of trying to continue starting a box that will fail? loss

</I>&gt;<i>    I means : a box relying on udev shall not even go further if this
</I>&gt;<i> service hasn't started, what might happens if other services try to do

</I>&gt;<i> the box if mdadm service hasn't started?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - what the aim of continue to have a service continue to run if a
</I>&gt;<i> requirement exit without notice?
</I>&gt;<i> - what the aim of trying to stop a service that hasn't started and print
</I>&gt;<i> error lines confusing the SA?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> services are dangerous because they can have sides effect much more later
</I>&gt;<i> than expected, some bug in a service can have side effect causing possible
</I>&gt;<i> loss of data, or un-startable box.... they then require special safety
</I>&gt;<i> solution. When you launch you favorite application, you assume that the
</I>&gt;<i> whole box is in order to work, NO? I can't make that assumption right now
</I>&gt;<i> with current design
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> regarding speed... I still believe that the overhead isn't that much as
</I>&gt;<i> kyle is saying.... what will we loss? 1? 2s? on a netbook? anyway using a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;super service&quot; process written in C/C++ using a client/server model and
</I>&gt;<i> then only communication through unix sockets, I'm confident that the cost
</I>&gt;<i> won't be ever noticeable...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> another point regarding speed :
</I>&gt;<i> say you have 5 starting services :
</I>&gt;<i> S00_1 : 10s
</I>&gt;<i> S00_2 : 50s
</I>&gt;<i> S01_3 : require S00_1, 1s
</I>&gt;<i> S01_4 : require S00_1, 30s
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> with current design using parallel start : S00 time : 50s, S01 time : 30s,
</I>&gt;<i> whole time 80s
</I>&gt;<i> with a start/stop controled on requirements : S01_4 total start (most time
</I>&gt;<i> consuming on the S00_1 branch) 10+30s = 40s,  S00_2 total time : 50s, whole
</I>&gt;<i> start time 50s......
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; 80s versus 50s, who is winner?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> another point regarding speed :
</I>&gt;<i> S00_1 : no requirement, might take 3s to fail
</I>&gt;<i> S01_2 : require S00_1, might take 40s to fail
</I>&gt;<i> S02_3 : require S01_2, might take 1s to fail
</I>&gt;<i> imagine now that S00_1 fails, in controled start way, S01_2, S02_3 won't
</I>&gt;<i> start and then won't consume resources, won't make the other S01* and S02*
</I>&gt;<i> wait (since the are waiting on their branches and not on a runlevel start
</I>&gt;<i> step), overall cost of the failure : 3s
</I>&gt;<i> now with the current design, S00_1 fails, cost 3s, we're moving to the S01
</I>&gt;<i> layer, S01_2 fails (because of S00_1) on integrated time out of 40s, cost :
</I>&gt;<i> 40s, moving to the S02 layer, S02_3 is started, fail, cost 1s.  OVERALL
</I>&gt;<i> start time 3+40+1 = 43s
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; 3s versus 43s.... wo is winner?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> controled start service is winner in both failure and success scenario....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> from my point of view service can look like the public swimming pool
</I>&gt;<i> analogy :
</I>&gt;<i> services are childs, fun, fast and running in a non controled manner across
</I>&gt;<i> the pool, you can take the assumption that all child behave well and then
</I>&gt;<i> just open the pool and let the childes play (this is current sorcerer init)
</I>&gt;<i> you don't have any overhead....
</I>&gt;<i> in real life, childes collides, some migth dye in the pool.... first try is
</I>&gt;<i> the automatic alarm (the red lines in the startup log) but as you might
</I>&gt;<i> know, if nobody listen to the alarm..... if you don't look each start/stop
</I>&gt;<i> time the logs, you might not notice something is going to be wrong.... it
</I>&gt;<i> might work 1 boot, 1 month, 1 year, you don't know....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> that's why in all pools there are safety gards, if they see a dangerous
</I>&gt;<i> thing they will stop the childs before irremediable damage occurs, they
</I>&gt;<i> might also save some child from drawing... if some service aren't started
</I>&gt;<i> (say the service &quot;fill the high jump pool with water&quot;) the safety team won't
</I>&gt;<i> let the childes access to the high jump service.... because some childes are
</I>&gt;<i> clever and won't try to jump and others are dumb or not careful and  will
</I>&gt;<i> assume that there is water....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> now let look at the case the high jump is open, for some reason, the &quot;fill
</I>&gt;<i> the high jump pool with water&quot; trigger an emergency.... the safety team
</I>&gt;<i> shall take all the childes using the high jump and ask them to stop using
</I>&gt;<i> that service.... in current sorcerer, the childes will continue to jump.....
</I>&gt;<i> it might or not work... who knows?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the only way to have the alarm be meaningful is to always have the lines
</I>&gt;<i> green.... a red line shall stop the process and ask for fixe.... and at
</I>&gt;<i> least prevent users to start....
</I>&gt;<i> the only way to have the service not try to jump from the high jump in an
</I>&gt;<i> empty pool is the safety team ie that lock controlled startup process....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> controlled startup process will have both gain in term of startup speed and
</I>&gt;<i> service reliability....

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Having a serial init is very useful for fine-tuning the boot process,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; though. It is definitely something that should be available, just not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; default.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I only use the serial init-script execution runlevels.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The chaos is not worth the extra measure of speed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When I re-designed init-scripts to be LSB compliant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by coincidence more than design I realized that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the introduction of runlevel steps allowed for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some easy parallel execution of init-scripts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course first attempts at using it turned out sloppy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Lines were not being printed entirely at once and therefore
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> separate lines from different init-scripts could chop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each other apart and look weird.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That aside it worked.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And the problem with chopped up lines was solved years ago.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Back in my Debian days,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debian used init-scripts written in perl.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am uncertain if I would describe booting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as slow or as entertaining.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, these days probably both Debian and Sorcerer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use the DASH shell for executing most init-scripts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DASH is like BASH, but lighter and therefore bit faster to start.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are limitations and differences between DASH and BASH.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And there are differences between Sorcerer and Debian.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But overall if both distros are sticking to a light alternative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to running init-scripts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then I expect boot speed should be similar.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At the runlevels 3 5 Debian will probably boot faster
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just for having reversed definition for those run levels.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Likweise 2 and 4 will probably be faster for Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yet overall I do not have much concern about it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Someone can always come up with a faster booting method
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if they are willing to make some sacrifices.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Considering how init-scripts during
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sysinit are not executed in parallel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and how parallel execution of init-scripts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> during runlevels can be improved
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am impelled to say that Sorcerer init design
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is about providing robustness rather than speed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, the decision to not use lockfiles
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> during init-script execution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has become reason for some people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to conjecture that Sorcerer's init is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> focused upon speed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yet looking at the 40 line script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/prc
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that controls the execution of init-scripts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> during runlevel demonstrates that the Sorcerer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> design emphasizes simplicity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps the a more true perspective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that acknowledges all these facts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is that Sorcerer's init-design is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an attempt to make an adequate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compromise between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> robustness, speed, and simplicity?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It might lack complexity and control
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it certainly does not lack the ability to boot our boxes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If not for the code for parallel execution of init-scripts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then /etc/init.d/prc could be 25 lines or less
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which makes for much easier reading on a console.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To me those extra 25 lines are already a compromise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of simplicity for added speed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps simplicity above all is most important during booting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If booting does require debugging
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then not having to have a PhD. in CS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and a day to look at sources is a greater boon
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than having a wickedly fast C program
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which controls init-script execution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet is bugged up while reading
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something unexpected in an init-script.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorcerer SAs are more skilled than an average simian
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but that is no reason why the method of init-script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> execution should be so complex that

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we monkey around with the init-script execution method
