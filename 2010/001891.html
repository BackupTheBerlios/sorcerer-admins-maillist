<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Good news is that grimoire does includes Dev86 (why its spell name got 
</I>a
&gt;<i> &gt; capitalised D, should it be just dev86?), i founded it and casted it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # grep source /root/.sorcery/grimoire/Dev86
</I>&gt;<i>     source <A HREF="http://www.debath.co.uk/dev86/Dev86src-$VERSION.tar.gz">http://www.debath.co.uk/dev86/Dev86src-$VERSION.tar.gz</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why does the software author have capitalize the 'd' in the tarball 
</I>name?

No idea. Some uses dev86 and some people calls its Dev86. 
Its difficult to say because its homepage does not tell much about it.

&gt;<i> &gt; 3. problem. Then i noticed several problems with Dev86 spell. It does 
</I>not
&gt;<i> &gt; install those required binaries, like bcc, bcc-cpp, bcc-cc1, copt and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unproto what lilo is trying to use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will try recasting Dev86 to see what the problem might be.
</I>&gt;<i> No problem.
</I>&gt;<i> The install log for Dev86 was the same as before.
</I>&gt;<i> # diff /etc/sorcery/log/install/Dev86 Dev86
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # augur install Dev86 | grep /usr/bin/bcc
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/bin/bcc
</I>
I think problem is newer DESTDIR based compile. I think Dev86 sets some 
prefixes that it uses to wrong location, based on DESTDIR, so after we 
install Dev86, it still assumes those are located at 
/usr/src/sorcery/.destdir/... and so on...
lilo compile log tells me:
------------8&lt;------------
bcc -Md -ansi -I.. -I/usr/lib/bcc/include -c -O -DHAS_VERSION_H 
-DHAS_LIBDEVMAPPER_H -DLILO=0xbb920890 -DLCF_BDATA -DLCF_DSECS=3 
-DLCF_EVMS -DLCF_IGNORECASE -DLCF_LVM -DLCF_NOKEYBOARD -DLCF_ONE_SHOT 
-DLCF_PASS160 -DLCF_REISERFS -DLCF_REWRITE_TABLE -DLCF_SOLO_CHAIN 
-DLCF_VERSION -DLCF_VIRTUAL -DLCF_MDPRAID -DLCF_DEVMAPPER -o lilo.o 
../lilo.c
Unable to execute bcc-cpp.
------------8&lt;------------

&gt;<i> &gt; What i would like to see is that we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; switch over GRUB2, it looks promising and its what all major distros 
</I>uses,
&gt;<i> &gt; it's been maintained and developed actively and it got more features 
</I>than
&gt;<i> &gt; lilo can provide.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Last I looked the new grub was also considered unstable.
</I>
Nowdays its a default on eg. Ubuntu, which is widely used distro, also 
Debian (Squeeze) is switching to use it too.
Its been actively developed and maintained, which lilo nor legacy-grub is. 
Thats a default win for GRUB2 :-)
It has some features that are missing and maybe its not tested yet so much 
as legacy-grub but you cant deny thats the road to go.

Take a look this page: <A HREF="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2</A> it has some 
info about it.

&gt;<i> It might also be a tad bit easier to mis-install it
</I>&gt;<i> since it does not use /dev device names.
</I>
It uses UUIDs. I think there is still some uses disk+partition scheme too, 
which is confusing. 

&gt;<i> My challenge about grub is still the same.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not use it and so I do not know how to
</I>&gt;<i> integrate it with sorcery's init-scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if someone writes decent init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> that work as good as those for lilo
</I>&gt;<i> then it would be possible to add grub as an option.
</I>
Indeed, its not a easy task to handle GRUB2 configuration scripts, because 
if you do it wrong, your box does not boot anymore.

Anyway, as lilo developments is kinda dead nowdays, its just matter of 
time we have to switch some other bootloader. 

One big reason is that uEFI BIOSes are coming, i mean, on server side, 
uEFI is _standard_ nowdays, has been year ot two, atleast on IBM stuff. 

Since GPT is also part of uEFI specs, you cant use LILO there, so, we are 
actually not even supporting todays servers fully. We are using their 
legacy boot modes nowdays. 

Legacy modes works, not a problem for now, but we are steadily making old 
BIOS obsolete and switch over to uEFI completely and thats scenario where 
you can't use LILO because its missing support. afaik if you have over 2TB 
drives you need to use GPT. I dont have a clue what lilo does if you have 
more than 2TB drive?

Not saying GRUB2 works perfectly on uEFI systems, but it has GPT support, 
LILO does not have (?).
