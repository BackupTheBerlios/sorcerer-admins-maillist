That is because most Sorcerer boxes have been
deployed longer than 3 years.
Still a SA can update the boxes.
I have Sorcerer boxes going on 10 years old,
but they still use the modular linux kernels.


&gt;<i> Well, newest ones that are serving Sorcerer project are running modular

</I>
:<i>)  Even better than that it works out of box.
</I>Talk about an easy install, right?


&gt;<i> Not sure if you can install anymore old linux spell when installing.
</I>
A senior level SA has a 50/50 chance of being able to
create a custom .config that works
maybe even better if they use that linux make target
that generates a config based upon loaded modules.


&gt;<i> I like old spell much more than modular version because there is absolutely

</I>&gt;<i> also your /boot partition size

</I>
The increase in /boot size also was a concern for me.
And we have discussed several compromises such as
omitting certain categories of drivers from the initramfs
such as networking modules if networking does not have
to start during sysinit.  And also audio modules.

For most boxes the cost of using modular kernels is
a 1G /boot and 2-10 seconds larger boot time.
60 seconds after the runlevel begins the initramfs
is discarded from memory.
Therefore, no additional persistent memory consumption
exists for booting from initramfs.

&gt;<i> I can understand why its (modular) been done but its not only way to boot
</I>&gt;<i> Linux.
</I>
True.
I tried creating a bloated kernel that
contained all filesystem drivers and
all disk device drivers, IDE, SCSI, SATA, PATA, etc...
It was too big to boot.
And it would have wasted RAM for all those drivers if it did work.

Another option is to create custom configs for boxes
based upon the output:
# make localmodconfig
But will SAs flame me when the .config automatically
generated from that stops working after updates?
The probability of that .config becoming useless is too high.
Boxes must be able to boot.
And SAs do not always reboot after a kernel update
to see if the box is still able to boot with installed kernels.
So going this road could lead to a box that must be booted
with an Install/Rescue disk and then manually rescued.
Not to mention if the SA plugs in a removable device
the plug 'n pray will be plug and NOTHING happens,
because there is no compiled kernel module to load for the device.
Oh, boy, boxes boot fast, but sure are useless.

Another option is to have the initramfs split into two initramfs.
One initramfs can contain the version specific kernel modules.
Yet a separate initramfs that contains /bin /lib /lib64 /sbin
can exist and be used in common when booting all kernels.
Unfortunately, that requires a loader such as grub
which supports the use of multiple initramfs images.
lilo is an awesome loader, but only loads one initramfs.
And I did not want to make time to hack lilo improvements,
although I did look at the relevant code in lilo.
And of course we have a nearly yearly discussion about
why or why not to use grub.

So the compromise I selected which still requires a 1G /boot
is to provide the fast initramfs image that is created
automatically while booting.
If initramfs images do not require regeneration
then booting can happen using the image in /boot/fast/
The initramfs in /boot/fast/ has only the files required
in order to move the box smoothly and quickly through sysinit.
It boots at nearly the same speed as would
a box that has a monolithic kernel.


Now here is a new compromise I can suggest
that I only half expect might work.
I can create a linux-monolthic spell.
And I can have it craft a .config using that:
# make localmodconfig
and attempt to change the modules into compiled in drivers.
But it probably will not work
and it will eventually lead down a dead end street.
But before putting forth the effort to create that spell
and make it work
I would like someone to test and show that
there is a significant gain for using a monolithic kernel.
Otherwise, I am merely creating a noose for Sorcerer SAs.
