<PRE>udev 149 is now finally ready for use.
Please direct all flames and constructive criticism to the udev
email list for starting their helper scripts with:

#!/bin/sh -e

The -e parameter tells the shell script execution to exit immediately
when a command returns with non zero exit.
Consequently, their scripts end without warning nor notice as soon
as they encounter something that the script author did not properly anticipate.
The grimoire update that re-installs coreutils
with /usr/bin/uname moved to /bin/uname avoids
/lib/udev/firmware.sh script aborting prematurely
without any warning when it attempts to execute uname.
It even executes $( uname -r ) twice instead of just once
in order to make that script run extra-extra slow.
However, running uname should not even be required.
First, firmware is stored in /lib/firmware/ and not /lib/firmware/$( uname -r )
And second the version of the running kernel is already easily available
from read REPLY &lt; /proc/version and chopping it on the dotted lines.

This bug has been occurring for the 149 and 146 version of udev.
For any SAs holding udev back to 142 or lower
then now is safe to update udev.

The problems caused by udev 144 and newer
was that firmware can not be automatically loaded for devices
when their modules are loaded.
This could also cause udevadm settle to reach the full 180 second timeout
following the cold plug event re-triggering.
And the last annoying aspect of this problem was that it required devices
that were not working properly to have their modules unloaded and reload
after the real root filesystem was mounted in order for required firmware
to also be loaded.

Sorry this took me a while to full investigate.
It required about 8 hours total, and 4 non stop
a few days ago as I trekked through kernel and kernel module code
and back to udev while learning how firmware is supposed to
be automatically loaded.

I am pleased this problem is solved and will not persist with 2010 I/R releases.

However, sometime following linux version 2.6.30.4 some changes
were made in linux that caused some devices to no longer work properly.
I am using legacy version progress for linux on one of my boxes in order
to keep a USB NIC from turning into a purposeless paperweight.
I have no clues about why that is not working at the moment.
I have a different box that uses a different USB NIC and different
kernel modules
and it runs fine with linux version 2.6.32.2
Is anyone else holding back the installed version of linux or linux-modular
for similar hardware support issues?
