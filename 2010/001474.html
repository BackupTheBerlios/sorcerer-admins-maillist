<PRE>Aside from using konsole and kitten
the other kde programs I do not explicitly use.
However, overall the desktop seems stable.
Today, I have been working on creating additional spells
for the new optional requirements.
Since mostly they are new features it does not matter
if they are included in most people's KDE 4.4.0 compilation.
However, it is good to have it done before KDE 4.4.1
when probably many of the bugs will be removed and
new features might be ready for use.

As expected the KDE 4.3.x to 4.4.x upgrade required
some significant changes.
qt-x11-opensource is already obsolete.
qt-everywhere-opensource is replacing it.
In addition other spells had to be written
in order to satisfy absolute requirements.
The changes are not as significant as the 3.x to 4.x transition,
however enough has changed in order to expect some new
bugs and instability while using the 4.4.0 release.

At first with KDE 4.4.0's requirement upon an unreleased
version of phonon that is only available from svn
gave me cause to wonder wondered
if KDE 4.4.0 should be made available
in the Sorcerer grimoire.
But I expected someone would mention it
if I intentionally neglected it.
Unfortunately, the change is significant enough
so that merely adding legacy version progress
to the kde-v4 spells would be insufficient to
block the transition.
However, merely holding those spells at their current
versions should be sufficient if it is an absolute must.
Probably the KDE 4.4.1 release will be less than 2 months away.

I do not want to imply that I am dissatisfied with kde 4.4.0,
but it did require more effort than usual to make the upgrade.
Why they did not release a new phonon source when
newer phonon is obviously required is unexpected.
But that deduction only required about 8 hours of CPU time
on the test box to discover
that qt provided phonon would be insufficient.

Due to the crash of konsole on my workstation
I posted my previous thoughts about kde 4.4.0
possibly having some inconvenient bugs.
Depending upon what a user or SA is doing with their konsoles,
having them all snap shut at once could result in a loss
of several hours of productivity.
The bug is such that
it might not be easily reproducible upon demand.
I expect only a 50% chance it will be fixed by version 4.4.1
But sometimes we must take the good with the bad
and brace ourselves for the unfortunate.
Fixed disks for example are a great boon compared
to the storage capacity of a floppy disk.
But they also occasionally crash.
To be prepared for that eventuality is the next
best substitute for a bernoulli drive.
I wonder why those never became more popular.

Oh, I remember one thing related to your implied question.
kdenetworks-v4 has an optional requirement on NetworkManager.
However, that still does not compile,
probably due to the sorry state of the availability of libnl tarballs.
The original libnl website is long gone for more than a year,
and the replacement website does not
supply current libnl tarballs
even when the state on their website
that they know the tarballs that they supply are old.
If they do not care about their software project
then why should I?
With that single consideration cast aside,
soon if not already all the absolute and optional requirements
for most of KDE's SA tools should be in the grimoire.
Many sources compile with:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Congratulations! All external packages have been found.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorcerer's coverage of optional requirements is not 100%,
but it is not far from when considering KDE.
