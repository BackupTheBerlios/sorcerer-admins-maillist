<PRE>I did not intend to sound as if I was taking offense.
I did the best that I could to try to complete this before July.
But still problems are popping up.
A few Evert found.
I found a few also.
Not only does gtk+ install differently
when using a DESTDIR,
but so does pango.
So I wrote an additional spell for that.
And the newest gobject-introspection
is definitely not something we should use.
And I moved a few library installs to /lib
and libtool is kicking me in the butt for trying
to put the libraries in /lib and the .la files in /usr/lib.
The problems from libtool and trying to update
gobject-introspection cost a day to troubleshoot.

I have 100 spells in the queue,
about 70 of them are new source releases that I am testing.
I hope to have available soon a new release of kde-v4
and other spells.

Although I would not want to do a rebuild at this moment,
overall the transition is not going bad.
Leaped sorcery off the rails one day,
or maybe more, but that should update now.
And aside from what Evert reported the spells
I have been casting and testing have installed
fine using DESTDIR.
It is a transitions that
I both wish I had done sooner,
but am glad I did not do sooner,
because there would have been more problems.
I estimate that Monday
would be a good day to update dev boxes.
And if there are not problems
then Tuesday a good day to update production boxes.
A switch as large as going for sentinel to DESTDIR
is bound to cause a little instability,
but derailing sorcery had not happened in years,
until recently.   *sigh*
