<PRE>Hi

One giant bug report here. I am updating one older server and noticed that 
lilo does not compile.

1. bug, does not discover gcc is installed if your locale is something 
else than english. Current lilo logic is brain dead and its grepping 
&quot;version&quot; word from gcc version output, put if you happen to use some 
other locale, like i am using Finnish locale, its not &quot;version&quot; anymore, 
its localiced to my local language (its versio in finnish). So first is to 
fix force locale eg to LANG=C before you cast it, then it finds your gcc 
(it has some wierd code to discover if you have gcc). 

2. problem. I am not sure but on my older sorcerer installation lilo does 
want to use bcc command, but it should be recomended only, not sure whats 
different as i tested on sorcerer test server (its newer installation, 
installed on this year), it compiles fine without bcc, but on this other 
server i am getting compile time error because bcc is missing... lilo 
spell requires bin86, but bin86 does not provides bcc and those other 
binaries if bcc is installed - afaik then lilo needs dev86 not bin86.

Good news is that grimoire does includes Dev86 (why its spell name got a 
capitalised D, should it be just dev86?), i founded it and casted it. 

3. problem. Then i noticed several problems with Dev86 spell. It does not 
install those required binaries, like bcc, bcc-cpp, bcc-cc1, copt and 
unproto what lilo is trying to use.

If you manually compile dev86 and copy those needed binaries to 
/usr/local/bin you notice then that those missing binaries needs more 
files that current spell does also not install. Lots of files that should 
go to /usr/lib/bcc (i think), but current spell does not even make 
/usr/lib/bcc -dir. 
So you manully need to copy those missing files to: 
/usr/src/sorcery/.destdir/Dev86/usr/lib/bcc (wierd). 

I managed to compile newer lilo, but i haven't try to boot it yet, those 
pesky udev problems leaves usually /dev empty if udev version and linux 
kernel does not match, thats one big problem also when you have older 
installation like i have. Several servers installed many years ago, and 
when i needed to update it, because security problems and need for new 
features, etc. its big pain to update and nervous business to boot them if 
you need newer kernel, because many installations i have here has been 
bugged with udev problem. Has anyone else managed to get problems if you 
use older installation and you update your system and after reboot its 
boot goes broke, like almost all files are missing from /dev?

Anyway, Is lilo even maintained anymore? What i would like to see is that 
we switch over GRUB2, it looks promising and its what all major distros 
uses, it's been maintained and developed actively and it got more features 
than lilo can provide.
