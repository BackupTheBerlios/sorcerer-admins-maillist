<PRE>Usually, lilo is okay.
If it prints LI 99 99 99 99 or something like that
then the problem is not normally salvageable without an I/R
Probably more common problems might be:
lilo does not re-install properly;
an update installs init-scripts with bad bugs;
a freshly updated udev is destined to bite the bullet.

Consequently, I am introducing a new spell called sorcerer-rescue.
This might ease SA apprehension during a reboot following an update.
sorcerer-rescue downloads an Install/Rescue iso9660
appropriate for the architecture.
Then, it extracts files from it.
Finally, it installs the /boot/*/{System.map,initrf,linux}
from the Install/Rescue disk into /boot/rescue/

The /etc/init.d/{intramfs,lilo} have also been adjusted
to work with this change.
Generated /etc/lilo.conf should contain
the label for rescue following the normal entries
and before /etc/lilo/tail is added.
Unlike the other entries,
booting of the rescue image
has a mandatory password requirement.

Booting the rescue image will not automatically rescue a box.
It will ask the for the root partition.
Provided those two questions are answered correctly
then it should boot the box with the real root filesystem mounted.
This is a bit easier than hunting for an Install/Rescue disk
and a removable USB CDROM drive.

The beauty of the /boot/rescue/* is that it should stay put on disk.
Once lilo is successfully installed with a /boot/rescue/ present
then that lilo entry will probably always point to the proper
location on disk for booting /boot/rescue/

Let us assume that something is improper about /etc/lilo.conf
Therefore, lilo refuses to re-install.
However, if the initramfs images /boot/2.6.*/initrf were updated
then the installed lilo will probably be
unable to boot almost all of the labels.
In contrast /boot/rescue/initrf will not have updated.
And /boot/rescue/{linux,initrf} should still be at their
same location on disk.
Therefore, the installed lilo should be able to boot them.
Therefore, that should enable a SA
to easily escape from that potential problem.


I started thinking of this idea back during
the discussion about how to make Sorcerer booting more robust.
Then, I succumbed to a bad head cold.
Maybe that worked for the better?
I wanted something where the majority of benefit
could be applied to existing Sorcerer boxes.
This seems to be a good compromise.

My original idea was that Sorcerer boxes should have
the I/R installed on it's own partition with it's own lilo.
That way the lilo from the I/R could run first.
It would present a default option to chain to the lilo in /boot or /
However a mandatory password protected secondary option
would exist for rescue.
The most obvious drawbacks to that method are the requirements
for a 700M reserved partition and a fresh installation.
In contrast a method which merely adds the rescue label
to the default lilo menu does not require an additional partition,
no chaining of bootloaders, about 40M to 50M on /boot/,
and no new installation to receive the benefit.
Not bad a bad compromise, yes?

However, it can not protect against the very worst type of
lilo error or if something eliminates/overwrites the installed lilo.
Generally, if something wrecks the installation of lilo,
especially if that installation was in the MBR,
then whatever caused that problem would also wreck grub.

If /boot/rescue/ is installed by sorcerer-rescue
then it will probably be available to boot
even if other labels are incorrect or not booting properly.
Booting the rescue label should be no more problematic
than booting the current Install/Rescue disk
since the contents of /boot/rescue/ comes
from the current Install/Rescue disk.
Therefore, this solution should satisfactorily increase
boot robustness at no cost in performance
and at a very minimal increase in disk usage.

I wanted to include the added information about
the reasoning, rethinking, re-evaluation,
and consideration about the costs and benefits
because it demonstrates something important.
Sometimes an initial idea is good,
but it might not be good enough
or it might be too costly
or not provide enough benefit.

I was willing to reject my original idea.
I did reject it.
Having two lilo installed is too confusing.
Having 700M reserved partition for an I/R seems wasteful.
If I can boot a box and must
fix installed software such as gcc
and lack a previous archive for it
then I would probably scp that archive from a different box.
Normally, nobody would want to import a set of archives
from an I/R after a box has been deployed and updated
for a month or longer.
Consequently, I admitted to these flaws
that blew big holes through my glorious plan of creating
Sorcerer boxes with incredibly robust booting.

My original idea was good.
However, by throwing it away
I was able to arrive at an implementation
that achieves most of the benefit for almost none of the cost.
This outcome is far better than
if I had implemented the initial idea.
Certainly a year later or less,
I would have decided that I introduced too much complexity
and could have achieved commensurate results
for less cost if I had granted more consideration
about what was important and how to achieve it.
Yet now I shall not have that regret.

In general what I can about myself regarding this improvement
can be said about any Sorcerer SA.
Great ideas happen.
They burn hot.
We become excited.
We want to push ahead with those ideas
often without careful consideration of boons and banes.
However, better results are usually obtained
for less effort upon careful thorough reconsideration
of what is desired and how to achieve the result
for a minimal increase of complexity.

More to the point I should state that many
good ideas about increasing the robustness of Sorcerer booting
have been discussed on the list this year.
The reason I have been the person who seems least excited
about those ideas is because I am also the person playing
the role of the devil's advocate and pointing out where
the costs in complexity and performance become too much.

Sometimes I have the insight to develop adequate implementations
for the good ideas provided by others.
This time, perhaps not.
Or perhaps inspiration will arrive many months or years from now.
Took a year to decide to revise init-scripts to LSB.
Required close to half a decade before
a recommended for an idea such as:
# cast --version $VER $SPELL
became possible to accomplish with
# augur progress $SPELL $VER; cast $SPELL

My point in providing that information is to support
the statement that a good idea remains a good idea.
Not all good ideas have adequate implementations
nor can be implemented with the current sorcery and Sorcerer.
However, with time, consideration, honing
then good ideas can return in the future
and along with awesome implementations.

Through creating and updating Sorcerer
I discovered through retrospect that less than 20%
of my ideas receive implementations.
And the ideas that are implemented eventually receive revision.
Almost nothing endures.
To see exactly how much it changes
one could examine a grimoire from
the same day on each year going all
the way back to 2000.
Merely the changes which becomes the evolution
of the definition of a spell are dramatic.

The reason I wrote all that is so that nobody
should feel devalued or put down who is trying
to contribute to Sorcerer.
Since the rejection and revision of ideas is the norm
then everyone who has had a majority of their ideas
rejected should feel the same as I do about it.
Better to have some good ideas than no ideas.  :)
If only 10% are implemented
then that is par for the course.
And even some of those become dust.

For example,
I liked the sentinel preload program that I wrote.
I enjoyed the convenience.
It was a clever program.
It was sufficient for many years.
But I killed it off!
Likewise I wrote sdelta, great program, but not good enough.
Killed it off.
Slew off sdelta2 also.
It had a very short life.
But because those died we now have sdelta3
which seems to do surprisingly good
at creating tiny patches to translate tarballs bit for bit.
sdelta was a great idea,
but the implementation required tremendous effort.

Sorcerer SAs have many great ideas.
But even great ideas can require enormous
effort before they are sufficiently honed
and their implementations and intended effects
exceed expectations.
The cost for transforming a good idea into
an implemented contribution requires the willingness
to throw away the idea, to whittle it down to the essential,
and to rebuild it as many times as necessary
to eventually achieve a result that has some hope
of enduring more than a year.

The cost might be greater than one intends to spend.
I can give an example of this.
A while before the transition over to the new
virtual hosting for Sorcerer I invested some effort
into trying to create a method for remotely
mounting and accessing a Sorcerer I/R across the Internet.
That way a minimally bootable I/R might contain
only contain a kernel and initramfs image.
However, when the I/R is mounted instead of
it being an I/R in CDROM drive it would be
an I/R hosted on a HTTP server and accessed
with byte-range requests.
I wrote a nifty fuse module for this.

I will skip a long discussion about it.
My point is that it is something almost no Sorcerer SA
knows about because I put a lot of effort into it
and the decided to leave it alone.
The idea of being able to have a less than 80M
kernel + initramfs Sorcerer Install/Rescue with
archives imported over Internet is still a cool idea.
Would be fun and convenient to be able to distribute
Sorcerer on CDs cut to the size and shape of business cards.
But for a while now I have allocated no further effort to that idea.
Just because an idea is good,
and can be accomplished
is not always sufficient to make it worthy.

Other examples of good ideas people had,
but relinquished doing on their own are ports
of Sorcerer to sparc, alpha, xbox, and powerpc,
and independent maintenance of documentation and grimoires.
Going from a good idea to an awesome implementation is tough.
Anyone who tries deserves a gold star.  :)
