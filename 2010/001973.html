<PRE>Nearly without exclusion all init-scripts source in /lib/lsb/init-functions.
That is a place where most of the code common to all init-scripts
has been factored out of init-scripts and placed in /lib/lsb/init-functions.
Therefore, deciding upon a common method for configuration files
for init-scripts also makes sense such as
/etc/init.d.conf/$INIT_SCRIPT
where $INIT_SCRIPT is the same name as the init-script being run

/etc/init.d/httpd
would have it's configuration file as:
/etc/init.d.conf/httpd
If /etc/init.d.conf/httpd
is present
then it would be automatically sourced in
when /lib/lsb/init-functions is sourced in.
Therefore, almost no change to existing init-scripts
would have to be made in order to support
the additional functionality for init-script configuration files.

Let us take /etc/init.d/loadkeys for example.
Well, actually, that init-scirpt would be good to go
with the new implementation without modification.
So not a great example.

But surely, there might be some init-script
where a variable expected to be sourced in
from a configuration file would have to be assigned
a default value before or while it is being used such as:

if start_daemon $SRV $OPTS ${DEFINES:-defaults}

and so forth.


Once we have a clear statement about
exactly what should require what in the
way of SA defined parameters/variables
Then we should have a better idea how to handle this.

A more generic approach might be to more simply
use a default variable name when only one variable is expected
to be set and also expected to be given as a parameter when
a service is started.

Perhaps

$EXTRA

Ideally, we should go with something
that is both flexible and yet not more complicated
than required for most scenarios.
Since init-scripts tend to be simple
in most cases if a SA would want to supply
additional information
then one variable might be reasonable.


How does this seem as a compromise?
This way with overall better init-scripts
then in most cases as SA would only have to
edit a single line in a file created in/etc/init.d.conf/
instead of creating a custom init-script.
In many respects it should be a bit more portable.
Even if an init-script changes, improves, or alters slightly
then the variable will still probably be usable from the configuration file.

The benefit to this method is that it is concise and fast.
The obviously flaw is that a change in an init-script's name
would cause an existing configuration file to have an incorrect name
unless the sorcery tools or SA manually fixed that.

The benefit of having separate configuration files instead
of many variables in a single file
provides benefits such as:

it reduces SA headache and information overload;
it allows for the use of a generic variable or generic variable array.
It should be a bit faster than repeatedly parsing a longer file
that sets many variables where normally each variable
is only used by a single init-script.

The banes:
SA must read /etc/init.d/README to discover
that configuration files are in /etc/init.d.conf/
But the benefit of having them in a different directory
allows for faster creation of symbolic links to init-scripts
and also a very simple rule for excluding /etc/init.d/
from being a place that stores customizable configuration files.
In other words the configuration files for init-scripts
would work best when stored in a different directory.

Configuration files for init-scripts could be stored in a separate directory
such as /etc/init.d.conf/ or /etc/init.d/conf/

The later version might or might not be more obvious.
It has the benefit of probably being seen when doing
a ls from within /etc/init.d/
Surmising what it contains might be less intuitive than
if a SA sees /etc/init.d/ and /etc/init.d.conf/ just below
on a ls of /etc/

If we go with this type of implementation
to provide configuration information for init-scripts
than I would like to hear who wants /etc/init.d.conf/
and who wants /etc/init.d/conf/ and reasons why.

I will add again that the sed statement to allow
files in /etc/init.d/conf/ to be customizable should be
slightly slower and also accessing files in /etc/init.d/conf/
should be slightly slower than accessing files in
/etc/init.d.conf/
The speed consideration is almost insignificant.
One might argue that one less directory in
/etc/ provides faster accessing of files and directories in /etc/
Configuration files for init-scripts
perhaps seem more at home in /etc/init.d/conf/
If it is not any less obvious to find or any less intuitive
then /etc/init.d/conf might provide a better location
just to keep all that stuff grouped together.
In a way it already follows the precedent set up
by the directories:
/etc/init.d/log.d/
/etc/init.d/dev.d/
If we called it
/etc/init.d/conf.d/
then it would fit in very nice, yes?
