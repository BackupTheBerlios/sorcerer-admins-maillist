My explicit offer to receive improved init-scripts is a standing offer.
The init-scripts provided by Sorcerer must be standard and not customized.
However, they can be improved to better accommodate SAs requirements.
If I see a sample of how someone modified a Sorcerer init-script
in order to create a custom init-script
then that might provide ideas about how to improve the original init-script.
Until I see examples of how SAs want to use/start those programs
then my assumptions about what is sufficient
might fall short of what SAs require.

Since I write Sorcerer init-scripts they might not excel
at anything except looking clean and concise.  :)
However, that might make for an easier/faster start
than editing a complex 300+ line init-script.
Perhaps that alone might encourage SAs?

When I encounter a 300+ line init-script
then I want to break it down, break it up, and totally rewrite it.
However, an init-script that is less than 25 lines
instead seems to invite me to easily add a line
here and there until it does precisely what I want.
Conversely, that also makes a good reason for SAs
to not email a suggestion about where
the SA changed or added one line to an init-script.

Sorcerer init-scripts have room for improvement
especially when improvements are realized and recommended
by the SAs who use the software in mission critical environments.

Customized init-scripts are forbidden.
However, custom init-scripts can be used
when that best suits a SAs purpose.
Yet, once a custom init-script is used
then the SA is entirely alone in the responsibility
for ensuring that the custom init-script continues to work as expected.

Customizable init-scripts is not a good compromise.
Again that still places SAs alone on their own
with no help and no clue
when the customized init-script quits working properly.
The best compromise is to examine SA's custom init-scripts
and decide how the Sorcerer provided init-script can be improved
to the extent that a custom init-script would not be required.

If the use of configuration files
can satisfy 50% or more of those situations
then that might provide a good solution.
Editing a configuration file is slightly faster and more convenient
than creating a custom spell.
Even so, adding a configuration file for a stock spell to use
can not be considered a 100% effective replacement
for any or all uses of a custom init-script.

Just because we can implement something such
as configuration files for init-scripts
is not alone sufficient reason to go ahead with it.
Having configuration files for init-scripts adds complexity.
However, since we have the idea up in the air
and clear to view for the moment
I want to suggest that we put together 5
custom spells to see exactly how they
were modified to become custom.
I will already nominate
/etc/init.d/loadkeys
because I can see how it would benefit
from having the keyboard mapping
specified in a separate file.

Once we see precisely where SAs would
want to customize stock spells
then we can better evaluate if the having
/etc/init.d/conf.d/
provides an adequate frequently useful extension.
Or does it become code that is rarely used
or something less appealing than using a custom spell.

I do not dislike the idea of having
/etc/init.d/conf.d/
However, I am already prejudiced to expect
that it would receive little or no use.
That makes sense because I wrote Sorcerer init-scripts
and currently they do not use anything like
/etc/init.d/conf.d/
In order to make that extension worthy,
welcome, and successful
we also should modify a handful of init-scripts or more
to  to receive a benefit.
Having an /etc/init.d/conf.d/ and code that uses it
merely wastes CPU cycles when no init-scripts use it.
It would be like a no-pet apartment building
with a park for dogs next to the parking lot for cars.
So we should adopt some dogs, init-scripts, first
before we build this dog park, /etc/init.d/conf.d/
That way we should have less of a surprise about
whether the outcome is commensurate with or
exceeds the effort.
