</I>Well, you did say that Sorcerer is running without a
/etc/init.d/config, and I'm just saying that a lot of the things
called during the init of a system has a config file already.

I don't want those files to be moved, either...  it has taken me long
enough to learn where they live, and the software authors also expect
their files in specific places.

So far, it looks like almost all the config files are somewhere in
/etc. Which is a good thing. I really can't think of a spell that
would benefit from having a config that does not already have a config
now.

There may be some room for improvement in the init-scripts, but is it
worth the effort to go scratching around there?

We really should just submit wanted changes to the init-scripts to
you, together with motivations and working code. :)

&gt;<i> Lines such as:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* Run /etc/init.d/loopback
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* loopback configuring &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [ warning ]
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* loopback configured &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;[ success ]
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* Ran /etc/init.d/loopback
</I>
This is a bit over the top, and not what I was suggesting at all. In
my example, it was expressed in one line, not four, which is half the
line length of the normal Sorcery init-script log.
In your example, it would be written to the log as:
init: /etc/init.d/loopback                                       [success]

The first part of the line already says you are calling the script, so
no need to say [warning]
The script returns it's status at the end of the line, and then it's
on to the next init script.

&gt;<i> Or perhaps printing
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S00loopback
</I>This is good too.
Now if we only could get the scripts to output their messages into the
logs as well, that would be fantastic... but that is for another time.

&gt;<i> would show more precisely
</I>&gt;<i> what is running and where a problem
</I>&gt;<i> might be happening if init-scripts are
</I>&gt;<i> being run in sequence.
</I>Ah, my suggestion only works for serial init.

In a parallel init, each script printing a status message should
identify itself, and look almost like what we are seeing today.

init: loopback
init: mount
mount: success
loopback: success

I dunno.. these are just ideas I wanted to run past you to make
troubleshooting troublesome init scripts easier.

My whole gripe with the current system is that init does not say what
it is trying to init in the logs, and there are some initscripts that
don't print anything in the logs either. Now, they are so very simple
that that are almost guaranteed never to fail. However, I might be
doing something completely unexpected to my system that might make
that script fail, and I would like to know where, exactly, things
started to go wrong.


&gt;<i> I did not have such information print
</I>&gt;<i> because it will make information during sysinit
</I>&gt;<i> and runlevel scroll faster and longer.
</I>&gt;<i> And the additional information is only useful
</I>&gt;<i> during serial execution of init-scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it does make sense to have it.
</I>
Well, if we did it this way:

init:   $INIT_SCRIPT
$INIT_SCRIPT: $EXIT_STATUS

we get the benefit that no script can hide by just not printing
anything to the log.
The logs will be exactly as long as they would have been if the init
scripts have all had a line for starting and a line for exit status.
And, like I said earlier, since the running initscript identifies
itself, a simple grep through the logs will put them together, if the
script outputs an exit status.
Who knows? you might learn something about the order in which events
actually happen versus the order that they were called in.

&gt;<i> When I go looking for a problem
</I>&gt;<i> I look for the problematic init-script
</I>&gt;<i> by grepping for text from log scroll
</I>&gt;<i> in files located in /etc/init.d/
</I>&gt;<i> to see which init-script can print it.
</I>&gt;<i> That lacks a certain eloquence and convenience.
</I>Yup, especially when that script is assumed to be so simple that it
cannot fail, and thus did not print an entry in the first place.

I could try this on my system first, and see how it goes...

I do a lot more rebooting than most, since I run Sorcerer on my
laptop, so I am more exposed to init-scripts, and I have to say that I
will be the prime benefactor as well, should we decide to make the
process more transparent.
