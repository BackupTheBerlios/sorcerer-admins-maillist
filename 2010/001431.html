</I>
That is curious.
The script for locating the I/R should check all removable media.
Perhaps it did not show up due to the BIOS
or due to the CDROM drive having some trouble
reading the disk at that time?

These are the commands:
  grep -l 1 /sys/block/*/removable |
  sed    's:/sys/block/:/dev/:
                      s:/removable::'

This is the output on the test box:

/dev/fd0
/dev/hdd

If you have an opportunity to try it again
would you please debug the /etc/init.d/find_ir script.
It might be doing something wrong,
but if it is that should be much easier to spot
on a box where the problem is happening.
Otherwise it will attempt 12 times over the course
of about a minute to mount the removable media.
That usually works even on somewhat faulty CDROMs


&gt;<i> But when trying to select device in the fstab menu, it would not load
</I>&gt;<i> anything. It can not list the devices, even though there is no problem when
</I>&gt;<i> selecting partition and formatting it with cfdisk.
</I>
What exactly was on the fstab menu?
It listed no
/dev/hda1
/dev/hda2
/dev/hda3
even if such partitions exist?

I should have seen this problem while testing
the I/R in qemu if it happens.


&gt;<i> To me it seems like that the menu-driven installer is broken (or at least
</I>&gt;<i> the menu item for modifying the fstab)
</I>
The virtual machine emulator might also be problematic.
I test the I/R using qemu.
If the disk can be partitioned
and the fstab menu displays no partitions
then that is an unexpected problem.
Usually, after a disk is partitioned
udev will pick up on those changes
and automatically create the partitions in /dev/
Is it possible that the disk was partitioned,
yet the partitioning program was exited without
saving the changes to disk?
Did /dev/ really lack /dev/hda1 and other device nodes
for partitions?
Was udevd still running?

Since I was unable to create this type of error while
testing the I/R I suspect that the answers will be found
if the problems are re-created again the same way as
you did before using the same virtual machine emulator.
I also recommend giving it a test with qemu in order to
eliminate the possibility that the virtual machine emulator
is causing the problem.

I appreciate the bug report.
I agree that in your circumstance it is not installable.
However, I am still curious to know why it is so.
The cause of these bugs might not be the menu driven installer.
It could be the virtual machine emulator.

When I test the I/R I test it using qemu with the CDROM
image file and not a real physical CDROM.
Consequently, qemu emulates a CDROM device.
This gives good results and eliminates the possibility
of physical media read error or quirky having a quirky CDROM drive.
If you want to emulate the virtual machine
then I also recommend emulating the CDROM
and using the ISO9660 image directly
with the virtual machine emulation program.

Please provide further information about the problem.
Hopefully, you will be able to amass some information
that can be used to help improve the scripts.
Thanks to what Evert reported about faulty CDROM drives
the find_ir script was improved to be much better with
working with actual quirky CDROM drives.
So retrospect suggests that there is hope for progress.  :)
However, at the moment I do not have a sufficient idea
of what is happening in order to make any changes that
could result in fixing the problems that impaired installation.

If you try qemu then maybe that will work better.

#!/bin/bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 384  \
-cdrom /tmp/sorcerer-x86_64-20100122.iso \
-boot d &quot;$@&quot; -vnc :1 hda &amp;

That command is sufficient to start qemu
in order to test the most recent x86_64 I/R

#!/bin/bash
qemu -m 384 -cdrom /tmp/sorcerer-ia32-20100122.iso \
-boot d &quot;$@&quot; -vnc :1 hda &amp;

And this can be used for testing the IA32 I/R.

# rm hda
# qemu-img create hda 4G

And remember to create the hda image before starting.
And run qemu under a user account and not as root.

If the images do not test out properly
then I do not uploaded them.
