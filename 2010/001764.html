Yeah,
adjusting an init-script
and introducing an error into it
can cause the entire init-script to not run.
I forget how dangerous those are
and why I prefer SAs not to customize them.
However, if the /etc/init.d/mount init-script
is the only init-script that was modified
then the problem is exactly in that init-script.
It might seem really bad, but the problem is not dire.

The easiest fix is to boot from I/R.
That contains a perfectly fine /etc/init.d/mount init-script.
So when the rescue menu displays
select the device that contains the real
root filesystem and mount that.
Then it should boot the box almost as normal.
After that

# cast init-scripts

That will fix it.

Booting into the initramfs is not terrible.
Just log in and then mkdir /media/root
and try mounting the real root filesystem.
If it mounts, then bind virtual filesystems to it
then chroot in, something like:

# mount /dev/sda3 /media/root
# mount --bind /dev /media/root/dev
# mount --bind /proc /media/root/proc
# mount /dev/sda1 /media/root/boot
# chroot /media/root

Once chrooted make fixes
then afterward break the chroot
and umount the filesystems.


&gt;<i> When I log in the directory .sorcery is empty.
</I>
/root/.sorcery/ is normally empty
until the sorcery tools are run.
A tmpfs filesystem is mounted on /root/.sorcery/
That provides extremely fast access to the files
and directories created on /root/.sorcery/

&gt;<i> So I think a reinstall is needed here.
</I>
Yeah, during my first couple of years I bricked my shorts
at any tiny problem and went for a re-install.
But there is more to be learned by trying to fix it.
If the problem occurred due to an edit of /etc/init.d/mount
then that problem can be circumvented by booting using
the I/R and selecting to mount the real root filesystem.
Then,
# cast init-scripts
After that finishes and the loadavg drops down
issue a shutdown command and that will cause
the initramfs to be rebuilt and lilo to be reinstalled
to the boot block or MBR.

With a bit of courage and tenacity the problem can be solved.
Booting happens in these states:
Power on.
BIOS runs.
BIOS loads and runs the master boot record
of the primary fixed disk.
Unless LILO is installed in the MBR
then the MBR usually loads the boot sector
of the first partition on the disk flagged as bootable.
Then LILO, the linux loader runs.
Lilo loads the initramfs and kernel into memory.
Lilo passes execution to the kernel.
The kernel decompresses and unpacks the initramfs
onto the ramfs mounted as / which is also called rootfs.
/init on the rootfs/initramfs is executed by the kernel.
/init executes /etc/init.d/rcS
This begins the sysinit stage.
All the init-scripts in /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/ execute
Eventually, a symbolic link in /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/ is executed
which points to /etc/init.d/mount
This mounts the root filesystem.
But on your box /etc/init.d/mount contains an error
So it probably does not run.
Therefore, when sysinit ends the runlevel execution
begins without being able to switch to the real root filesystem.

Now if you want to fix the error directly.
At the lilo prompt type
the kernel to load followed by
initrd=/bin/bash

Instead of executing /init
a BASH prompt will appear.
Now execute:
# nano /etc/init.d/mount

Fix the bugs introduced into the mount script.
Save the file.
Now at the BASH prompt type:
exec /init

This passes control of process 1 to /init
and booting continues as normal.
If /etc/init.d/mount was successfully fixed
then the box will be able to boot into the real root filesystem.
However, that change will only work for that boot,
unless you log in and then also edit
/etc/init.d/mount again
and make the same changes that fixed
/etc/init.d/mount while on the initramfs.
That permanently fixes the problem.

I like this second method, the direct
hands-on approach fix.
It is fun.

Next time one edits an init-script
and provided that it accepts parameters
such as start and stop
then best to try to run it without parameters.
That way it should print an error message
if a BASH syntax error is introduced
otherwise it will probably print a message about
the parameters the init-script accepts.


&gt;<i> I find it the most wierd that I get a message that I can log in and the same

I realize it seems scary the first time
one breaks a sysinit init-script,
especially one as important as mount
or when glibc ncurses or readline breaks.
But short of a lilo error, or a corrupt initramfs,
or a fixed disk turning to swiss on rye
then most problems are easy to fix.

I apologize for the inconvenience.
It is my fault, because I asked you
to help debug the problem.
I did not at all consider how incredibly dangerous
my request to edit /etc/init.d/mount was.
I was hoping it would be a positive experience
that would help you get your feet wet right
away with the Sorcerer experience and
be able to help out.
Since you spotted the problem I did not
want to deprive you of the opportunity to track
down the bug and squish it.
Asking a new Sorcerer SAs to do something
that derails their box and prevents gets
top plaque on my personal wall of shame.
I never did anything that brainless before.

Still depending upon you the outcome could be good.
I would prefer that nobody develops an init-script phobia.
Confronting and fixing that sort of problem creates confidence.
Re-installing creates the stuff of nightmares.
I am hoping you charge straight at the problem
and fix it by booting.

# rdinit=/bin/bash
# nano /etc/init.d/mount
# exec /init

If the problem was introduced by bugging up the
/etc/init.d/mount init-script
then unbugging it will surely fix the problem.

I normally have this rule to not ask others to do
what I would be unwilling to do for myself.
And I stuck to the rule.
And not even one drop of sweat would roll off my
forehead if I bugged up /etc/init.d/mount on my test box.
But I sure failed to consider how it might ruin your day.
For that I am very sorry.

Wow hindsight is 20/20
and I sure feel like an idiot.
How could I fail to anticipate this.
You can find me sitting in the corner wearing the dunce cap.
