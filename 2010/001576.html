<PRE>Again I want to remind SAs
that what ctrl-c does to sorcery scripts is NOT a bug.
It is an unfortunate consequence of user error.
This example helps explain why using the
all powerful ctrl-c requires willingness
to take responsibility for what happens
or what does not happen.


$ cat /tmp/puppy
#!/bin/bash
trap bad INT
bad(){ echo &quot;Bad puppy!&quot; &gt;&amp;2; }
/bin/sleep 60
echo &quot;Good puppy!&quot;


That is a very easy to understand example script.
If ctrl-c is pressed
then that interrupt is handled by bash
and it transfers control temporarily to
the bad function which prints Bad puppy.

Now here is what happens when we run it:

$ ./puppy
Good puppy!

Hmm, that took a full 60 seconds to run.
I should have put the sleep for only 15, yes?
And here is when we run it and press ctrl-c
shortly after starting it.

$ ./puppy
^CBad puppy!
Good puppy!

As you can see in both cases
the program does reach the last line
which executes and prints &quot;Good puppy!&quot;
However, when we press ctrl-c
the trap in the BASH script can
not prevent the ctrl-c from interrupting
the /bin/sleep 60 command.

This is why pressing ctrl-c while running
sorcery scripts can produce unexpected results.
Since I do not trap it, ctrl-c should abort the sorcery script.
But it might also abort something that is happening
that causes indexing to complete early
yet generate an incomplete index.

I can not attempt to trap ctrl-c and assume
that nothing unexpected will not happen.
Something that should have continued running
definitely aborted and that leads to something
bad happening.

Okay, how about we try:

$ nohup ./puppy
nohup: ignoring input and appending output to `nohup.out'
^C

$ cat /tmp/nohup.out
Bad puppy!
Good puppy!

Oh, look same thing.
Even the very powerful:
&quot;nohup - run a command immune to hangups, with output to a non-tty&quot;
can not block the more powerful ctrl-c

ctrl-c causes a SIGINT, interrupt from keyboard,
and it is difficult if not impossible to trap.

Therefore, the lesson learned from this
is that pressing ctrl-c is like smacking
a puppy upside it's head.
Abused puppies do not behave properly.
So please be gentle to sorcery scripts.
Please do not smack them upside the head with ctrl-c.
And that way sorcery will be a good puppy.  :)

In the future pressing ctrl-c
will not only cause a sorcery script to abort
but it will also print an error message
indicating not to press ctrl-c
and it will remove almost everything
from /root/.sorcery/ except the queues.
This way SAs that insist on pressing ctrl-c
will cause less inconvenience for themselves.
However, pressing ctrl-c is still unsupported.

Please do not try to abort sorcery scripts with ctrl-c
Please do not try to avoid dialog menus by pressing escape.
sorcery is only intended to work properly
when it is is used in a proper fashion.
