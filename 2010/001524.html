<PRE>I've come across a point in the installation that I really don't understand.

I've included the screenshot. Basically, there are three entries in
setting up /etc/fstab (disregard /dev/hda2 in this case, as I was creating
a large swap partition, and I see now that it is desired to create a
swapfile instead on /dev/hda1.

So the entries are

1.) Device

2.) /dev/hda1 (No problem understanding this.

3.) /swap (I understand now that this is a swap file, no partition required)

What is #1, Device????? Should I mount a &quot;/&quot; on it? when I enter the
submenu, it appears that I need to fill something out but if I select
&quot;Device&quot; from that sub-menu, nothing happens, except that something
whizzes by and I can't read it.

Perhaps this is &quot;/&quot; on the CDROM? And I don't need to fill out anything?
I've even tried deleting that entry.

All files seem to copy over from the CDROM onto /dev/hda1 (&quot;/&quot;), but still
no reboot when everything is complete. I also discovered not to install
the final packages for ISDN/WLAN/dialup/etc., networking, as it kicks me
into a blank file in pico. If I just skip those files and let the
compile/lilo/MBR get written all looks good, except still, no boot after
reboot.

I noticed from Evert's email that he says to umount at the very end, which
I haven't put in the steps yet. Although a pretty detailed install manual
is developing out of this experience LOL!

We don't need a /boot partition do we? This version of lilo and the kernel
shouldn't have a problem with big HDDs.

Once I figure out what I'm doing wrong, I'm going to experiment with
deleting the swapfile entry in /etc/fstab during install and just create a
swap partition. I think that's a better way to go, although I know that
nowadays many people are just desiring to have swapfiles in their /
partition.

hm...

Your thoughts? Comments?

Kindest regards,

Bradley.


&gt;<i> If you work VERY quickly, you can snap a pic of the screen as it's
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to be. I've included a screenshot of the screen as it is when
</I>&gt;<i> you wait for than one or two seconds, and receive the console output
</I>&gt;<i> which will confuse someone who hasn't been through the install process
</I>&gt;<i> before.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've also included a shot of the rpcbind errors that are received once
</I>&gt;<i> the user selects the keyboard mapping for their locale. This shows the
</I>&gt;<i> errors, early on I believe, that were being experienced with nfsd and
</I>&gt;<i> subsequently corrected by commenting out the /etc/rc.* entries discussed
</I>&gt;<i> the earlier emails by Evert and Jan.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm currently in the process of building a detailed installation manual,
</I>&gt;<i> and I could use some help critiquing it, of course, I'm going to do my
</I>&gt;<i> best NOT to show the errors that are currently showing up in the process
</I>&gt;<i> of my own installs :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, by the time I'm finished those issues will be resolved ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A detailed, installation manual with images will go a long way towards
</I>&gt;<i> increasing usership of this wonderful distro :)
