&gt;<i> Greetings! &#160;I saw a screenshot of Sorcerer on deviantart and had to try it.

I had no idea anyone was advertising.
Sorcerer tends to be a trial by invitation type thing.

&gt;<i>&#160;I got it installed no problem. &#160;My problem is with a dialup connection to the internet. &#160;Wvdial would not compile.
</I>
Although it passed most recent tests
the software itself is ancient.
Not much interest in dial up,
however Sorcerer would not be a bad choice
to use on dial up due to the ability to download
sdelta3 patches for software updates.


&gt;<i>&#160;I brought in pppsetup--which is the fine dialup setup program used in Slackware and by me for 5 years.
</I>
Have not tried it.
I used to write my own chat script for connecting
with an ISP and starting a PPP connection.
It is not difficult to do.


&gt;<i> The messages at var/log/messages indicate that a connection gets established, internet addresses get assigned dynamically, and all appears to be fine.
</I>
That is good.
Did you try using the lynx web browser,
lftp, or curl to download files?
Is DNS okay, can names be resolved to IP addresses?


&gt;<i>&#160;When I run augur sync or cast a spell the modem begins to redial and continues to do so until I kill the process.
</I>
augur and cast have no ability to dial.
However, if a PPP on demand program is set up
then perhaps the disconnecting and dialing is also upon demand?
Depending upon how it is configured I suppose that
the dialing and disconnecting could be very frequent.
Although I have heard of on-demand PPP
I have never tried it.
So I know nothing about it.
I would just use a simple chat script,
establish a connection and keep it until
either the ISP hung up on me or I hung up on them.


&gt;<i>&#160;This puzzles me since pppsetup usually has no problems
</I>&gt;<i> whatsoever. &#160;I've also brought in chatscripts from linux mint to
</I>&gt;<i> generate a &quot;pppd call provider&quot; means of accessing the web.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;Pap authentication and ip address assignment again no
</I>&gt;<i> problem. &#160;Try doing anything and the modem begins to redial.
</I>&gt;<i>&#160;I've added the ppp -c and ppp -d commands to the network
</I>&gt;<i> configuration so ppp0 can be started through the network start
</I>&gt;<i>command.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;Nothing effects the persistent modem redialing. &#160;I'm perplexed. Any ideas would be helpful. Thanks.

At the moment I have no guess about it.
However, I can tell you that the sorcery tools
do all the their web/ftp access using curl.
Even if some information must be post
to a CGI script on a website
then the sorcery tools do so using curl.
So what I would want to to test first
would be to establish a connection
and then trying to download some files
using curl from the command line.

The sorcery tools have no method for
automatically detecting a network connection
nor creating a network connection nor dialing an ISP.

What I do remember is that
ppp installs
/bin/pon
/bin/poff

One might start by looking at that file
and then by deciding if the chat script
is called isp and where in /etc/ppp/
that should be located.
Oh, probably /etc/ppp/chat

A chat script should look something like:

# cat /etc/ppp/chat/isp
ABORT 'BUSY'
ABORT 'NO CARRIER'
ABORT 'VOICE'
ABORT 'NO DIALTONE'
ABORT 'NO DIAL TONE'
ABORT 'NO ANSWER'
'' AT&amp;N16&amp;U12
SAY  &quot;\n  Dialing ISP.\n&quot;
OK-AT-OK ATDT5291937
TIMEOUT 120
SAY  &quot;\n  Waiting up to 2 minutes for connection.\n&quot;
CONNECT ''
SAY  &quot;\n  Connection established.\n&quot;
ogin: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sorcerer-admins">roland at somwhere.net</A>
ssword: \qbluemoon
SAY  &quot;\n  Transmitted username and password.\n&quot;
'' \d\c

/etc/ppers/isp
would contain something like:

# cat isp
noauth
/dev/modem
115200
defaultroute
usepeerdns
connect &quot;chat -v -e -f /etc/ppp/chat/isp&quot;

/etc/ppp/options
should be something like:

# cat options
# mru 1280
# mtu 1280
mru 768
mtu 768
nobsdcomp
deflate 15,15
persist
vj-max-slots 16

And if PAP is used then
a pap secret should be specified in
/etc/pap-secrets
see manual page for what that should be like.

I do not remember much else about PPP.
While it is not lengthy to set up
it can be a bit tricky to set up and test.

Previously, I was of the opinion that
writing the files myself was easier than
using a PPP configuration program.
But go ahead and try whatever seems easy
and then probably take a look at the above
mentioned files to see if they are as expected.

There is probably a PPP HowTo
at the Linux Documentation Project.
There is definitely

# augur install ppp | grep man
/usr/share/man
/usr/share/man/man8
/usr/share/man/man8/chat.8
/usr/share/man/man8/pppd-radattr.8
/usr/share/man/man8/pppd-radius.8
/usr/share/man/man8/pppd.8
/usr/share/man/man8/pppdump.8
/usr/share/man/man8/pppstats.8

some ppp related manual pages.
And if all else fails there is the ppp
source tarball that might contain
some additional documentation.

# augur category network/ppp
diald
ppp
slmodem
wvdial

Not much in the network/ppp category of software.
More is welcome if anyone wants to write spells
for the software that they use.
diald well is a dial on demand type program.
I have no idea how it is supposed to work.
It might cause problems or solve problems.

If I am really stumped I like to look at
files that might prove insightful stored in
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/
Maybe none of it is useful?

# zcat /proc/config.gz | grep -i ppp
CONFIG_HDLC_PPP=m
CONFIG_PPP=m
CONFIG_PPP_MULTILINK=y
CONFIG_PPP_FILTER=y
CONFIG_PPP_ASYNC=m
CONFIG_PPP_SYNC_TTY=m
CONFIG_PPP_DEFLATE=m
CONFIG_PPP_BSDCOMP=m
CONFIG_PPP_MPPE=m
CONFIG_PPPOE=m
CONFIG_PPPOATM=m
CONFIG_PPPOL2TP=m
CONFIG_ISDN_PPP=y
CONFIG_ISDN_PPP_VJ=y
CONFIG_IPPP_FILTER=y
CONFIG_ISDN_PPP_BSDCOMP=m

Kernel options at compile time that relate to PPP.
Does the kernel have what is expected?
Are required modules loading automatically?

I have a box with a modem in it.
But I do not have a PPP account to test with.
I suspect Sorcerer still works fine with dial up PPP,
but it is something that requires testing.
Good luck.
