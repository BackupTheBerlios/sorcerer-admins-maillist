<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Thanks for offering the useful advice, Bradley D. Thornton.
However, if I may digress even further...
Years ago Bob Finch wanted for Sorcerer to be a better
compromise between source and and pre-compiled binary.
Although the idea of a Sorcerer Live CD has been discussed
nobody allocated the effort to create it.
And there is good reason for that,
even though the making of a Sorcerer Live CD is not impossible.
There was a time when I nearly did it.

Years ago the Install/Rescue image contained a very nice
full populated base installation on a ziso9660 filesystem.
That is where individual files on the CD
can be gzip compressed and yet when read
will be transparently decompressed.
However, even with the ziso9660 image
the 650M CD limit could easily be exceeded.

More to the point is also that Sorcerer
is an implementation of POSIX
where the advantages of Sorcerer
only becomes evident after
it has been installed and updated.
The eloquence of Sorcerer
is not in creating a single nearly fully runnable
implementation of an operating system on CD.
Rather it is to create a CD
that can be installed on a box
and then have the box updated monthly
without ever having to do a fresh installation of the distro
as is traditional with pre-compiled binary based distros.

Of course Sorcerer SAs already know this,
because we have been doing it for a decade.
Yet I wanted to state it again explicitly because
it creates the a necessary contrast that makes
possible the realization that
Sorcerer is perhaps very nearly the opposite of
what is ideal and desired in a live CD distro.

Essentially, a live CD is like an installed distribution
that is frozen in time.
Rather than be frozen and
do releases like pre-compiled binary based distros do
Sorcerer is a distribution with the design
which attempts to be fluid and evolving.
Consequently, there was never a Sorcerer 1.0 release,
nor will there ever be a Sorcerer 2.0 release.
Instead the Install/Rescue CDs
merely have a date in their filename
which indicates when they were created.
Obviously, this is a method for SAs to
immediately know how old a Sorcerer I/R is.

I feel as if I should re-emphasize that
the use of a date rather than a version
for Sorcerer I/Rs provides more useful
information to SAs.
It nearly begs the question why this practice
of using a date instead of an arbitrary version number
is almost exclusive to Sorcerer.
Since the design for Sorcerer
was not a copy, fork,
clone, nor rewrite of any other distro;
weird, useful and perhaps even unique practices
might be almost nearly the norm for Sorcerer.
However, I want to regress to the contrast
between source and pre-compiled binary based distros.

Precompiled binary based distros make releases that
attempt to emulate a perfectly clear and focused picture
as if nothing in the picture is moving nor changing.
However, the Sorcerer Install/Rescue CD is like a photo
taken from a fast moving train.
Yes one can see the picture, but it can look slightly blurred.
That is because Sorcerer
is always in the process of moving forward.

Recently, I was talking to someone who told me
that there was a word for this.
He said the word was &quot;rolling-release.&quot;
As far as I know when Sorcerer was started
there were no distributions that did &quot;rolling-release.&quot;
Yet Sorcerer never did anything any type of release
except a rolling-release.

During the first and second year mostly
people were nay-sayers.
They insisted that a source based distribution
would be not merely a headache to maintain,
but also impossible to fit all the software together.
In retrospect they were wrong, mostly.

Sorcerer boxes do manage to fit the pieces together
even after library updates like glibc, ncurses, and readline.
All of that wonderful mending and hemming of the seams
is automatic in Sorcerer and happens on each box.
And it is wonderful because it also allows each box
to have a very individual loadout of software.

Yes Sorcerer is a headache at times.
But the really big pain is just during the first install.
Unlike a pre-compiled binary based distro that
can bring a slew of several problems at once
each time it is re-installed;
Sorcerer's big hurt is a one time shot in the arm.

Problems do happen during updates, sometimes.
The largest percent of those problems are detected,
fixed, and avoided at the testing level.
However, due to the unique loadout of software
on each Sorcerer box, sometimes problems occur
that are specific to some boxes.
And while this is an inconvenience to Sorcerer SAs,
the pain is often a minor one that is easily solved
relative to the SA's skill.
And when bugs are reported
then a fix can usually go into the grimoire within a day or two.
Therefore, update problems are
usually it is no worse than a bad hair day.

Recently, there was a seriously bad hair day.
KDE version 4.4.0 release brought about the discussion
which implied the question should we have
just skipped 4.4.0 and started with 4.4.1 instead.
The crashing screen locking problem was a
serious security risk.
And the the bug that could cause all konsoles to
crash when one was closing was also an inconvenient bug.
Fortunately, that headache is already ancient history,
since we now have KDE 4.4.1.

Chances are that a pre-compiled binary based distro
that does release cycles that tend to provide software
that is a year older than is available might be able to
avoid the KDE 4.4.0 problem since it's faults would
have been long documented.
However, the heads of such a coin also has a tails side.
With older software the possibility exists that some people
would know exploits and be able to gain unauthorized access.
In general the older installed software becomes
the greater the potential for it becoming a security weakness.
Consequently, ideal security can not be achieved in neither
distributions that provide stable software
nor in distributions that provide obsolete version of software.

Security risk also applies to distributions that backport
security patches to older versions of the software.
I do admire those who backport patches because
it requires significant skill and knowledge create.
With consideration it would seem capable of
providing better stability and security
as compared to using currently available stable software.
Yet like most things there is no guarantee.
Obviously there is no ideal solution to the problem
of creating optimal security with installed software.

Given Sorcerer's style of providing software that
software authors have declared stable
and the fluid seamless updating of boxes;
Sorcerer represents not merely the anti-thesis
of pre-compiled binary based distros,
but is also very far away what would be ideal
for making a live CD distribution.

I apologize for digression a bit further than expected.
However, to return to discussing what Bob wanted....
Bob wanted something that is not unlike what
zero-install-injector is today.
He wanted the power of sorcery
yet to have the convenience of an already stocked
cache of archive files that could be shared distribution
wide across the Internet as if they were
pre-compiled binary packages.

Unfortunately, there is more than a dozen reasons
why that would not work good on Sorcerer.
Also more than a dozen more reasons exists
why a making Sorcerer hybrid would be undesirable.
For example since each Sorcerer box can be unique
there is no telling what version of glibc is installed.
Software that is compiled and linked against glibc
version 2.11.1 will definitely not run on a box that has
glibc version 2.7 installed.
So even if pre-compiled software,
similar to packages, is available
the installation of those archives would
probably provide software that is missing
required ELF libraries.
Therefore, the archive would be download,
installed, and provide totally useless software
since the source would have to be downloaded
and compiled in order to create software that
is properly linked with the ELF libraries that are
available on the deployed box.

Ouch.
Sorry for the long and boring discussion.
It is completely obvious to experienced Sorcerer SAs.
However, new SAs migrating to Sorcerer
from pre-compiled binary based distros
can be blissfully unaware of the complicated weave
of executables and the ELF libraries that they require.

The Sorcerer approach is to detect missing ELF libraries
and heal installed software by recompiling
installed software when necessary.
That is a good method.
Probably Sorcerer was the first distribution
to have a method that operated
entirely upon each deployed Sorcerer box.
The strength of this method grants Sorcerer SAs
the freedom to install practically any software desired
and also any version of any library.
That is within some reasonable limits of course.
But the point is that Sorcerer boxes automatically
look for the problems and fix it usually without
complaint nor intervention of the SA.

However, this method for handling the complicated
dependency between ELF executables and ELF libraries
is vastly different than what binary based distros do.
And for that reason no attempt at making Sorcerer
operate like a binary based distro
could achieve the wonderful results expected
of a binary based distribution.
It would be like using hammer to drive in a screw.
The end result would be messy and unsatisfactory.

I will never claim that there is any one best distribution.
Each distribution is like a different tool.
Hammers are good for driving nails.
Screw drivers are good for driving screws.
And Sorcerer is good for driving source.
Sorcerer is good at what Sorcerer does,
as long as it stays true to it's design.
Yet no amount of small changes can satisfactorily
grant it the speed of installation that is commensurate
with a binary based distro.

Some people like milk.
Some people like orange juice.
Some people like apple juice.
Individually they are okay if that is what one likes.
Yet mixing them together creates beverage
that anyone would cringe at the thought of drinking.

I tried to find a compromise between simply stating
that Sorcerer is a bad choice for a Live CD distro
and also trying to explain the reasons for that opinion.
Although it might be difficult to believe,
there is much potential for elaboration
that I dismissed as difficult to understand techno-babble.
Therefore, I would be happy merely to have successfully
conveyed the idea that Sorcerer should compete in
it's areas of strength rather than it's areas of weakness.
A Sorcerer Live CD would be fun and potentially useful.
But it would never be half the quality compared
to what a distribution could be
that is designed for creating Live CDs.

Sorry for being verbose about it.
However, there is value in understanding
Sorcerer's design goal and being able to decide
if Sorcerer can become the tool that a SA
would favor for the task at hand.

That said I might seem to be guarding against
the potential for Sorcerer mutating into a nasty
useless beast of a tool.
And from time to time I do exactly that
and shoot down ideas that diminish,
compromise or inhibit Sorcerer's strong points.
However, I also welcome and graciously
thank SAs that report bugs and make
recommendations for improvement.

Sorcerer might be good at what it does.
However, I do not want to audaciously imply
that Sorcerer is superior or beyond improvement.
If everyone chips in a little bit of effort to
report bugs, surmise the cause, provide fixes
then the Sorcerer boat will float great.
Together we can make Sorcerer, sorcery, and the grimoire
fine tools for navigating the sea of open source
and free software.
