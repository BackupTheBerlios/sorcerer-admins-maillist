&gt;<i> Where I differ from Sorcerer, and where I had most of my dificulties,
</I>&gt;<i> was in creating a swap partition instead of the swap file in the
</I>&gt;<i> standard installation. I could be wrong, and might be creating extra
</I>&gt;<i> work for myself, but I like the idea of SWAP memory on its own actual
</I>&gt;<i> partition (Kyle, what are your thoughts on this?).
</I>
Swap partitions are entirely superior to swap files,
but they are less flexible.
Multiple swap partitions on separate devices
do not appear to stripe as suggested
even when they have the same priority.
Swap partitions are faster to access than swap files
and do not fragment a filesystem.
However, a swap area whether file or partition
itself can become fragmented.

The complimentary swap file that is created when
Sorcerer is installed is too small to be of any use
other than for installing.
However, because it is dd to capacity on an empty
filesystem the file/space created for the swap file
is allocated without fragmentation.
And that is good.
The main reason to have swap files is to
make better use of disk space and have flexibility.
However, I still recommend something like a
1G or 2G dedicated swap partition
and then to add swap files later if memory demands
can not be satisfied.

Lastly, too much swap can waste RAM with overhead.
However, a normally running box should have enough
swap to be able to swap.
Many programs that run constantly have portions
of memory that are not frequently accessed.
Those portions can eventually be swapped to disk
and therefore grant an increase in available RAM.
Therefore, even on boxes that have 8G or more of RAM
having a bit of swap space can improve performance.

&gt;<i> This I typically put this on /dev/hda2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of the SWAP issue/prefs, perhaps Roelof could benefit from a
</I>&gt;<i> /boot on the primary, bootable partition of /dev/hda1 - I glean that
</I>&gt;<i> there is no support for booting / as XFS from the Sorcerer I/R ???
</I>
I did not understand your question.
Also I do not understand how he managed
the first boot after completing installation.
I would have expected that his root partition
would have immediately been damaged by lilo.
But I have no experience with this

I am not against creating boxes without a /boot partition.
But having /boot seems to avoid potential problems
like the lilo installed to a non-existent boot block
on an XFS partition.
Likewise I am not against using grub,
but I have only written support for lilo
and tend to prefer lilo for Sorcerer.
I re-evaluate that decision every year or two.
grub can load multiple initramfs per kernel
which is something lilo can not do.
Each has different boons and banes.


&gt;<i> Dunno if something like Knoppix supports that, as I have a custom
</I>&gt;<i> Slackware CD I spun to support such a mount wrt XFS.
</I>
Sorcerer installer or even more so the I/R while logged
into the initramfs can do nearly any type of
filesystem type installation that a SA might want.
However, not every combination makes sense.

I do not care what type of installation Sorcerer SAs
want to try as long as they can make it work.
They can set up a huge MDRAID spanning several devices
and then slice it like a pizza using LVM2.
If that works then that could be useful.

I tried to make the installer helpful for
accomplishing what the SA wants to do.
As some people pointed out,
it is sort of like a car without breaks.  :)
It can get a SA to destination at a reasonable speed,
but there almost nothing to stop a SA from
driving it off the road and flipping it over a few times.  :)

I normally test a simple 2 or 3 partition set up
that I know will work instead of going for something
entirely different and not knowing if the bug or problem
I experienced was due to a choice I made or
bad code I introduced into the menu driven installer.

I have no clue about
what the best file system is.
I only have an opinion about swap
because I have been using it for a while.
Likewise I tend to stick with ext2 and ext3
because I have been using it for a while.

I deploy old file systems and stable software.
I am not an adventurous SA.
Sorcerer as an operating system is usually rather stable
often for many months to nearly years at a time.
The DESTDIR transition is one of
the few exciting moments when the
bug reports are popping faster
than corn in the microwave.
Usually the list is quiet.
