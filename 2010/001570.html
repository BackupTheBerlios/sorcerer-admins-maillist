<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>According to <A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/">http://www.kernel.org/</A>
there are plenty of stable releases of linux to choose from.
Let us say that the versions of kernels are represented by the variables w.x.y.z
w is always 2
x  should be 6
y represents a branch where certain technology and new drivers are introduced
z indicates bug fixes and security patches.

So what does it mean?
Well through retrospect I gather it means something like this...
One of my workstations has a network device
that can only be driven by linux 2.6.30.? kernels.
When booting linux 2.6.31 and higher kernels
I immediately noticed that I was unable to create a network connection.
Yet when booting 2.6.30.? kernels making a network connection
was possible without making any additional change.

So if the stable versions of linux look like:

stable:  	2.6.33.2
stable: 	2.6.32.11
stable: 	2.6.31.13
stable: 	2.6.30.10

then which is the best version to use?
If one has extremely new hardware in their box
and/or linux version 2.6.33.2 correctly drives the hardware
then the version with the highest y value tends to be a good choice.
Do I know what version you should use on your box?
No, I have no clue.
So instead I am trying to make the linux spell choices
better represent what is offered according to <A HREF="http://www.kernel.org">http://www.kernel.org</A>

Here are the new spells:

linux
linux-2.6.27
linux-2.6.30
linux-2.6.31
linux-2.6.32
linux-custom

linux-custom is what the old linux spell used to be.
The SA must provide a .config file to use.
Also the version on linux-custom must be set by the SA
using the # augur version linux-custom $VERSION
If the SA is using custom configured kernels
then the SA is responsible for updating the version number
for that spell and updating it's configuration file as necessary.
Fortunately, most Sorcerer SAs will not be using linux-custom
So we can immediately forget about the linux-custom spell.

linux
linux-2.6.27
linux-2.6.30
linux-2.6.31
linux-2.6.32

Those spells all come with configuration files for IA32, IA32-SMP, and x86_64
The SA need only decide upon which spell to cast.
Deployed boxes will automatically switch over from
having linux-modular installed to having linux installed
linux will install the most current highest y value branch of linux available.
I hope that linux will be a good choice for many boxes.

However, for my workstation where the network device only works
when driven by the 2.6.30.x kernels;
on that box I will cast linux-2.6.30
which will install linux version 2.6.30.13

Are you confused yet?
Well the topic is a bit confusing.
We owe it to the linux developers who
want to charge ahead with progress
without doing much testing to see what breaks.

I am not complaining.
The situation would be worse.
If the only stable branch of linux
that can drives my old cheap network device becomes obsolete
then I must buy a new network device to replace my paperweight.

In the past linux used to be an excellent kernel
for driving both new and old hardware.
Hardware that became without drivers
in modern commercial operating systems
would still work like new with a modern linux kernel.
However, modern linux kernel development
seems to be pressured to grow.
Therefore, our favorite pieces of legacy hardware
will probably soon take up residence at the landfill.
But if a device worked fine on a somewhat older stable branch of linux
then there is still hope that one can continue riding that branch for as long
as it is maintained.

These new linux spells in the grimoire will
change, update, and disappear roughly according
to what appears to be stable on <A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/">http://www.kernel.org/</A>

Will I be checking each update of linux and linux-2.6.*
to see if it compiles, installs, and runs?
No, actually, I am just going to update the versions
and assume that everything goes according to plan.
Since new features and new drivers are not added
when the kernel updates only the z value
the kernel configurations that I created
when I created the spell should be able to carry forward.

If you notice a serious problem with a linux or linux-2.6.* spell
then please report it.
Otherwise if it is not a bug in the spell
then the kernels will probably work as good
as the linux kernel hackers could manage.

Please do not blame me if your hardware does not work.
Also please do not ask me if Sorcerer supports &quot;such and such&quot; hardware.
Questions about the linux kernel should be directed
at different email lists.
I am not a linux kernel hacker.
I can answer questions about the linux kernel
at the knowledge level of a regular SA.
To put it simply I am not the best person to ask.

My goal is to create the spells that will give SAs
as much convenience as possible
while still providing as much selection as a SA
would have if manually downloading, configuring,
compiling, and installing a linux kernel.

Lastly, the question... why so many linux-2.6.* spells
instead of a single spell with different version progresses.
The answer is because linux is a bit different than other projects.
The version progress currently supports selections of:
a custom version;
stable version;
unstable version;
legacy version;
secure version.
That selection works fine for many software projects.
But with linux there is an arbitrary amount of stable versions.

Can I do an augur progress linux $VERSION
and set an arbitrary version for that spell?
I advise against that.
The linux and linux-2.6.* spells have configuration files
that are only good for the series of versions specified
in the stable version sequence for those spells.

So if the current version of linux is 2.6.33.2
and the SA does:
# augur progress linux 2.6.34.1
Because the SA is impatient to wait for me to update those spells
then linux will compile without a .config file and create
a kernel and modules that are unusable and unbootable.

I might change the spells in the future so that setting version
progress on linux works.
But for now if a SA wants a custom linux version and custom config
then use the linux-custom spell instead.

Again I apologize for the complexity.
I am still providing as much convenience as possible
while matching the selection of kernels avaialble
if one were to do a manual install after choosing
a recommended kernel from <A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/">http://www.kernel.org/</A>
