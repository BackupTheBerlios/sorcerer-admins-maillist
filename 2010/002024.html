<PRE>I used to own the channel a long time ago.
Who knows now.
I forgot how IRC works  :)
Having someone who is a fair and knowledgeable representative of Sorcerer
on the IRC channel would be nice, but
as we all know in most IRC channels with hundreds of people logged in
none of them are awake and listening.
*lol*
With Sorcerer's IRC channel the truth is more obvious
since nobody is logged in.

Unfortunately, not 100% is working, then again it never is.
That is not so bad because problems are often caused by
software authors, libtool, and other non Sorcerer/sorcery related factors.
The goal is 95% usability.
Usually we meet that.
If not then it is because the are some &quot;forever broke&quot; spells
in the grimoire which I have not removed.
By &quot;forever broke&quot; it means that it is broke
and the software author has discontinued making releases for it.
Some things surprise me.
I was expecting that aviation was forever broke at version 0.1,
but then the software author made a 0.2 release.
It compiles and installs, but is still unusable.
*lol*  Maybe that qualifies version 0.2 as broke also.

The fixing broke spells has a low priority.
Next attempts are usually made when time is available
or when the software author makes new releases.
Removing broke spells tends to happen after the software's website becomes
unreachable or owned by a DNS squatter.
Feel free to try to fix the changes and submit the fixes into the grimoire
for spells that have the broke attribute.

As for the quiet...
Many people are doing the year end rush
to try to complete tasks which either should not
or can not linger into 2011.
The end of the year can be stressful.

For those with a few minutes to play
there are some December Install/Rescue images
that I uploaded near the beginning of the month.
They passed testing.
So they will probably work.
