<PRE>There is a rumor that an ISO9660 image can be
dd onto a USB memory stick for a one time permanent transfer
that becomes bootable and irreversible.
I have not tried it.
isolinux would not be able to boot of a USB stick,
however lilo has no problem with it if the image on the
USB stick is ext2 or ext3.

Unfortunately, using lilo for the boot program would
probably make it so that USB memory stick might only
be bootable on a box with the same fixed disk configuration.
Probably grub would work for booting it since grub can
read ext2 filesystems and the SA would be able to select
a kernel and initramfs image to load.

If the filesystem on the USB stick is FAT32,
which would be acceptable
for storing a kernel, initramfs, and tar.xz archives,
then syslinux would be able to load the kernel and
initramfs image.
This I have not tested.
However, syslinux contains loaders for loading linux
off of FAT32, ext2 and 3, and ISO9660.
And inside the tarball is even some legacy documentation
that describes how to set up linux for loading from a zip disk.

Another solution for booting is to use a network enabled
boot floppy image loader.
There is a project for that being hosted somewhere one
www.kernel.org
Basically, from the floppy is loaded a bootloader that is
capable of downloading the kernel from the Internet and
also an initramfs image.
If using a distribution already configured for use with this
then the entire root filesystem can be mounted read/only
as a thin client by using a fuse filesystem what downloads
data as necessary over HTTP or HTTPs by using byte
range requests.
Basically, it is httpfs.  :)

Someone clever with a bit of time to allocate to the task
can also make thin clients out of Sorcerer if they wanted.
But it seems less than practical these days with the
affordability of fixed disks and the large strain thin clients
can place upon a network.

Probably, I would not bother to create a Sorcerer I/R
that is bootable from USB.
Instead I would install Sorcerer to a USB memory stick.
In that fashion it would be bootable
and contain a complete base installation that can easily be
copied onto the fixed disk of another box.
Installing from something like that is basically,
fdisk it,
make a filesytem, cp -ax everything into the new filesystem,
mount --bind some virtual filesystems,
chroot in and adjust fstab and lilo,
break the chroot,
reboot,
disconnect the USB memory stick and boot using
the fixed disk installation of Sorcerer.

If there is an ideal method for making a USB stick I/R
then please someone do tell, because I do not know.
Trying the dd from iso9660 image onto the USB memory stick
seems like a good first try.
Sure, the USB memory stick might be ruined.
But it also might create an image that isolinux can boot.
In that case it would work even better than a CD since
it would be free of burn errors and access files much
faster than a CDROM drive can.
Since the Sorcerer I/R is less than 512M
a 512M USB memory stick would be the cheapest
ideal choice to demolish using dd.
In the future I might start doing that merely because
burned CDs can be faulty or sometimes read faulty
in some drives where in other drives they read fine.
