<PRE>Currently, Sorcerer provides a selection of 3 programs
that can be used to partition a fixed disk.
I only use fdisk.
The other two programs do not work in exactly the same way,
and can probably create partitions that do not begin and
end necessarily on a cylinder head.
Generally, I prefer the clean partitions that fdisk makes,
and also the simple to use commands.
However, if I am remembering correctly,
cfdisk provides a somewhat menu driven style method
for creating partitions on a fixed disk.
Is that better, safer, easier?
I do not know.

I am thinking that when the partition menu is selected
that perhaps it should first display a help screen that
explains how to create a partition using disk on an empty disk.
Perhaps that will encourage the SA to select fdisk
as the partition program and be able to successfully create
a partition.

I suppose the reason this question has not occurred before
is the expectation that a Sorcerer SA will have had previous
experience with partitioning a disk.
Knowing what a disk partitioning is
and how to accomplish partitioning
is expected knowledge for a SA.

But I suppose in order to make the menu driven installer
a success for all SAs
then it must be designed with the assumption
that the SA has 0 experience and 0 knowledge.

Seems like I have at least 40 hours to put in
on re-hacking the menu driven installer and introduce
new help screens and tutorials.
But at least I have some vague idea of what it aught to be like.

In the past I have been most concerned
with the menu driven installer being bug free
and doing exactly what the menus should do.
Yet I gave no concern to SAs' skill and knowledge.
Probably, for that reason more than any other
the menu driven installer is
not successful for everyone.

Thanks for the feedback Nathan Allen.
Hopefully, we can eventually create a
menu driven installer that generates a successful
experience for almost anyone.
That way they will only be stumped when
the time comes to configure networking.  :)
