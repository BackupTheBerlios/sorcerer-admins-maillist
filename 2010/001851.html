Good idea.
Unfortunately, it is not so easy to accomplish.
There is more than one way that a message can travel
and eventually display on the console.
Imagine a park with 4 different entrances.
There is /dev/consle, kernel logger, system log,
and output from a program that might be redirected
to a TTY/virtual console.

The kernel log is a ring buffer.
If it is too small new data can overwrite old data.
It is output using the dmesg command.
Not everything that appears in the kernel log
will necessarily be displayed on console.
That is controlled by loglevel.
I do not know if the kernel log can be displayed
without dmesg or piped into another file or
if I can pipe text into the kernel log.
Some of the scroll that does not enter into
/etc/init.d/log.d/{sysinit,runlevel.$RL} will
go into /etc/init.d/log.d/dmesg

The system log might be even less
buffered than the kernel ring buffer.
If a system logging program is not running
then messages send to the system log are usually lost.
System logging is usually done to files in /var/log/
therefore the system logger starts late during boot.
It probably starts during runlevels instead of sysinit.

/dev/console might have a read/write mode.
But can it be read and piped into a file?
If so then what would show up?
I have only written to /dev/console and that works.
No luck with reading it nor knowing what to expect.
Stuff that outputs on stdout or stderr from init-scripts
I can easily redirect to a file and a virtual console
or perhaps almost any suitable character device.
However, integrating the other 3 types of output
with the output of init-scripts into a single file
is not something I already know how to accomplish.
Is anyone doing that?

Probably I could syslog some messages from init-scripts.
However, that would not include the immediate stdout
and stderr from services started.
I do not have log_{warning,success,failure}_msg calls
syslogged in init-scripts for two reasons.
First, syslog starts late.
Second, each line requires the overhead of
running a process such as logger.

Making it all play nice together in a single room
probably requires considerable effort to accomplish.
Yet surprisingly if sysinit and runlevel output
is not redirected to a virtual console,
but instead allowed to display on the console
and booting was with console redirected to
serial TTY, and the someone was connected
to the booting computer though a serial port
and using a communications program
then that person could log everything displayed
using their communications program.  :)
Almost everything would be displayed
expect warning and less trivial messages
that are insufficient to meet the console loglevel.
Those would go straight into the kernel log.

Although I do not do this with Sorcerer's kernel
output to each virtual console can be back buffered in RAM.
That way even if one switched virtual consoles and back
then one would be able to scroll up on the previously
activated virtual console.
It has a permanent cost in RAM.
How much RAM I do not remember.
How much scroll is saved I do not remember.

I do not know if that is even useful to the discussion.
