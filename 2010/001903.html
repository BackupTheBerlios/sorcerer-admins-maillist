<PRE>It is not so scary.

<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org">http://www.tldp.org</A>

Just doing something like re-configuring Linux-PAM
could be a scary daunting chore if we did not have
HowTos to help explain it.
And there is probably also might documentation,
manual pages, and info pages to read as installed
by most software projects on a Sorcerer box.

Likewise there is interesting documentation in directories such as:

/usr/src/linux/Documentation
/usr/doc
/usr/share/doc

Sorcerer, like most any distro, is comprised of software
from many different projects and people.
And their software is constantly updating.
Therefore, the only way to gain the know about
the current situation of programs such as bind, udev, php, C
is to visit the software authors home pages and
read the documentation provided there.
That is why spells usually contain a homepage.

# augur homepage gcc-core
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org">http://gcc.gnu.org</A>

Eventually, from clicking hyperlinks from there
one should be able to arrive at documentation
that is accurate for the version of gcc they want to use.
gcc's C and C++ compiler changes syntax when it updates.
Often this causes problems and sources that used to compile
no longer compile because they contain deprecated syntax
that is no longer supported or that gcc refuses to understand
even when older versions of gcc could compile it.

The guidelines for how the distribution should keep software
glued together is something different.

<A HREF="http://refspecs.linux-foundation.org/LSB_4.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/book1.html">http://refspecs.linux-foundation.org/LSB_4.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/book1.html</A>

That should provide a good read and help someone
gain familiarity about what to expect.
Please keep in mind that the parts that pertain only
to pre-compiled binary based distros do not pertain to Sorcerer.
There are NO packages and NO package manager in Sorcerer.

The way software is loaded onto boxes
and the choice of directories is not entirely random,
however is often too random for my liking.  :)

<A HREF="http://tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/">http://tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/</A>

This is what is followed for Sorcerer.
It is also why I become pissy at spell writers
that allow their spell installed software to
go into /usr/local/

The /lib/ /lib64/ thing on x86_64 is entirely up
to software authors to follow or not to follow.
There is no attempt to force the issue by spell authors.

Of course there are a few things installed by Sorcerer
that are Sorcerer specific.
And usually documentation for it appears very close
to where one would expect to look.

/etc/networks.d/templates/README
/etc/init.d/README

# augur help
# augur help progress

The last part two lines demonstrate the augur help system.
There is both a generic one line per command help screen.
However, asking for help on a specific augur command
can sometimes provide pages more of additional information.

Most of Sorcerer's documentation is
where the SA would expect to find it.
The docs for augur are part of the program.
Makes it easier to keep current.
No searching the WWW to find it.
However, the docs for software that
is maintained outside of Sorcerer
is found usually at or or near the respective
software author's homepage.

Anyone running a Sorcerer box sees
how often installed software is updated.
By the time anyone could manually concatenate
all the documentation information
such information would gradually becoming obsolete.
That can often be the case with docs available at
The Linux Documentation Project, <A HREF="http://tldp.org">http://tldp.org</A>
The docs there tend to be verbose, useful,
and provide a quick start at understanding.
However, to totally understand and be able
to effectively wield some software often
requires visiting the software authors' project page
to find current documentation.

Some of those most useful utilities on a Sorcerer box
are bash, man, grep, sed, findutils,
and everything installed by coreutils.
And all that awesome software has manual pages.

$ man bash

The bash manual page is long, informative,
and essential for understanding how to gain
the most when writing BASH shell scripts.
The other software mentioned,
such as: sed; grep; find; sort; uniq; and xargs,
become very useful in shell scripts for
processing data quickly through pipes.

I used to teach Unix System Administration,
and I will tell you that Sorcerer does not teach
nor does it provide documentation that will
teach someone to become a Unix SA.
However, I can tell you the most important information,
about being a SA.

First, SA must be tenacious.
Second, SA must know how to learn what is needed to be known.

So what did I do for my students?
Mostly, I provided them with URLs and told them to go read,
and I provided them with tasks to accomplish.

POSIX, Portable Operating System for Unix,
is what we use.
That enables us to compile sources intended
to be run on UNIX, yet instead run them on our
boxes that use a linux kernel and glibc.
Much source today contains glibc-ism and gcc-ism
that make successful compilation a chore on anything that differs.

I encounter that sort of problem.
Often software that compiles fine on a glibc based installation
will not compile on a uClibc based installation.
That is one of the reasons I am not sharing my uClibc port of Sorcerer.
Writing all the required patch files to make software work
is such a chore for uClibc.

However, my point in discussing that is to show
that POSIX, and especially, glibc + gcc + linux
implementations are becoming more common than UNIX.
So that said you can rest easily knowing that
the choice of glibc + gcc + linux is a good combination,
and yes there are other combinations available.

Wanting documentation is great.
Knowing where to find it is even better.
Knowing what Sorcerer is or what any distribution is
helps explain why not much documentation need be
provided except for that which describes the init-system
and the package or source management tools.

If a distribution were a toy it might most likely be something
like a building block set, like leggos for example.
The individual software components are the building blocks.
The distribution helps the SA snap together software
in an arrangement that makes sense
and should be durable and not topple over.

# augur installed

A typical box will have 300 to 1000 spell installed software projects.
My workstation has nearly 600.
Locating and reading the documentation for all that installed software
would considerable advance a person's understanding of their box.
Most already have installed manual + info pages + docs.
To learn more visit the homepage with a web browser.
Homepages are easy to discover:

# augur homepage bind
<A HREF="http://www.isc.org/products/BIND">http://www.isc.org/products/BIND</A>

The distribution specific tool for Sorcerer is called sorcery
and the catalog for software available for immediate installation
is called the grimoire.
grimoire means book written in Latin,
but it really is not that difficult to read.
Spell format is mostly intuitive,
but there are over 3000+ examples to take a look at.

The major program tools for sorcery are:
augur; cast; dispel; leech; sorcery.
Rarely does a SA invoke leech,
but leech is for downloading
what is necessary for installing software.

augur is an informational tool.
cast installs software
dispel makes installed software go away
and sorcery provides some nice menus
for configuration of sorcery features,
many of which can be merely toggled on or off.

The choice of words for sorcery tools might seem odd,
but they make perfect sense if one looks the word up
in a dictionary.
The overall theme of the distro is magic,
because we wish our boxes did work easily like magic,
but of course they require effort instead.
However, the magical theme should help make
remembering the names of the tools easier for
English speakers while also making the names
of such tools unique.
Having the names of the tools collide with
the names of other software which could be installed
would be problematic.

There is a program called moc, music on console.
And originally the software wrote and named the
command line utility for moc, moc.
Makes sense, yes?
But he did not know that KDE was already using
moc and installing a moc program.
So having both moc and kde installed concurrently was problematic.
Now moc installs it's program with a slightly different name.

This is important because most software is run
without specifying exactly where it is installed in the filesystem.
Instead the environment variable PATH is used to describe
the directories where executable programs should be searched
when running programs.
Therefore, two moc could be installed in separate directories.
But since moc would normally be run via the PATH
knowing how to when to set which directory first
in the PATH would be a PAIN.  :)
And no PAIN is not an environment variable.

Lastly, Sorcerer contrasts with many distros in
deciding what type of SA to appeal to.
Some distros are very fluffy with many menus
and interfaces and stuff to guide SAs into doing
things a certain way and/or asking the SA for
info and then doing something with the info
without really telling the SA what is happening.
That is why we have SAs that do not know how
to do stuff like set up networking
unless there is some ultra fluffy bunny slipper front-end
program to help them &quot;make it so.&quot;

Sorcerer is not a distro designed to attract inexperienced SAs.
Such distros are like being trapped
in a installation menu that never ends.
Not everyone wants that stuffy experience.

Instead Sorcerer is designed for the experienced SA
that wants to have software compiled and installed exactly
the way that they decide is essential and proper.

Yes, the Install/Rescue disk is a pre-packages starter kit,
but after that each Sorcerer box can become their own universe.
With few exceptions all the installed software is compiled
on the box and therefore can be modified, configured,
and customized by the SA.
To a reasonable extent Sorcerer boxes are self-healing
and adjust automatically to the transition of newer libraries
without having installed software come unglued and
refusing to run.

Sometimes I say that Sorcerer is like using
&quot;Linux from Scratch,&quot; but with having your own junior SA
to order around to do mundane stuff.
However, Sorcerer is way more advanced that that.
I conjecture that a SA who tries the &quot;Linux from Scratch&quot; experience
will already have obsolete software installed before
completing the installation of all the software that is desired.
Probably completing a &quot;Linux from Scratch&quot; book
could require a week's worth of serious effort, or perhaps a month.
However, in contrast to Sorcerer,
following the &quot;Linux from Scratch,&quot; experience will
grant a SA a very good understanding of how installed
software fits together and works together
and exactly what would be required for a minimally useful
loadout of installed software.

<A HREF="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/</A>

Although SAs report that they learned lots with Sorcerer,
statements such as,
&quot;I learned more using Sorcerer in 2 months
than I learned using XYZ distro for 2 years!&quot;
Such SAs would fall off their chair by what
would be learned by doing the &quot;Linux from Scratch&quot; experience.
It is much like a workbook with some explanation.
To progress meaningfully and gain skill and knowledge
the SA will type all of the commands and await the outcomes.
It is not like Sorcerer where a SA types
# cast bash
And then bash source is downloaded, configured, compiled, installed.

With &quot;Linux From Scratch&quot;
the SA will download software, unarchive tarballs,
configure sources, make, and make install them
write init-scripts and configuration files, etc...
Forgo the awesome comfortable easy experience of Sorcerer
and try the raw, slice and dice, dirt under the fingernails,
sweat pouring down the neck experience of &quot;Linux From Scratch.&quot;
That will make a SA out of a SA.  *lol*
And it will require much tenacity and effort to complete.

I conjecture that if someone read the HowTos
at the Linux Documentation Project, all installed manual pages,
info pages, and installed documentation, and remote documentation
available at or near a software authors homepage,
and did Linux From Scratch
then that would make a SA out of anyone with sufficient tenacity.

Although I have not checked in more than a decade
some book stores used to sell somewhat thick and expensive
books that would supposedly teach someone how to be a SA.
But it is basically concatenated documentation about software
projects that would commonly be installed on a distro.
It provides a nut-shell type experience.
But any book like that depreciates faster than a new car.
It is 5% to 10% incorrect to being with
and after a year or two becomes about 20% to 30% obsolete.
I discourage learning from those types of books
when one has an actual awesome Sorcerer box to learn from.
Nothing nutshell book is better than learning
about the actual software installed and available for use.

To be perfectly straight and honest about that
I wasted plenty of money in the 80s buying expensive
books on programming languages and by buying
Compilers from Borland, and Assemblers from Microsoft.
The amazing amount of information provided for free
on the world wide web obsoletes expensive book learning
for the purpose of gaining IT ability and knowledge.
The amazing amount of free software and free docs
is as mind blowing as a linux based POSIX.
Sure even in the 80s we could see the foundation
of free software growing, but it would have been
difficult for almost anyone in the 80s
to imagine that it would have turned out this awesome!
The proof of that is shown by how many people are
still ignorant of POSIX and
are using commercial operating systems.
They still do not know.

Well, sorry for being verbose there.
Sorcerer is basically a distro for SAs that know.
Since it lacks fluff SAs that do not know wonder how.
However, for example, all the same command line
utilities that would be used network configuration on
some other distro are available also on Sorcerer.
Sorcerer merely lacks a distribution specific fluffy
bunny slipper menu to gently ask SA questions
and then automatically do all the work for setting up networking.

However, since each Sorcerer box is intended to be like
an individual universe at the command of a SA
the sorcery tools might be more powerful and
have more functionality than a SA will fully use.

So Sorcerer is power for the SA
and no fluffy bunny slippers for wimps.
*chuckle*

# augur forget etc; cast etc

That provides a little bit of fluffy comfort mostly
for those that might not know what files are
important in /etc/
And that is just about all the fluffiness provided.
However, KDE, GNOME, and some of the
other software that can be installed have
their own fluffed out configuration menus
that might be useful for configuring things
on a Sorcerer box.
I do not know exactly.
I tend to edit files in /etc/ using nano.
That is my preference.

Oh lastly, I want to add in the information that....
Sorcerer boxes do not tend to brand nor do
any unnecessary modification to software before installation.
&gt;<i>From remote examination a Sorcerer box can not be easily identified,
</I>except that it would appear to be running a linux 2.6 kernel.
The constantly updating and changing software,
combined with no branding,
and combined with SA implemented stealth techniques
can make Sorcerer boxes both a daunting and discouraging
target for attacks.
It might not be a whole lot of extra protection,
but sometimes it might just be enough.

It is not coincidental or by chance that Sorcerer is a stealthy distribution.
Although we make no over-the-top attempt at it
providing vanilla software tends to be sufficient
in contrast to the excessive branding some distros do.
Typically, senior level SAs might not want others to be able
to know or identify the hardware and/or software of a server.
In the past bind running on TLD name servers was modified
to not provide information about which version of bind it was.
Basically, the fewer clues provided from running services
then the less likely successful conjectures can be made about
installed software, versions, vulnerabilities, and choice of attack.

I almost never discuss that and take it entirely for granted.
I am not promoting Sorcerer for glory and recognition.
I am trying to provide a distro that senior level SAs
would want to use and contribute to.
I would not want to run some gaudy shitty distro
that makes me pay for security updates or
so I have to manually check a directory for RPMs and
remember if I downloaded and installed the updated RPMs.
And then by the time the box is finally good to go
and there are no more runtime errors and security vulnerabilities,
the distro maintainers announce that installed disto version is
obsolete, no longer maintained, and I must buy new
installation CDs to entirely re-install a deployed box
instead of updating it!

Sure Sorcerer requires a SA actually have to read manual pages
and browse the world wide web searching for documentation,
but we do not give SAs the rash and itch that comes from using
a pre-compiled binary based distros.

In my opinion distros are a matter of preference.
Some distros are what one would see if one wanted
to rape the wallets of SAs while providing mostly free software.
Others are the type of distro that appeals to experienced SAs
who want current, free software, with no fees,
with no flaming banners advertising what their box is,
and without a pathetic complete re-installation every year or two.

To fully appreciate Sorcerer a SA should have a few years
of running pre-compiled binary based distros and some
experience with &quot;Linux From Scratch.&quot;
Then one can see that while Sorcerer lacks fluff
it does provide excessive convenience and power
that is lacking from both the paid experience
and the raw experience.
There might be not more than a handful of SAs
that began their POSIX experience with Sorcerer and enjoyed it.
It is far from impossible, but it is like a 4 year old person
learning to solo ride on a 10 speed bicycle that lacks training wheels.
