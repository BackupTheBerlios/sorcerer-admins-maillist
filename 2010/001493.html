<PRE>I take screen locking for granted.
I do not waste CPU cycles on screensaver programs,
no matter how eloquent and mesmerizing.
However, my favorite type of lock is not slock, but glock.
Light, fast to field strip, easy to clean,
trigger pull as light as a single action,
but has the convenience of double action re-cocking.
What's not to like?

Speaking of not liking....
Looks like KDE stopped releasing security patches
sometime during the 3.5.x releases.
So for SAs with lots of KDE deployed issuing a department wide
email to use a different screen locking program
is a huge inconvenience and potential security problem.
I can understand wanting to blame it on the Sorcerer team,
but KDE is not software that Sorcerer authors wrote.
We just make it compile and install.
And the quality after that
is the responsibility of the software authors.

Seconding guessing the KDE team is not something we should do,
because seriously, they know the guts of KDE
while we are just KDE users.
So the 4.4.0 release was going go distribution wide
merely because the KDE software authors stated it was stable.
As soon as KDE authors make a new release
I will try to make it available and hopefully
that will fix the crashing of the KDE screen locking
and error handling programs.

Oh, there it is.  KDE 4.4.1
Woah, faster than pizza delivery in the 1980s.
I will be testing that today and tomorrow.
Chances are the requirements are nearly the same.
So if you want to try it sooner than later feel free
to give it a compile.
I hope screen locking and konsole crashing bugs are fixed.
