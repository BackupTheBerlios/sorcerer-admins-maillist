<PRE>Hmm...
Anything started by /etc/init.d/networks
is probably within it's session or maybe not.
There might not be a session type solution
to this problem unless dhcpcd is started using
a wrapper that writes it's PID to a file.
If dhcpcd is started by it's own init-script
instead of through /etc/init.d/networks
then that seems possible.
Or the template or library used by the template
used to invoke dhcpcd should use the wrapper
script provided by init-functions to grab the PID
of dhcpcd, assuming dhcpcd does not write it's own PID file.
The PID will probably also be the SID
and is worth keeping if intending to treat it as a SID.

However, not all the time should dhcpcd be started first.
For example, in order to use dhcpcd over wireless
first the wireless must be configured along with
the key or other program such as wpa_supplicant.
Perhaps in some cases wpa_supplicant can probably
invoke dhcpcd as needed depending upon when
it changes and/or reconnects to a base.

Networking is a bit of a complicated subject since
there is only a nearly infinite amount of right ways
to configure it.

I am still of the opinion that networking configuration
should be improved on Sorcerer.
Yet I have no clear idea of what an improved
state should look like or how to achieve it.
Technically, networking configuration can even be
configured to work hot-pluggable with udev
so that networks can be configured when a device
is present at boot or plugged/unplugged during running.

Networking devices can be configured through
wireless tools, partially, statically configured by ip,
dynamically configured by dhcp, and/or a combination
of static/dynamic configuration by wpa_supplicant,
and/or some combination of the above initiated by udev,
and/or started and controlled by init-scripts.

I am a bit bewildered.
Maybe udev is the way to go,
however not all networking devices are hot-pluggable.
And then udev might hand off to wireless tools,
ip, or dhcp.
But the problem with udev is that udev is runlevel insensitive.
Maybe the scripts can be designed to be aware of the runlevel.
Yet definitely, some runlevels are not for networking.
So in some sense having networking controlled by runlevel
might make sense.
However, in some cases, such as a box with /usr or /
mounted from NFS, networking must be started during
sysinit.
Should networking start during sysinit?
Maybe it does normally, or sometimes, I do not know.

Obviously, having networking set up as soon as possible
enables the best possibility of being able to rescue a box.
Not that outside connections are permitted in,
but the SA on a box that can only boot initramfs
might be able to scp some useful software into
the broke box from some other box.
If I did not have a method
of continuation of booting should udev fail
then a SA might have to scp in an older version
of a udev archive from a different box
in order to continue booting.
And since networking configuration does not
have to be handled by udev
then perhaps better if udev is not involved.
That way if udev is flaking or the rules are broke
then networking can be started directly or by an init-script.

If all that read as a bit confusing
then it successfully conveys my confusion
about the best way to handle network configuration.

I want to change/improve networking.
But at the same time I am reluctant to change it
without realizing what is better.
I recognize that udev can be part of the network
configuration process,
yet I have entirely avoided writing any rules
or scripts to make that possible.

With the exception of networking
almost everything else about booting a box
seems very obvious in both how to accomplish
and when to accomplish the task.

Possibly if networking is divided separate init-scripts
that execute in an order such as:
wireless configuration;
tunnel configuration;
wpa_supplicant configuration;
PPPOE configuration;
static configuration;
dynamic configuration.

Then, perhaps that might just work.
There is probably more to networking
than I know about.
But in general that order above seems correct.

Does have a drawback...
If the SA unplugs and plugins the wireless network device
then the SA must run again the wireless configuration
and then the static/dynamic and/or wpa_supplicant configuration
Basically, everything except an always plugged in
wired network device might require more than
one init-script to be run in proper order
in order to set up networking.

Is trying to create a properly ordered division of labor
with individual init-scripts as suggested above
better than having a single /etc/init.d/networks
that can start networking based upon templates
that a SA fills out?

What about the potential loss of convenience
of having a networking device configured automatically
if it is unplugged and then replugged?

The current implementation of networking configuration
on Sorcerer is far less than what it could be.
But it could also be more of a pain.
