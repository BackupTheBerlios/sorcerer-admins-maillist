<PRE>The minimum amount of partitions varies depending
upon the filesystem on the primary partition &quot;/&quot;
xfs, for example lacks a boot block,
so lilo must be installed to the MBR
or there must be a /boot partition.

Any filesystem on a LUKS encrypted device
can not also be a filesystem that holds the
linux kernel and initramfs.
While lilo can load a kernel and initramfs stored
on an encrypted filesystem
lilo can not decrypt those files.
An encrypted kernel and encrypted initramfs
can not be used for booting.
Therefore, when &quot;/&quot; is on LUKS encrypted device
then a separate unencrypted ext2 /boot partition is required.

If &quot;/&quot; is a mdraid or a LVM2
then depending upon the type
a separate /boot partition might be required
since lilo will not be loading kernels or initramfs
that are spread out over multiple physical devices.

When in doubt create a 1G, or if space permits, a 2G /boot partition.
And for maximum usefulness make it the first
partition on disk so it receives low cylinder numbers.

Linux kernels are a few megabytes compressed.
A set of modules for a linux kernel is usually between
30M compressed to 70M uncompressed,
even more if not properly stripped,
and considerable more if containing debug information.
And about 10M to 50M of files from the /bin /sbin /etc /lib /lib64
are included on an initramfs.
Therefore, a typical uncompressed initramfs
will be about 90M to 100M
That is how the measurements look today.
Years from now the requirements may differ.
a 1G /boot should be sufficient for the next few years.
If a box is intended to be deployed
and updated for 5 years or longer
then allocating a nice large /boot
gives room to grow.
Also additional free space on /boot
can be used to create swapfiles
in situations where the SA deems
the extra virtual memory necessary.
Swapfiles on /boot will have less of
a performance impact than swapfiles
on / because swapfiles on /boot will
probably be less fragmented and also
cause no fragmentation to the / filesystem.

Perhaps no form of software based encryption
is perfect since requires an unencrypted /boot
that stores an unencrypted kernel and unencrypted initramfs
that can be tampered with.
However, for laptop and notebooks used in sensitive areas
of for private use
a LUKS encrypted / should add some security.
If the laptop is stolen and not returned
then the data encrypted on / would be inaccessible.
If returned then the kernel or initramfs could be trojaned
and the data could be stolen after the SA enters the password
for the key to mount the encrypted /

One of the best solutions for security on a laptop
is to have the the fixed disk's partition entirely encrypted
and have /boot exist separately on a removable USB thumb drive.
Easier to keep the key secure rather than the laptop.
Since the USB /boot &quot;key&quot; is definitely the weak link
the data on the laptop can be stolen provided vulnerabilities
in installed software are exploited while the laptop is running
or if the USB /boot &quot;key&quot; is stolen, trojaned, and returned.

Merely, having a BIOS password to boot
is not sufficient protection against having
unencrypted data removed from the fixed disk of a stolen laptop.

The question of using a /boot partition
or using only a single partition
comes down to SA preference.
The SA preference determines if a /boot is necessary.
If the SA makes a mistake and deploys a configuration
where /boot is required
then the SA will likely have to re-install the box
with a /boot in order for it to be bootable.
So when in doubt make a /boot partition also.
At worst having a /boot
will waste a few megabytes of disk space
while booting will be a bit faster
for reduced fragmentation on /boot.
