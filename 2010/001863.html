<PRE>OK, some init scripts do not really play nice with the PID file.

There is not much we can do about that.

However, the initscript itself is a wrapper for whatever service it is
calling.
At the very least, it can write it's exit status to a file where another
process that absolutely depends on that process having started can check to
see if it did.

The mounting init-script ( for instance) does not have a PID at all, because
after the script has run, it exits. However, if it's exit status was known,
another script can see if it's worth it to even run.


We should define which scripts are absolutely critical to a running Sorcerer
system, and those should give you a command line if they fail to run, and
not run the following scripts as you may muck up a perfectly good working
system.

If for instance, an SA adjusted the running kernel so that the root
filesystem type is no longer recognizable, there is no point in loading
anything else... the system is unbootable, and the SA should be informed,
and the system not try to boot until the problem has been rectified. A
command line at this point would be helpful at this point too.

I am sure there are a few more examples of critical scripts that, if
activated, must absolutely be run.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math
</I>&gt;<i> functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs that do
</I>&gt;<i> not require the guarantees of these specifications.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apparently, even with computers
</I>&gt;<i> compromises are made that favor
</I>&gt;<i> either speed or control, but not both.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Evert makes some interesting points about PID files.
</I>&gt;<i> But what can we deduce about the status of a box
</I>&gt;<i> by examining a PID or a PID file?
</I>&gt;<i> Much discussion has involved udev,
</I>&gt;<i> because of udev's obvious importance on a box.
</I>&gt;<i> So let us stick with that example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> udevd does not have a PID file.
</I>&gt;<i> However, when it runs it does have a PID
</I>&gt;<i> Usually it has between 1 and 3 PIDs.
</I>&gt;<i> The presence of a PID for udev indicates only one thing.
</I>&gt;<i> the PID indicates that the daemon is running
</I>&gt;<i> and probably listening for hotplug events.
</I>&gt;<i> Just because udev is running is not by itself
</I>&gt;<i> proof that the nodes contained or not contained in /dev
</I>&gt;<i> are usable, correct, or complete.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the device nodes in /dev are created
</I>&gt;<i> by a cooperation of a running udevd and the
</I>&gt;<i> invocation of udevadm trigger
</I>&gt;<i> This causes a replay of cold plug events
</I>&gt;<i> that udev handles by loading modules,
</I>&gt;<i> loading firmware, and creating device nodes in /dev
</I>&gt;<i> according to installed udev rule files.
</I>&gt;<i> udevadm, although it provides a service,
</I>&gt;<i> does not remain running like a daemon.
</I>&gt;<i> Whether the device nodes are created correctly
</I>&gt;<i> used to depend almost entirely upon udev rules,
</I>&gt;<i> but now that /dev is devtmpfs instead of just tmpfs
</I>&gt;<i> it has a greater probability of containing necessary
</I>&gt;<i> device nodes even if udev rule files are incorrect or missing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I am explaining the complexity of udev
</I>&gt;<i> is to make the assertion that the mere presence of
</I>&gt;<i> a PID or a PID file does not indicate that the content
</I>&gt;<i> of /dev is proper or complete.
</I>&gt;<i> Whether /dev is usable might not be known
</I>&gt;<i> until a fsck of filesystems
</I>&gt;<i> or a mount of of filesystems is attempted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would go as far as to conjecture that knowing
</I>&gt;<i> if udev failed at the proper creation of /dev
</I>&gt;<i> might not be assumable by checking the presence of
</I>&gt;<i> device nodes in /dev/ for the devices defined by filesystems in /etc/fstab
</I>&gt;<i> No lockfile, no PID file, and no PID can indicate
</I>&gt;<i> if /dev/ is complete and usable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is why I created the kernel command line parameter &quot;coldplug&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> If the SA suspects that the problem is udev related
</I>&gt;<i> then udev can be circumvented with that command line parameter.
</I>&gt;<i> A previously saved order list of modules can be loaded
</I>&gt;<i> while a previously saved /dev/ is copied to /dev/
</I>&gt;<i> In many situations that would be enough to
</I>&gt;<i> circumvent a problem with udev
</I>&gt;<i> and allow a box to continue booting.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, I have not decided exactly what
</I>&gt;<i> should be checked in order to activate
</I>&gt;<i> the coldplug safeguard automatically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I stated several times before
</I>&gt;<i> the menu that allows SAs to select
</I>&gt;<i> a root partition when a root partition
</I>&gt;<i> is not specified in /etc/fstab
</I>&gt;<i> is an example of the precise application
</I>&gt;<i> of control to bring about a desirable outcome
</I>&gt;<i> that enhances robustness of booting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Control should be added when the potential
</I>&gt;<i> outcome increases robustness.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the gain depends upon correctly
</I>&gt;<i> anticipating and intercepting specific problems.
</I>&gt;<i> Adding a control which treats
</I>&gt;<i> the red failure text of all init-scripts exactly the same
</I>&gt;<i> is not the anticipation and interception of a specific problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a more robust boot is desirable
</I>&gt;<i> then we should focus upon:
</I>&gt;<i> identifying where problems will occur;
</I>&gt;<i> why the problem occurs;
</I>&gt;<i> and what can be done about a problem,
</I>&gt;<i> before the problem gathers mass like a snowball rolling down hill.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Spotting and solving problems with
</I>&gt;<i> pin point precision will prevent pain.
</I>&gt;<i> SAs do not want booting to interrupt
</I>&gt;<i> or omit the execution of important init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> which turns into a nightmarish Easter egg hunt.
</I>&gt;<i> They want to boot up, log in, and review log files and log out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the recent past,
</I>&gt;<i> Evert made a suggestion for the Install/Rescue disk
</I>&gt;<i> to present a menu while booting that will allow
</I>&gt;<i> the SA to select a device to mount for the root
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the I/Rs initramfs.
</I>&gt;<i> And the menu does other neat things also.
</I>&gt;<i> I forgot exactly what it can do.
</I>&gt;<i> But it is nice that is there
</I>&gt;<i> in case I want to use it to do that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thinking that a menu like that would be useful
</I>&gt;<i> is a good example of preemptive thinking.
</I>&gt;<i> Evert anticipated some problems that could happen
</I>&gt;<i> and decided that an init-script could provide an adequate solution.
</I>&gt;<i> Even more than that,
</I>&gt;<i> that init-script demonstrates the nearly untapped potential
</I>&gt;<i> init-scripts have for being able to accomplish
</I>&gt;<i> more than the 3 simple tasks of mounting virtual filesystems,
</I>&gt;<i> loading modules, and running daemons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If control is added in the form of init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> then potentially beneficial outcomes can be created
</I>&gt;<i> where the potential for keeping a boot on target
</I>&gt;<i> would be commensurate with the added overhead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The collection of init-scripts Sorcerer currently uses
</I>&gt;<i> can be described as fire-and-forget.
</I>&gt;<i> Successful outcomes are assumed.
</I>&gt;<i> Provided that a Sorcerer box is not too far from the norm
</I>&gt;<i> then the box will successfully boot even if the logs
</I>&gt;<i> contain a line or two of red marks.
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, booting could benefit from a bit of additional control.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet, how that control is added will determine
</I>&gt;<i> if the control is beneficial or detrimental.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rather that creating a generic method for control that
</I>&gt;<i> automatically snowballs errors
</I>&gt;<i> into avalanches of init-scripts that are not executed
</I>&gt;<i> why not implement tiny specific methods for control
</I>&gt;<i> that nudge booting back onto track when
</I>&gt;<i> something undesirable happens?
</I>&gt;<i> The goal should be to have an outcome where the
</I>&gt;<i> box boots and the real root filesystem mounts.
</I>&gt;<i> Should not methods of control be designed
</I>&gt;<i> with that goal firmly in mind?
