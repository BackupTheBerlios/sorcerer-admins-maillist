<PRE>I admit that tcp_wrappers is a necessary evil
for making some software work.
But if there is a lingering popularity for tcp_wrappers
then where is the source being maintained?
I saw a replacement for it on freshmeat dated in 2003.
But those hyperlinks are dead.
Did the project discontinue due to apathy?

Although I have not looked
at tcp_wrappers source in great detail
I would expect that since it receives TCP requests first
tcp_wrappers could become a target for attack.
Could there be a tcp_wrappers targeted attack
upon sshd or some other tcp_wrappers enabled
service that could break into a box?
openssl and openssh are updated almost constantly
fixing potential security vulnerabilities and bugs.
Consequently, we can rest easy at night
expecting that our current version of openssh
should not be an easy egg to crack.
However comparing tcp_wrappers releases to openssh
protection from tcp_wrappers feels like a
13 year old condom baked in sunlight.

I want to know if we can do better than tcp_wrappers.
That is why I did a quick scan on freshmeat
to see if there was a replacement.
I did not look over hill an dale for a replacement.
I should have checked google.
But then the power went out
due to summer lightening storms.

tcp_wrappers release is 13 years old.
If the date on the ftp server is accurate
then that much can be accepted as fact.
Does that not warrant concern?
Is there no security auditing on it?
Do we want software that has not
been updated nor audited for 13 years
to act as a prophylactic for where our boxes'
sensitive services are exposed to the Internet?
Does such a concern seem irrational?

My suggestion that SAs avoid using tcp_wrappers
is an attempt to make their boxes more secure
rather than less secure.
Smug feelings about using tcp_wrappers
might turn into irate vehemence
if we became aware of an effective attack
that can be used on tcp_wrappers enabled boxes.
If someone discovered how to break into boxes
or even DOS services
by exploiting a bug in tcp_wrappers and
did a massive simultaneous attack
then that would be the stuff of movies.  *lol*

Hopefully, that helps explain my point of view
so my perspective does not seem extreme,
but instead only cautious and concerned.
