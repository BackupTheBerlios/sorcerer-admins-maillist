<PRE>Thanks for the feedback.
Hearing opinions both in favor and against
the current init-script policies is important.

Ever since I set this unfavorable policy about
init-scripts being non customize-able executable files
strong opposition to the policy has existed.
However, init-scripts are not configuration files.
Therefore, modifications are not preserved.

More importantly, modification can lead to problems
that a SA would not easily perceive, expect,
nor be able to discover without adequate knowledge
of how the stock init-scripts have changed and evolved.

If customized init-scripts were supported
then nothing about
# ls -lah /etc/init.d/
would screams out, &quot;I have been customized.&quot;
Potential problems caused by SA customized init-scripts
would be more difficult to spot and probably more difficult to fix.

/etc/init.d/README

contains information about how to
create custom init-scripts from a stock init-scripts.
It describes how to disable the stock init-script,
and how to make the custom init-script assume
the purpose of the stock init-script.
A custom init-script has a different name than a stock init-script.
More importantly, a custom init-script is not owned by an installed spell.
Therefore, a custom init-script does not
fit the definition of a customized configuration file.

SAs disabling important init-scripts and
using their own instead can be a significant danger.
Doing so requires every bit of the inconvenience
of using the method described in /etc/init.d/README
instead of trying to customize a stock init-script
and expecting those changes to be automatically preserved.

This way the SA will not so easily forget what changes they made.
# ls -lah /etc/init.d/
will scream out the custom init-scripts
while the stock init-scripts will obviously be non-executable.
A SA can easily diff the custom init-script with the stock init-script.
This way the if the changes seem greater
than what the SA intended
then the SA can carefully compare and examine both files
to determine how to update and fix the custom init-script.

When evaluating whether this is a good, bad or an adequate compromise
please first read /etc/init.d/README
Creating custom init-scripts is not easier
than creating customized init-scripts.
However, please consider whether
creating custom init-scripts might be better
than creating customized init-scripts.

The policy of init-scripts not being customizable config files
does not prevented SAs from having absolute control
over which init-scripts execute.
It does not deny SAs absolute control over the content
of those init-scripts which run.
However, a method that requires custom init-scripts
should help mitigate the worst possible scenario.
The SA should still have the original stock init-scripts
in /etc/init.d/ and therefore be able to fix the box
even when booted with kernel parameter: rdinit=/bin/bash

Also, if a SA is trying out a temporary fix or improvement
by modifying a stock init-script in /etc/init.d/
then such a change that might be accidentally forgotten
would not propagate into a future problem by having
init-scripts preserved as if they were configuration files.

In years past I occasionally made my own share of
careless edits of files in /etc/init.d/
An interruption, having to rise from my chair
to attend something else for a moment,
could become just enough to forget about the a change.
Fortunately, I rest easily knowing that init-scripts
go back to stock after an update of a spell that installed those init-scripts.
My changes and modifications will be lost
unless I did ever step required in order
to create a custom init-script to take over the task.

Also there is the entirely custom /etc/init.d/bootmisc
SAs might not want to create individual
init-scripts to run some programs during boot.
Those programs can be invoked by /etc/init.d/bootmisc

I like to have /etc/init.d/bootmisc
start a script that monitors the wireless connection
that reload the module or restarts the interface as needed
in order to recover unattended from a disconnect.
Sometimes I include commands to invoke hdparm.
/etc/init.d/bootmisc is a nice convenience
in the true lazy style of a SA that wants
something to run during boot,
but does not want to waste a moment
trying to decide exactly when it should run.

The currently policy for /etc/init.d/ has some inconvenience and some
convenience.
However, it is not without merits.
/etc.ori/ is not included on the initramfs.
And fortunately, we never have to look in /etc.ori/init.d/
nor any other unusual place for a stock configuration file.
Files in /etc/init.d/ that were not created by the SA
should be stock unmodified init-scripts.
Careless and temporary edits of init-scripts
should not fester into a serious problem over time.
Instead there is a precise and inconvenient way
for SAs to add a custom init-script
and disable stock init-scripts.
This method should nearly preclude the creation of serious problems.
Immediate problems should not be difficult to fix
using the unmodified stock init-script in /etc/init.d/
Unexpected bewildering latent consequences are entirely avoided.
Stock, current, uncustomized init-script remain in /etc/init.d/
to server as a reference or replcement when a custom init-script breaks.

No SA will be happy about how everything is handled with Sorcerer.
The method for handling modified init-scripts is not intuitive.
I also irritate myself about this!
I want for nearly all aspects about Sorcerer to seem intuitive.

However when considering
using a modified init-script on a permanent basis
the intuitive method must be sublimated
into a more complex method that
emphasis an overt, precise, intentional, reversible change.
The task is not as simple and intuitive
as merely editing and saving a file.
It is not fire and forget.

Accomplish the feat of creating a custom init-script
requires reading the documentation /etc/init.d/README
which is right there where a SA should easily notice it.


Sorry if that presentation seemed too strong.
I want to present points that strengthen the position.
I can not compare Sorcerer's method to Debian method,
because I do not know the method used by Debian maintainers and SAs.
Also I can not state with certainty
whether Sorcerer's method is commensurate with Debian.

The Sorcerer method did not come about
by copying what other distros do.
Instead this method came about from compromise
that addresses both the concerns
of Sorcerer SAs and Sorcerer distribution maintainers.

I do not expect that Sorcerer's method is the best.
However, over the years it has evolved to this
tug of war where neither the SAs nor the maintainers
are being pulled off side.

Maintainers receive their expectation that their
init-scripts will be installed unmodified.
This is important because init-scripts are tiny and simple.
They are without any expectation of modification
by anyone except the distribution maintainer.
They contain no provisions by the distribution maintainer
to anticipate any modifications made by SAs.
Therefore, init-scripts are only expected to work properly
when they are entirely stock and unmodified.
Bug reports about SA modified init-scripts are rejected.
Those who do distribution wide bug fixing
and those provide technical support
want to assume all boxes should work as good
as when the init-scripts were tested
before changes were approved and distributed in the grimoire tarball.
They can not be expected to effectively debug problems
created by a SA by SA provided init-scripts that are specific to the SA's box.

SAs receive their expectation for a method by where
they can throw their sabots into the machine.
And if they followed the documentation
then they have a better than average chance
of being able to fix an unintended consequence
when sabots accidentally become sabotage.
Sabot is shoe carved from wood.
This analogy only serves to imply that
putting one's foot in might ruin the operation of a finely tuned machine.

Does that seem like a bias way of stating the obvious?
Does it grant too much favor to distribution maintainers?
Distribution maintainers must have a near cocky
sense of confidence that their init-scripts should work distribution wide.
It is a considerable burden that requires much conjecture
contemplating and testing since not every type of box can be tested.
When considering the scope of the desired objective
the task of creating those init-scripts is not enviable.

Likewise when a SA introduces a custom init-script
then the assumption is that the SA's init-script
should be far superior for use on that box.
However, tiny mistakes can happen, even a simple typo.
And we do not want for a situation
where the SA is at a prompt during a boot with parameter
rdinit=/bin/bash
while knowing that he bugged up a stock init-script with customization
and is lacking the stock init-script and
is trying desperately to remember
the lines from the original and/or surmise which part has the mistake.
Maybe the SA mistyped a variable such as $RELPY  instead of $REPLY
It happens to me.
However, by following the precise method in /etc/init.d/README
the SA should neither brick their shorts
nor let lose a drop of perspiration.
Instead the SA can copy the original init-script over the custom,
boot normally, and then have another try at creating a custom init-script.

I should explicitly state rather than to imply by example
that the method described in /etc/init.d/README
considered that a SA might modify an init-script
that would run during sysinit.
Buggy init-scripts that start during run level
have a far less dire consequences since
the root file system should already be mounted
and login gettys are presented before the run level begins executing.
That way a SA could log in even if run level execution stalls
due to an init-script that somehow never finishes running.

Is it not annoying that the welcome message
and prompt from a login getty is over written
by programs that start during the run level
and print directly to console or kernel buffer instead of stdout or stderr?
However, this is the reason why Sorcerer boxes
might not have a clean and professional looking login prompt
on virtual console 1.
Instead they receive the guarantee of being able to log in
before the run level begins.
Even if the run level execution stalls and does not complete
the SA can still log in and examine and fix problems.

Such small things might not seem significant alone.
But together they each contribute slightly towards
creating a simple robust and repairable boot method.

As always boot method remains open to debate.
The method and policies can change this year, next year or anytime.
However, changes must provide more boon than bane.
Changes must be reasonable compromises.
We must not sacrifice simplicity for speed
nor sacrifice caution for easy configure-ability.

Reaching consensus about compromises
is perhaps more difficult with Sorcerer than any other distro,
because Sorcerer was design to fit the whims and requirements
of senior level SAs.

Distribution maintainers are the generalists.
They have a good overview.
They see how the big picture fits together.
They can fit the puzzle pieces together.
However, nobody can expect the best fit from a distribution maintainer.
Instead maintainers provide the base or an adequate starting point.

In contrast, SAs are the specialists.
SAs have experience and precise knowledge.
With deployed mission critical software
the SAs ability to achieve the best outcomes
is second only to the software authors.
SAs have the best big picture that involves
configuration and execution of mission critical software
on the boxes that they deploy.

And so the problem is that neither SAs nor maintainers are right or wrong.
Distribution maintainers have the best chance of
creating distribution wide workable solutions.
SAs have the best chance of creating box specific solutions.
This difference in expertise, perspective and role
is exactly the reason why SAs are required for
optimal performance and deployment of boxes.
SAs will see and debug problems that
distribution maintainers might never encounter.

Distribution maintainers keep in view
the large picture, the common denominator,
and the widest possible path to prosperity.
And this is important because it is why we have
things like automatic regeneration of initramfs images,
automatic updating of symbolic links in /etc/rc.d/,
and automatic updating of /etc/lilo.conf and re-installation.
The distribution maintainer is
all about trying to make administration as successful
as possible for as many SAs as possible
on many types of uniquely configured Sorcerer boxes.

So both the distribution maintainers are correct and the SAs are correct.
Since Sorcerer is a distribution designed for senior level SAs
we must continue to discuss the boons, banes and
differences of opinions and ideas about implementaiton
until the most favorable compromises are realized,
become consensus, and are implemented.

Certainly, each point of view has merits.
No way that is accomplishing the task
can be indisputably the wrong way.
Better that we discuss the specific points of each method.
We should realize and preserve the points of merit and strength.
We should illuminate what is lacking and should be discarded or revised.
There is no use in making the generalization that a method stinks.
Instead we should follow our nose to the rotten apple
so that we can precisely excise what is rotten
instead of throwing out the entire basket of fruit.

To say that the current method is &quot;wrong&quot;
implies that the method should be discarded.
And should we put in it's place?
Should we convert to a method that entirely favors SAs?
Or should we convert to a method
that entirely favors distribution maintainers?

Fortunately, we do not have to try either way to know what to expect.
We have the benefit of hindsight.
Sorcerer's current method came about through a compromise
due to trying and bouncing off of the extremes of both method.
To entirely favor either position enables problems to become
something that can be easily fixed by SA and not by maintainer
or easily fixed by maintainer, who might not know about the problem,
while being difficult to fix by SA.
Nobody wants to suffer from an itch
that they can neither reach nor scratch.
Therefore, neither extreme position is beneficial.

I will not go as far as saying that the current compromise is the right method.
But how wrong is it?
It might be a bad compromise, or a bad design, or a bad implementation.
Yet even so it is currently usable.
A common cliche is, &quot;Anything which is usable is not half bad.&quot;

I want to say that that the compromise is uneasy.
Distribution maintainers receive their init-scripts in /etc/init.d/
SAs are not allowed customize spell provided init-scripts.
SAs feel irritated about a lack of automatic deference to their judgment.

However, SAs can create their own init-scripts in /etc/init.d/
SAs also receive the final say about which init-scripts run.

That can create cause for distribution maintainers to feel irritated
and frustrated when a reported problem is due SA provided init-scripts.
A distribution maintainer can not properly conjecture, identify nor
help fix that problem.
The outcome of the situation depends entirely upon the SA
until the SA reveals information that hints the problem
is specific to that box and not distribution wide.

It is a bad compromise because nobody receives exactly what they want.
It is a good compromise because everyone receives what they
grow provided they do not plant it in the other guy's garden.

I want to set that all aside and speak frankly.
I do not like this compromise.
I prefer customizable init-scripts.
I prefer modifications to init-scripts to be preserved.
I want that because
I am an arrogant SA who expects that the knows
the Sorcerer init-scripts better than the back of his own hand.
But the thing about that arrogance is that
I am the person who designed and wrote all those init-scripts.
Unlike other SAs I take for granted
having the knowledge required for creating a customized init-script
with a high probability of success?

So for years Sorcerer init-scripts
were treated as customizable configuration files.
I was a SA.
I had it my way.
It worked for me that seemed great for my boxes.
So what happened to change it?

SAs were reporting problems because their /etc/fstab were missing
entries for virtual file systems like /proc /sys /dev/pts, etc...
SAs were complaining about the long, complex init-scripts.
They were having difficulty modifying them.
They were having difficulty creating them.
Time and time again this reflected as if
the fault was due to the distribution designer/maintainer.
So gradually, things changed.

LSB style init-scripts displaced
the near ad-hoc init-scripts in the grimoire
that were installed using statically assigned numbers
which control order of execution.
Long complicated init-scripts were chopped into
several many smaller role specific init-scripts.
Common code was factored out of init-scripts
and added to  init-functions.
init-scripts improved in quality, conciseness,
and uniformity of output.
Virtual file system mounting was moved from
/etc/fstab into init-scripts
to ensure that virtual file systems
were mounted at the right time,
on the right mount points,
and with the right mounting parameters.
And methods for parallel execution of init-scripts
during run levels was added.

After all of these many fine improvements to
increase the speed, simplicity, appearance,
and robustness of booting
I decided that if SAs want me to do all that
for their box to boot
then who has a justified reason refute
my decision to prevent SAs from
accidentally sabotaging the booting of boxes?
And so I declared that init-scripts were precise,
role specific, finely tuned executable files
and not configuration files.
Therefore, customizations will not be preserved.

That was when SAs started saying that I went too far.
But did it matter?
The situation could not last.
SAs could always find a way to thwart me.
Therefore, if it is their will to do so
then I should write docs installed as /etc/init.d/README
that describes exactly the proper way to thwart
my attempt to control execution of spell provided init-scripts
and how SAs can provide their own init-scripts.
And so I did exactly that.

Perhaps we should pause for a moment to ask,
&quot;Does the distribution maintainer like this added level of complexity
and inconvenience?&quot;
The answer is, &quot;No!&quot;
Even the distribution maintainer is a SA.
And even the distribution maintainer can not customize init-scripts.
He also must go through the steps of creating a SA provided custom init-script.

I want to go back to customizable init-scripts.
I want to go back to the cowboy days where
SAs were expected to saddled their own horse
with a kernel that they configured
or found themselves lacking the skills to ride!
Those where the days when SAs were king in their own kingdoms,
binary based distros caused worry,
a rash and a near annual headache,
and every bug could be blamed on software authors.
That made for great times and fond memories.
But it did not make a for a great distribution.
SAs that lacked amazing skills
could not truck with Sorcerer.

Fortunately, Sorcerer went through evolution and compromise.
It now provides a better experience to a broader audience of SAs.
The cowboys have not entirely departed.
And Sorcerer also has city-slickers that expect
the convenience of plug 'n pray.
They enjoy the convenience and accommodations of a full service stable
that waters, feeds, grooms, saddles, and cleans up after their horse.
And by horse, saddle, and horse manure
I am making an analogy the linux kernel, initramfs, lilo, init-scripts
and everything involved with allowing a box to boot and shut down.
The way Sorcerer is today is much easier.
Almost everything that can be handled automatically has it's own auto-pilot.
It is almost as easy to ride
as a horse that recognizes and accepts both vocal and kick commands.

To regress from that diversion
back to the main point
begs the following question.
&quot;If everything is convenient and automatic
then why is was customization of init-scripts made
into a complicated, non-intuitive, inconvenient mess?&quot;
Well, the answer is that SAs can still be cowboys.
But with init-scripts they receive a short enough piece of rope
to discourage the accidental outcome
of the SA hanging their box to death during boot.

In am imperfect world sometimes imperfect solutions work best.
Yet almost nobody will be happy with this solution,
because nobody will know for certain
if it saved them more headache than it caused.

Now we could try alternate solutions.
We could have custom init-scripts placed in
/etc/init.d.custom/ or /etc/init.d/custom/
If they have the same name
then symbolic links in /etc/rc.d/rc?.d/
could point to the init-script in /etc/init.d/custom/
instead of the stock in /etc/init.d/
Overall that is a little different.
Maybe it is a little more simple.
But it is not more convenient.

Someone should take a new position
and explain the boons and banes.
We could do better than what we have.
But the change should not be made
for an almost significant gain of simplicity
that overall is not any different than the current method.
Instead this requires some fresh creative thinking
to come up with a design that acknowledges both
about what distro designers want and what SAs want.
An idea such as /etc/init.d/custom/ is a good start,
but seems more like a stepping stone than a final destination.

If we borrow a page from the book being written by
the udev software authors
then we see that they moved their rule files from
/etc/udev/rules.d/
to
/lib/udev/rules.d/
SA installed rule files still go into /etc/udev/rules.d/

Not a bad idea since this change intuitively discourages SAs
from modify files installed to /lib/udev/rules.d/
According to the implied, yet not explicitly defined rules:
files in /lib/ are not expected to be modified;
files in /etc/ are expected to be modifiable.
Of course, there are some exceptions to those rules.

So should spell installed init-scripts go into /lib/init.d/
Should /etc/init.d/ be reserved for SA provided init-scripts?
Must SA provided init-scripts precisely replace
the same named init-script in /lib/init.d/
Which set of LSB comments is used?
Do we use the LSB comments from the init-script in /lib/init.d/ ?
Do we use the LSB comment from the init-script in /etc/init.d/ ?
Or do we try to use both?
What if the init-script in /etc/init.d/ does not exist in /lib/init.d/
In that situation should we use the LSB comment in the init-script
that is in /etc/init.d/ ?
Or since the init-script does not also exist in /lib/init.d/
should the init-script with that name in /etc/init.d/ be ignored?

Overall what the udev authors decided seems like a good idea.
I rarely compliment them, but for this they deserve a gold star.
However, a udev rule file is not the same as an init-script.
What they make seem easy
is for us like a shirt with many loose strings.

I have no inclination towards either of the two methods proposed above.
That is not to imply that there is anything wrong with them.
Rather if a change is made
then the boons should not merely outweigh the banes,
but the design and implementation should be so awesome
that contrasting it with our current method gives justified reason to say
that our current method is the wrong way.
Until we have another better bed to sleep in
we would be wise not to discard this one
for merely a few uncomfortable springs.

So after this long email I want to say
that the topic is still on the table and
is still open for discussion.
Alternate designs would be nice.
I gave two above just off the top of my head.
Goes to show that anyone can do it.
So who is feeling inspired?
Let us launch our ideas and take turns shooting them down.
If we find one that we can not blast from the sky
than that will be the new high flying design for Sorcerer.


Thanks for reading.
Sorry for being overly verbose.
