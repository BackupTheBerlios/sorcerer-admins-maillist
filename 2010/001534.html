<PRE>Swapfiles provide the convenience of additional swap space,
however have the overhead of backing it on a filesystem.
swap partitions use less memory and are more efficient
than swap files.
However, I have the menu driven installer create
a minimal size legacy swapfile to ensure that
installation can proceed even if the SA did not
specify a swap partition.
After installation the SA can chose to remove the swapfile
and remove the entry for it from /etc/fstab
Also during the menu driven installation
the SA can select to not have a swapfile
by removing that entry from the fstab menu.

Being able to select device in the fstab menu
allows the SA to create an entry for a device that
might not be listed in /dev/ or perhaps not detected
as a good possible location for a filesystem.
Usually trying to filesystems partitions on a device that
is not listed in /dev/ will fail.
But the SA might do something about that.

Normally, a SA will modify the entries that are already
presented in the fstab menu rather than selecting device
and creating a new entry.

Most Sorcerer SAs create a 2G swap partition.
Excessive swap space does drain RAM resources.
So if additional swap space is required later
then the SA might add that in the form of swap files.

In order for a Sorcerer box to be bootable
all the important and required steps must be completed.
A bootable MBR must be installed.
lilo must be installed to the boot block of /boot/ or /
The partition that contains lilo in the boot block
must be specified as bootable using fstab.

If the installation was complete yet remains non-bootable
then I recommend booting using the I/R and mounting
the fixed disks's / as the / filesystem.
Then login, edit /etc/fstab and /etc/lilo.head
Run fdisk and check that the partition that contains lilo
in the boot block is marked as bootable.
re-run ms-sys to install a bootable MBR if necessary.
Then, issue the shutdown -r command.
After that it should probably be able to boot from the fixed disk.

For over a decade SAs become confused
over what is required to boot.
1: A bootable MBR.
2: Installed LILO
If LILO is installed to the MBR that makes the MBR bootable
However, I do not recommend installing LILO to the MBR
because BIOS might prevent writes to the fixed disks's MBR
if MBR anti-virus protection is enabled.
3. a linux kernel
4. an initramfs image

A Sorcerer box will automatically create initramfs images.
It will automatically update /etc/lilo.conf
and /etc/lilo.conf.fast
It will do many things automatically as needed.
One might say that a Sorcerer box wants
to be bootable from fixed disk or mass storage device.

The menu driven installer will normally mark the partition
containing lilo as bootable automatically.
Hurray for that.
SAs might forget to do that.
When the compile portion of the menu driven installation is complete
then sysvinit init-script symbolic links are updated,
initramfs are generated, and lilo is re-installed to the boot block.
That happens automatically.
So probably the most likely reason that a Sorcerer box
will not boot is because the SA decided not to install ms-sys
to the MBR even when prompted to do so.

However, having something else installed in the MBR is possible.
The SA might want grub or some other boot loader installed in the MBR.
Or the SA might desire a different lilo installed in the MBR that
can chain to the Sorcerer's lilo or some other operating system's
boot loader.

The sorcerer installation process will try to save the SA
from wasting time due to forgetting simple things like
marking a partition as bootable.
However, it does not force the creation of a perfect install.
Simply having some old lilo or some old code from a different
operating system in the MBR will cause a newly installed
Sorcerer box to fail to boot.
That might not be the only reason.
But is among the most likely reasons.

</I>&gt;<i> 3.) /swap (I understand now that this is a swap file, no partition required)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps this is &quot;/&quot; on the CDROM? And I don't need to fill out anything?
</I>&gt;<i> I've even tried deleting that entry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All files seem to copy over from the CDROM onto /dev/hda1 (&quot;/&quot;), but still
</I>&gt;<i> no reboot when everything is complete. I also discovered not to install
</I>&gt;<i> the final packages for ISDN/WLAN/dialup/etc., networking, as it kicks me
</I>&gt;<i> into a blank file in pico. If I just skip those files and let the
</I>&gt;<i> compile/lilo/MBR get written all looks good, except still, no boot after
</I>&gt;<i> reboot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed from Evert's email that he says to umount at the very end, which

</I>&gt;<i> is developing out of this experience LOL!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We don't need a /boot partition do we? This version of lilo and the kernel
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't have a problem with big HDDs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once I figure out what I'm doing wrong, I'm going to experiment with
</I>&gt;<i> deleting the swapfile entry in /etc/fstab during install and just create a
</I>&gt;<i> swap partition. I think that's a better way to go, although I know that
</I>&gt;<i> nowadays many people are just desiring to have swapfiles in their /

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> hm...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your thoughts? Comments?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you wait for than one or two seconds, and receive the console output
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which will confuse someone who hasn't been through the install process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've also included a shot of the rpcbind errors that are received once
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the user selects the keyboard mapping for their locale. This shows the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> errors, early on I believe, that were being experienced with nfsd and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subsequently corrected by commenting out the /etc/rc.* entries discussed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the earlier emails by Evert and Jan.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm currently in the process of building a detailed installation manual,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and I could use some help critiquing it, of course, I'm going to do my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> best NOT to show the errors that are currently showing up in the process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of my own installs :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hopefully, by the time I'm finished those issues will be resolved ;)
