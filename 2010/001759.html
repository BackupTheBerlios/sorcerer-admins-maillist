 Oke

 

Thank you but that did not solved the problem.

 

I tried sleep 1 and sleep 10 and the problems stays.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> POSIX command names like UNIX command names
</I>&gt;<i> often differ slightly than what they probably aught to be.
</I>&gt;<i> The command to search for us umount.
</I>&gt;<i> The line looks like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> LC_ALL=C sort -ur | xargs -r --max-lines=1024 umount -lr
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After that line and before the
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Try inserting
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> sleep 1
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The full command being used to umount filesystems is
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> cut -d ' ' -f2 /proc/mounts |
</I>&gt;<i> LC_ALL=C sort -ur | xargs -r --max-lines=1024 umount -lr
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That means:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using space as a delimiter cut everything from /proc/mounts
</I>&gt;<i> except the second column
</I>&gt;<i> then sort that list into reverse order and eliminate duplicates,
</I>&gt;<i> and finally provide that list as parameters to the umount
</I>&gt;<i> command followed by parameter -lr and with an additional
</I>&gt;<i> list of parameters no greater than 1024 parameters in length.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Shell programming differs from any other type of programming
</I>&gt;<i> that I tried before and in many ways is fun and easy.
</I>&gt;<i> The '|' pipe, the character in between the quotes,
</I>&gt;<i> is a very useful for shell scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> The pipe connects the standard output from the
</I>&gt;<i> program executing in front of the pipe
</I>&gt;<i> to the standard input of the program that
</I>&gt;<i> executes after the pipe.
</I>&gt;<i> The pipe becomes like a bucket brigade.
</I>&gt;<i> But since we are dealing with computers instead of water
</I>&gt;<i> it is a bit bucket brigade. :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If augur is run without parameters
</I>&gt;<i> then it prints a general help screen where
</I>&gt;<i> in one column called Stdin some of the
</I>&gt;<i> parameters have an asterisk *.
</I>&gt;<i> All augur commands support input as
</I>&gt;<i> additional command line parameters.
</I>&gt;<i> However, some of them also will read
</I>&gt;<i> input from stdin.
</I>&gt;<i> In that fashion augur commands can easily
</I>&gt;<i> be joined together using a pipe.
</I>&gt;<i> One of my favorite examples is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # augur lone | augur size | sort -g | tee /tmp/piggy.txt
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That creates the piggy list and saves it to file /tmp/piggy.txt
</I>&gt;<i> while also displaying it as scroll on the screen.
</I>&gt;<i> If a box is low on space or I just want to clean
</I>&gt;<i> wipe away some programs not being used,
</I>&gt;<i> which tends to happen on my test box,
</I>&gt;<i> then I use the piggy list to help decide.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A more menu driven method for removing software
</I>&gt;<i> is to use sorcery's dispel menu.
</I>&gt;<i> That helps the SA select software for removal
</I>&gt;<i> using the same logic used while undressing.
</I>&gt;<i> When undressing could a person remove their
</I>&gt;<i> socks before their shoes?
</I>&gt;<i> Crazy idea yes?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The sorcery's dispel menu also ensures that
</I>&gt;<i> shoes must be selected for removal
</I>&gt;<i> before socks become eligible for removal.
</I>&gt;<i> It is a layered approaching to software removal
</I>&gt;<i> where the outer most layers must be removed first
</I>&gt;<i> in order to unlock installed software that is being kept
</I>&gt;<i> installed because it is required by other installed software.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer boxes have more layers of software than
</I>&gt;<i> a fancy pastry cake and less layers than
</I>&gt;<i> an authentic folded steel Japanese sword.
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately, sorcery is there to help.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, the SA does not have to recognize each layer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Knowing about pipes is useful.
</I>&gt;<i> Knowing about a Sorcerer box's layers of software is useful.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer requirements are always recursive rather than absolute.
</I>&gt;<i> And that is what creates a layered effect.
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, I would want to know about all the software
</I>&gt;<i> installed by the coreutils spell by reading their manual pages.
</I>&gt;<i> After that I would read the manual pages for sed, grep, find, xargs.
</I>&gt;<i> And finally, I would read the manual page for BASH.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # augur install coreutils sed grep findutils bash |
</I>&gt;<i> grep /man/ |
</I>&gt;<i> xargs man
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just press q to progress to the next manual page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that is a lot of reading 101 manual pages,
</I>&gt;<i> and the bash manual page is very long!
</I>&gt;<i> But why all the reading?
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer SAs' skill is proportional to their SA skills
</I>&gt;<i> and almost directly proportional to BASH scripting skill.
</I>&gt;<i> The better a SA's BASH scripting skill
</I>&gt;<i> the more effectively that SA can wield sorcery.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer was originally designed to scratch an itch
</I>&gt;<i> that senior level SAs acquire from using a pre-compiled
</I>&gt;<i> binary based distro.
</I>&gt;<i> And unfortunately, it still remains a tool where skilled
</I>&gt;<i> SAs have a much greater capacity to wield than novice.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, almost any output that can be achieved
</I>&gt;<i> by connecting a few commands together using pipes
</I>&gt;<i> is not usually scripted as a convenient augur command.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, overall the best way to increase a SAs
</I>&gt;<i> ability with sorcery is to increase the SAs ability,
</I>&gt;<i> especially scripting ability.
</I>&gt;<i> With Sorcerer there are not a dozens
</I>&gt;<i> or more GUI programs to learn.
</I>&gt;<i> The most basic sorcerer commands are:
</I>&gt;<i> augur cast dispel leech sorcery
</I>&gt;<i> That in itself is practically nothing to learn,
</I>&gt;<i> about a 15 minute effort at most.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In contrast, learning about coreutils and BASH
</I>&gt;<i> and other things useful for a SA can require
</I>&gt;<i> a week of study.
</I>&gt;<i> However, such knowledge is not insignificant nor
</I>&gt;<i> limited to practical use on Sorcerer boxes.
</I>&gt;<i> coreutils and BASH are installed on almost every POSIX box.
</I>&gt;<i> Even Solaris and UNIX implementations have
</I>&gt;<i> commands with the same names that accept
</I>&gt;<i> similar command line parameters and produce similar output.
</I>&gt;<i> Most if not almost everything learned about while
</I>&gt;<i> administrating a Sorcerer box is also knowledge
</I>&gt;<i> that is applicable while administrating other distros.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, in summary Sorcerer tends to attract
</I>&gt;<i> the type of SAs that could deploy a box without
</I>&gt;<i> a distro or deploy a box with a distro of their own design
</I>&gt;<i> if that SA had sufficient time to accomplish the task.
</I>&gt;<i> That does not make Sorcerer the best distro,
</I>&gt;<i> but it grants experienced SAs nearly as much freedom
</I>&gt;<i> they could want from a distro while still gaining
</I>&gt;<i> the benefits of easy software updating.
</I>&gt;<i> I want to expect about Sorcerer that
</I>&gt;<i> the division of decision of what happens
</I>&gt;<i> is more equally weighted to SAs rather than distro developers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Probably the most significant power struggle in Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> is about the init-scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> It is not just about how init-scripts execute,
</I>&gt;<i> but more importantly about how
</I>&gt;<i> I made a distribution wide decision that init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> are not configuration files and
</I>&gt;<i> therefore init-script content is non-customizable
</I>&gt;<i> unlike other files stored in /etc/
</I>&gt;<i> With that declaration I also made the provision that
</I>&gt;<i> SAs who want a customized init-script
</I>&gt;<i> must take full responsibility for it
</I>&gt;<i> by creating a custom spell which installs that init-script.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, the change I recommended by adding
</I>&gt;<i> a sleep 1 to the /etc/init.d/mount init-script
</I>&gt;<i> would not be a permanent change.
</I>&gt;<i> The next time the &quot;init-scripts&quot; spell casts
</I>&gt;<i> the modified /etc/init.d/mount would be replaced
</I>&gt;<i> by a stock version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since init-scripts can change name, function, and
</I>&gt;<i> even ordering an init-script that would be permitted
</I>&gt;<i> customization today could cause a box fail to reboot a year later.
</I>&gt;<i> That sort of unexpected latency between cause and effect
</I>&gt;<i> could baffle and frustrate a SA.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, most decisions about init-scripts are made
</I>&gt;<i> at the distribution level.
</I>&gt;<i> Such decisions a SA can only overrule by creating custom spells.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, understanding how all the init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> fit together is not unlike assembling a 200 piece jigsaw puzzle.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that helps provide some useful information.
</I>&gt;<i> Much of the documentation that Sorcerer SAs
</I>&gt;<i> would want to use on a daily basis is provided in
</I>&gt;<i> the form of help screens, manual pages, info pages,
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/src/linux/Documentation/ /usr/share/doc/ /usr/doc/
</I>&gt;<i> and basically all of that good stuff is installed on Sorcerer boxes.
</I>&gt;<i> The next best places to look on the World Wide Web are
</I>&gt;<i> google's search engine,
</I>&gt;<i> software author's project and home pages,
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;The Linux Documentation Project.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Most Sorcerer spells have a homepage entry
</I>&gt;<i> that contains the URL to the software author's project
</I>&gt;<i> website or homepage.
</I>&gt;<i> However, Sorcerer itself does not provide much documentation,
</I>&gt;<i> because almost all the docs anyone needs already exists.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer is not unlike a ship in a bottle.
</I>&gt;<i> The bottle is POSIX, Portable Operating System for unIX.
</I>&gt;<i> POSIX defines what is and should be about distros.
</I>&gt;<i> The Sorcerer I/R is like a quick start kit.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcery is like glue and simple tools for fastening pieces together.
</I>&gt;<i> And the individual pieces of the boat
</I>&gt;<i> come from the installed software components.
</I>&gt;<i> Being Sorcerer SA requires
</I>&gt;<i> some effort and some skill.
</I>&gt;<i> But the requirement is not as much
</I>&gt;<i> as compared to someone who builds
</I>&gt;<i> model ships inside of bottles. :)
</I>&gt;<i> Some Sorcerer SAs come to feel a bit of
</I>&gt;<i> pride and affection for their Sorcerer boxes.
</I>&gt;<i> They learn how to care for
</I>&gt;<i> and feed their pet Sorcerer boxes. :)
</I>&gt;<i> It is not a bad experience for SAs that have
</I>&gt;<i> the skill and required tenacity to make their boxes thrive.
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck.
