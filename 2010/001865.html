<PRE>Parameter -r on cast has unpredictable results
depending upon what ends up in the cast queue.
It could reconfigure much more than the
spells listed as command line parameters.
That is why the # augur forget $SPELL
was created.

Somehow I was expecting much more was required
in order to cast linux-custom.
I had expected that I removed the
make menuconfig from the spell.
But however it is now it has been mostly
untouched since it moved to the new name.

Having multiple behaviors relation to autofailure of spells
makes helping SAs more difficult because they will
probably not describe exactly what is ongoing.
Eventually, such decisions usually go the route
of entirely one direction.
For example the only rule used for config files
is the preservation rule and not the backup rule.
Modified configuration files are preserved in /etc/
while fresh new default configuration files
are stored in /etc.ori/
That compromise obtains a bit of the best about both choices.

Autofailure would definitely have one default behavior,
but it probably should not have more than behavior.

If a software project is not installed
then the most probable behavior is that
any software to compile that requires the
missing required software project will fail to compile.
However if a software project fails to compile
but is already installed
then software that requires it will probably
be able to compile using the older than current version.
This enables important security updates to happen
where our current autofail rule might prevent anywhere
from a small to a large selection of software
from being compiled.
Naturally, SAs should be ontop of the situation when
something fails to compile.
But perhaps Sorcerer should try to achieve
best results for the SAs that have their boxes
mostly on autopilot?

Let us count that above as 2 boons for the new method.
In general more software will compile
with a lesser probability of security updates being blocked.
So what convenience do we sacrifice
by switching to the new rule?

All I can think of is that some software might fail to compile
and some might compile twice.
Once before the a failed spell is fixed
and once again after a failed spell is fixed.

On the other hand let us consider....
What if a SA sets a box to update
and there are 90 spells queued.
By the current rule if a compile failure happens
then the SA might return a few hours later
and have 60 autofailed spells.
There is a significant loss of potential CPU cycles
and after fixing the failed spell the SA will
have to wait for 60 spells to compile.

If we change to the new rule
and a failure happens during updating
then when the SA returns the box might
have only 1 spell in the failed queue.
Since that spell is already installed
it did not cause an autofailure for the
other spells waiting to cast.
The SA fixes the one spell, recompiles
and the box is probably done updating.
That seems less problematic
and more efficient for the SA.

The current autofail rule applies to both
new deployments and to updates.
However most boxes do 1 deployment
and hundreds of updates.
Consequently, a new autofail rule is
more favorable for updates and therefore
that should grant it a 3rd boon.

So new rule boons:
1. more software compiles makes for better updating
2. less chance of security fixes being prevented from compilation
3. more efficient for the SA that makes a general time estimate
for all spells queued instead of watching augur scry like a hawk.

The only time where the current autofail rule
is best suited is during initial deployment.
However, during initial deployment software
that fails compilation is also software which is not installed.
And therefore, a failed spell would cause
a cascade of autofailures.

Therefore, in my opinion the proposed modification
to the autofailure rule provides for the type of handling
that we would prefer both during initial deployment
and during updating.
And while it is not a perfect rule it sacrifices
the assumption of failure for convenience provided
by attempting to continue updating software
which in retrospect usually works.

Some combinations of libraries and executables
have a tight fit.
openssl and openssh are a good example.
openssh will usually only run when at runtime
it can find the same version of openssl that
was used to compile openssh.
Software such as libfwbuilder and fwbuilder
have the same point of origin and are
effectively the same software project split
into separate sources.
The situations where a precise version of a library
is required are not only few,
but they also have a very limited area of collateral damage.
When it happens maybe only 1 to 3 other software
projects would be effected and refuse to compile.

Now let us consider an example containing zlib.
Potentially zlib could fail to compile.
However, zlib version 1.2.3 is safe to use if installed.
But by the current rule, if zlib fails to compile
then that could potentially autofail:
# augur aron zlib | wc -l
2706
other spells.

So unless SAs are going to ardently attend updates
then the current autofailure rule could cause more
pain than pleasure.

I am not against entirely removing the autofail rule,
but this compromise to the rule should provide
instances of autofailure that are better suited
overall towards maintaining the security of boxes
where SAs are not actively monitoring updates.
And for SAs fixing failures
the modified rules should further minimize what
ends up in the failed queue and thus
perhaps save the SA from waiting as much
and not knowing when to check for results.

Unless anyone can make a good reason to
maintain the old rule as a possible selection
then I recommend SAs that want to use the old rule
should add a function for it in /etc/sorcery/local.config
That way they do not have to agree with me
in order to have it their way.  :)
The function to replace is called auto_fail()

If the modified rule turns out to be a pain
then we can go back to the old rule
after a few months of trying it out.
I am already feeling happier.
Being the one who tests more updates/
new versions of software than anyone else
I will be pleased to not have 60 spells ejected
from the cast queue because one spell failed to compile.
This change should help expedite
checking/fixing of spells with new versions of software.
