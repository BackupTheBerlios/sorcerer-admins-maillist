<PRE>This may be good to know
since it will eventually be going stable
and installed on Sorcerer boxes.
However, for now it is merely
the unstable version progress of the spell &quot;sorcery&quot;
Currently, it might have as many new fixes as it has new bugs.
However, those who want to test it, only on dev/test boxes,
can switch to the unstable version progress for the &quot;sorcery&quot; spell.

The newer sorcery came about through a discussion with Evert
who wanted more, more, more from augur scry.
So basically, augur scry now has more color,
more lines of recent events, and accepts the key press of &quot;M&quot;
to chain to a dialog driven menu that a few choices such as:
aborting queued spells;
forcing queued spells to being compilation;
Viewing a 7 day current event summary;
or switching to scry on the download
and compilation progress of a queued spell.

Even without the changes
I am complacent with the output of # augur scry
Also I do not mind issuing augur commands from command line.
But I suppose for boxes with only one monitor
these changes might provide a worthy convenience.

Although I try to avoid fixing what is not broke,
in order to make these changes happened
I had to revise the system of event logs.
The event logs are stored different in /var/log/event/
They also tend to use less space.
And they provide a bit more information
even when glanced by using

# ls /var/log/sorcery/event | column -t
or
# ls /var/log/sorcery/event | cat

As evident more useful information about the event
is stored directly in the file name instead of merely
within the file.
This seems to work since no versions for spells
are currently unsuitable for use as parts of file names.

Also the categorization of event logs has changed.
I want to expect that the new names for events
is somehow more intuitive.
However, if not so
then there is a nice long help page
that describes event names in detail
that is accessible by running:

# augur help event

Event names are described by two words.
The first word tends to describe the outcome,
such as Pass or Fail
The second word tends to describe more precisely the type of event.
Here are some examples:

&quot;Pass Load&quot; indicates software successfully downloaded.
&quot;Pass Cast&quot; indicates software installed from source.
&quot;Pass Rise&quot; indicates software installed from /var/cache/archive
&quot;Pass Oust&quot; indicates the SA drank too much and collapsed on the keyboard.
No just joking about &quot;Pass Oust.&quot;.
&quot;Pass Oust&quot; indicates that installed software was removed/dispelled
for an upgrade
&quot;Pass Void&quot; indicates software removed by the System Administrator.

Of course there are some other types of events.
And event logs and the event command
accomplish more than I am revealing.
Please see
# augur help event
because that will be more current and complete.
What I type in an email message becomes obsolete fast.
So please use augur's help to discover what does what.

Please be aware of the changes
so they do not come as an unpleasant shock
when the newer sorcery becomes available.
The new codeword, as part of the version portion of the file name,
is &quot;event&quot; to be in contrast with the current stable and soon to be
historical &quot;kame&quot;
&quot;kame&quot; pronounced &quot;ka&quot; + &quot;meh&quot; is the word turtle in Japanese.
The codeword event is adequate for the newer sorcery,
because the revision of the event logs is the most dominate change.
