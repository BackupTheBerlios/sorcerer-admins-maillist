&gt;<i> just a question.... what will be the result if a spell requiring a newer

</I>
The probability is low, but not nill.
gtk+ usually remains largely binary compatible.
If gtk+ fails to compile
then the SA will be informed of that
through the usual log files.
Even if an autofailure of other spells
that require gtk+ do not happen
the SA should fix spells according to their order.

# echo -e &quot;firefox\ngtk+&quot; | augur order
gtk+
firefox

augur can order a list of spells.

If a spell that requires gtk+, such as firefox,
fails to compile because
the installed gtk+ does not have
the functions that are expected
then that problem would have to be deduced.
One could not automatically assume
that the installed version of gtk+
is too high or too low without first hand examination.

In the distant past there was a compile error involving firefox
that happened only after gtk+ was updated to a newer version.
In that instance firefox failed to compile because
installed gtk+ had been successfully updated.

An autofailure does not necessarily prevent a problem.
In many cases a problem would not occur
other than an autofailure generated problem.

&gt;<i> autofaillure for me is a boon because I know exactly where is the root
</I>&gt;<i> cause.
</I>
An autofailure only tells what triggered the autofailure.
It does not indicate a problem.
Potentially it prevents an SA from encountering problems
that might happen if no autofailure happened
and compilation continued.
If a software project is installed
and an update fails to compile
then in almost all cases other software
that will update will compile fine
using the installed version
of the software project that failed to compile.

An autofailure does not prevent a problem.
It causes a definite problem of autofailure.
In most cases having a spell or two fail
to compile during update would not trash
the entire update if the spells that failed
to compile did not cause an autofailure.

Let us assume that during an update
gtk+ and firefox both failed to compile.
Which would you check first?
I would check gtk+
If firefox was autofailed by gtk+
then the SA has no choice but to
fix gtk+ or clear the failed queue
in order to attempt the compilation of firefox.


&gt;<i> if the spell isn't installed, ok then autofailure remain....
</I>&gt;<i> if the spell is installed but newer version do fails.... with you scenario
</I>&gt;<i> the spells that require it are still casted...
</I>&gt;<i> 1) the spell is API compatible with the old version, then everything shall
</I>&gt;<i> compile....&#160; ok
</I>&gt;<i> 2) the spell require the new api
</I>&gt;<i> 2-1) the configure is updated and detect the wrong version.... ok not so
</I>&gt;<i> much overhead to detect
</I>
Some software explicitly fails and refuses to compile
during the running of ./configure --prefix
when it detects an installed requirement is too old.
Normally that is easy to spot.
The reason is listed in the compile log.

&gt;<i> 2-2) the configure isn't updated and compilation fails in horrible way.....
</I>&gt;<i> might take time to investigate
</I>
Maybe, but in that event
please order the spells to check
and check the spells that come first.

# augur activity failed

The listing of software in the failed log
that is still current at the end is already
in the correct order.
If both gtk+ and firefox failed to compile
then the attempt to compile gtk+ would come first.

&gt;<i> but anyway this shall work....
</I>&gt;<i> however I think that on start of compile log you should add some info lines
</I>&gt;<i> saying what are the requirements, what is the current requirement version
</I>&gt;<i> installed, and what is the lastest requirement version
</I>
That would seriously pump up the size of compile logs.

# augur arof gedit | wc -l
317

At least an additional 300 lines at the start of gedit compile.
And while I can list the installed version for a spell
and also the available version for the spell
I can not add to the compile log header
information about what installed versions
of software are required.
In many situations, especially involving gcc,
I can only tell that newer or older installed software
is required after I have experienced a failed attempt
at compilation.

# ( augur arof gedit | augur available; augur version | sed p ) | sort | uniq -u

If an inconsistency exists
then output from the above command
would show where that inconsistency is.

&gt;<i> example :
</I>&gt;<i> #### requirements info
</I>&gt;<i> requirement&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; current version&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; available version
</I>&gt;<i> gtk&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2.4.0&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2.4.0
</I>&gt;<i> libtool&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 1.5.6&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2.0.0
</I>&gt;<i> #### end requirement info
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;lot of lines&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;horrible death&gt;
</I>
Carefully eyeballing 300 lines is a strain.
If I had to do it
then I would at least pre-parse and color code the lines.

However, I do not dislike the idea.
I would implement it so that only lines
where the current and available version differ.
That way if the lines appear
then it maybe worthy of investigation
instead of carefully examining hundreds of lines.


&gt;<i> like this you know looking at this section that you don't have the lastest
</I>&gt;<i> versions of libtool but you're up to date for gtk and that the compilation
</I>&gt;<i> failure might comes from that....
</I>
Thanks.
It seems like an okay idea.
Nothing directly can be inferred from those lines.
But at least in the scenario of gtk+ firefox compile failure
the SA would see the lines about the difference between
the installed and available versions of gtk+
at the start of the firefox compile log.
If nothing else it acts as a
&quot;you might want to start over there first&quot;
type arrow.

I wrote it in my todo list as:

Check installed and available versions for requirements.
If they differ when a spell starts to compile
then list those differences at the start of a compile log.

Thanks again for the feedback.
Hopefully compile logs will not have the additional lines
and everything will compile just fine.
But if not then I hope the additional lines
will be useful in guiding the SA in checking
software that failed compilation in correct order.
