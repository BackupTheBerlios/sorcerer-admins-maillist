<PRE>Hi!
well here is my point of view (I'm the root cause of this request)
- what is the aim of trying to continue starting a box that will fail? loss
of data?
   I means : a box relying on udev shall not even go further if this service
hasn't started, what might happens if other services try to do things on
/dev/* devices while  theses entries are false? what is the point of trying
to launch anyway the cryptsetup service knowing that it will lock the box if
mdadm service hasn't started?

- what the aim of continue to have a service continue to run if a
requirement exit without notice?
- what the aim of trying to stop a service that hasn't started and print
error lines confusing the SA?

services are dangerous because they can have sides effect much more later
than expected, some bug in a service can have side effect causing possible
loss of data, or un-startable box.... they then require special safety
solution. When you launch you favorite application, you assume that the
whole box is in order to work, NO? I can't make that assumption right now
with current design

regarding speed... I still believe that the overhead isn't that much as kyle
is saying.... what will we loss? 1? 2s? on a netbook? anyway using a &quot;super
service&quot; process written in C/C++ using a client/server model and then only
communication through unix sockets, I'm confident that the cost won't be
ever noticeable...

another point regarding speed :
say you have 5 starting services :
S00_1 : 10s
S00_2 : 50s
S01_3 : require S00_1, 1s
S01_4 : require S00_1, 30s

with current design using parallel start : S00 time : 50s, S01 time : 30s,
whole time 80s
with a start/stop controled on requirements : S01_4 total start (most time
consuming on the S00_1 branch) 10+30s = 40s,  S00_2 total time : 50s, whole
start time 50s......
=&gt; 80s versus 50s, who is winner?

another point regarding speed :
S00_1 : no requirement, might take 3s to fail
S01_2 : require S00_1, might take 40s to fail
S02_3 : require S01_2, might take 1s to fail
imagine now that S00_1 fails, in controled start way, S01_2, S02_3 won't
start and then won't consume resources, won't make the other S01* and S02*
wait (since the are waiting on their branches and not on a runlevel start
step), overall cost of the failure : 3s
now with the current design, S00_1 fails, cost 3s, we're moving to the S01
layer, S01_2 fails (because of S00_1) on integrated time out of 40s, cost :
40s, moving to the S02 layer, S02_3 is started, fail, cost 1s.  OVERALL
start time 3+40+1 = 43s
=&gt; 3s versus 43s.... wo is winner?

controled start service is winner in both failure and success scenario....

from my point of view service can look like the public swimming pool analogy
:<i>
</I>services are childs, fun, fast and running in a non controled manner across
the pool, you can take the assumption that all child behave well and then
just open the pool and let the childes play (this is current sorcerer init)
you don't have any overhead....
in real life, childes collides, some migth dye in the pool.... first try is
the automatic alarm (the red lines in the startup log) but as you might
know, if nobody listen to the alarm..... if you don't look each start/stop
time the logs, you might not notice something is going to be wrong.... it
might work 1 boot, 1 month, 1 year, you don't know....

that's why in all pools there are safety gards, if they see a dangerous
thing they will stop the childs before irremediable damage occurs, they
might also save some child from drawing... if some service aren't started
(say the service &quot;fill the high jump pool with water&quot;) the safety team won't
let the childes access to the high jump service.... because some childes are
clever and won't try to jump and others are dumb or not careful and  will
assume that there is water....

now let look at the case the high jump is open, for some reason, the &quot;fill
the high jump pool with water&quot; trigger an emergency.... the safety team
shall take all the childes using the high jump and ask them to stop using
that service.... in current sorcerer, the childes will continue to jump.....
it might or not work... who knows?

the only way to have the alarm be meaningful is to always have the lines
green.... a red line shall stop the process and ask for fixe.... and at
least prevent users to start....
the only way to have the service not try to jump from the high jump in an
empty pool is the safety team ie that lock controlled startup process....

controlled startup process will have both gain in term of startup speed and
service reliability....

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is no reason why we can't have our cake and eat it too, though.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the Debian world, they have runlevels 2 and 4 as serial init, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; runlevels 3 and 5 for parallel init. We could use  runlevels 2 and 4 for

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; locking everything-will-fail-on-any-error init, and 3 and 5 like we have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That seems bold.
</I>&gt;<i> There was no parallel init-script execution when I used Debian.
</I>&gt;<i> I would not have guessed that they would have decided
</I>&gt;<i> to try to make it default.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Having a serial init is very useful for fine-tuning the boot process,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; though. It is definitely something that should be available, just not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; default.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I only use the serial init-script execution runlevels.
</I>&gt;<i> The chaos is not worth the extra measure of speed.
</I>&gt;<i> When I re-designed init-scripts to be LSB compliant
</I>&gt;<i> by coincidence more than design I realized that
</I>&gt;<i> the introduction of runlevel steps allowed for
</I>&gt;<i> some easy parallel execution of init-scripts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course first attempts at using it turned out sloppy.
</I>&gt;<i> Lines were not being printed entirely at once and therefore
</I>&gt;<i> separate lines from different init-scripts could chop
</I>&gt;<i> each other apart and look weird.
</I>&gt;<i> That aside it worked.
</I>&gt;<i> And the problem with chopped up lines was solved years ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Back in my Debian days,
</I>&gt;<i> debian used init-scripts written in perl.
</I>&gt;<i> I am uncertain if I would describe booting
</I>&gt;<i> as slow or as entertaining.
</I>&gt;<i> However, these days probably both Debian and Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> use the DASH shell for executing most init-scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> DASH is like BASH, but lighter and therefore bit faster to start.
</I>&gt;<i> There are limitations and differences between DASH and BASH.
</I>&gt;<i> And there are differences between Sorcerer and Debian.
</I>&gt;<i> But overall if both distros are sticking to a light alternative
</I>&gt;<i> to running init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> then I expect boot speed should be similar.
</I>&gt;<i> At the runlevels 3 5 Debian will probably boot faster
</I>&gt;<i> just for having reversed definition for those run levels.
</I>&gt;<i> Likweise 2 and 4 will probably be faster for Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet overall I do not have much concern about it.
</I>&gt;<i> Someone can always come up with a faster booting method
</I>&gt;<i> if they are willing to make some sacrifices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Considering how init-scripts during
</I>&gt;<i> sysinit are not executed in parallel
</I>&gt;<i> and how parallel execution of init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> during runlevels can be improved
</I>&gt;<i> I am impelled to say that Sorcerer init design
</I>&gt;<i> is about providing robustness rather than speed.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the decision to not use lockfiles
</I>&gt;<i> during init-script execution
</I>&gt;<i> has become reason for some people
</I>&gt;<i> to conjecture that Sorcerer's init is
</I>&gt;<i> focused upon speed.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet looking at the 40 line script
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/prc
</I>&gt;<i> that controls the execution of init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> during runlevel demonstrates that the Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> design emphasizes simplicity.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps the a more true perspective
</I>&gt;<i> that acknowledges all these facts
</I>&gt;<i> is that Sorcerer's init-design is
</I>&gt;<i> an attempt to make an adequate
</I>&gt;<i> compromise between
</I>&gt;<i> robustness, speed, and simplicity?
</I>&gt;<i> It might lack complexity and control
</I>&gt;<i> it certainly does not lack the ability to boot our boxes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If not for the code for parallel execution of init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> then /etc/init.d/prc could be 25 lines or less
</I>&gt;<i> which makes for much easier reading on a console.
</I>&gt;<i> To me those extra 25 lines are already a compromise
</I>&gt;<i> of simplicity for added speed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps simplicity above all is most important during booting.
</I>&gt;<i> If booting does require debugging
</I>&gt;<i> then not having to have a PhD. in CS
</I>&gt;<i> and a day to look at sources is a greater boon
</I>&gt;<i> than having a wickedly fast C program
</I>&gt;<i> which controls init-script execution
</I>&gt;<i> yet is bugged up while reading
</I>&gt;<i> something unexpected in an init-script.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer SAs are more skilled than an average simian
</I>&gt;<i> but that is no reason why the method of init-script
</I>&gt;<i> execution should be so complex that
</I>&gt;<i> an educated ape could not understand.
</I>&gt;<i> If we monkey around with the init-script execution method
</I>&gt;<i> then we might go bananas trying to figure out
</I>&gt;<i> why it became bugged.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer SAs will be scratching their heads in confusion
</I>&gt;<i> and flinging flaming feces at Sorcerer developers for
</I>&gt;<i> allowing a simple single 40 line BASH script method
</I>&gt;<i> to be replaced by a 2000+ line C program
</I>&gt;<i> and assortment of other shell scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> Emails will read lines such as,
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;It&#8217;s a madhouse! &#8230; a madhouse!&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;You maniacs! You blew it up!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The two lines are movie quotes acted by Charlton Heston,
</I>&gt;<i> died on April 5, 2008.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone in the mood to watch original
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; movies?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I quote old movies in my email jokes,
</I>&gt;<i> and I know I am the only person who thinks it is funny.
</I>&gt;<i> But this time the joke makes a good conjecture
</I>&gt;<i> for the value of simplicity.
