&gt;<i> really interesting concept!

</I>&gt;<i> anyway good news!
</I>
Evert also was not fond
of my choice of naming the new augur command uproot.
But it does seem a good analogy until someone else
comes up with a very good name for it.

dispel -r $SPELL

That would be way too dangerous!
What appears in the dispel queue
when a SA issues:
# augur uproot $SPELL
might contain some surprises
and include more software than the
SA wants to dispel.

A dispel -r $SPELL command
tells dispel to go ahead and do an uproot
without giving the SA any forewarning
about what spells would be dispelled.
Consequently, I created an augur command
that queues spells for removal.

Additionally, the SA might decide to run
# augur uproot $SPELL
# augur uproot $SPELL2

The SA can run the command separately
for multiple spells or run it together...
# augur uproot $SPELL1 $SPELL2 $SPELL3

That way the dispel queue can fill without
dispel running and the SA can start the dispel by invoking:
# dispel
After the SA approves the list of spells that will be removed.



&gt;<i> for the SID how do you manage to have spawned child have there own SID? set
</I>&gt;<i> -m? or another method?
</I>
Spawned children are not normally made session leaders.
Therefore, they inherit the SID of the session leader
which might be their parent or a parent of their parent.
If a spawned child should be a session leader
then it is up to the programmer to make it so.
I can not control that without modifying the
source and recasting the software.

However, I can have init-scripts start new processes
as session leaders by invoking the program by providing
the program name and it's parameters as parameters
to the program setsid.


&gt;<i> I think there are also room of improvement with the requirement menu....
</I>&gt;<i> when I re-installed sorcerer, I had to re-configure every spell... however
</I>&gt;<i> the list was long and after a while I forgot if I already selected this
</I>&gt;<i> requirement or not.... I'm annoyed by this inconsistency, spell A opt B and
</I>&gt;<i> C, spell D opt B and E but at the end when configuring spell D I forgot that
</I>&gt;<i> I previously selected B...
</I>&gt;<i> more if spell A req B and C and spell D opt B and E, I would like to only
</I>&gt;<i> have to opt E because B is &quot;implicitly selected&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the rules would be :
</I>&gt;<i> for SPELL in&#160; ${TO_CONFIGURE}; do
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ALL_REQUIRED_SPELLS += requirements(${SPELL})
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ALL_ALLREADY_SELECTED_OPT += is_optional_installed(${SPELL})
</I>&gt;<i> done
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if [ $(echo &quot;${ALL_REQUIRED_SPELLS} ${ALL_ALLREADY_SELECTED_OPT}&quot; | grep
</I>&gt;<i> ${OPT} ) != &quot;&quot; ];
</I>&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;&#160; autoselect ${OPT}
</I>&gt;<i> else
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; TO_QUERY += ${OPT}
</I>&gt;<i> fi
</I>&gt;<i> TO_QUERY=$(echo ${TO_QUERY} | sort | uniq)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SELECTED_OPT = display_all_OPT_of_all_spells_menu(${TO_QUERY})
</I>&gt;<i> save_selected_opt_into_conf_file(${SELECTED_OPT})
</I>&gt;<i> cast ${SELECTED_OPT}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> like this you can configure all the spells at once, avoiding
</I>&gt;<i> inconsistencies....
</I>&gt;<i> now say you dispel a spell A that REQ B is dispelled. let say that spell C
</I>&gt;<i> has OPT B autoselected because of A, now that A isn't anymore, B is likely
</I>&gt;<i> to be dispelled. But this won't until B is casted again (say during an
</I>&gt;<i> update) or if a reconfiguration/clean is requested
</I>&gt;<i> now there is also a possibility of autoclean of the box. any spell that
</I>&gt;<i> isn't in the SELECTED_OPT (that contain also the list of spell that are
</I>&gt;<i> casted by the user) and that isn't required isn't wanted to be installed...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> what do you think about this?
</I>
I am not that fond of it.
For example...
I like console only aumix.
I do not like gtk+ aumix.
However, for most other programs
I would not mind using gtk+ as an optional.

I can however improve the probability of
the configure menus providing default choices
for optional requirements that are consistent
for what was selected for other spells.

Additionally,
you might want to check out the
# augur always $SPELL
command.
More information about it is provided by invoking
# augur help always

At the moment I do not want to change
selection of optionals to only permit global changes
instead of allowing optionals to be selected/rejected
on a spell by spell basis.
But I can work towards  implementing
a better compromise between the two.
