the future, but for now, I am just getting used to the new way of

</I>&gt;<i> Tue 07 Sep 2010 11:14:47 PM MST &#160;linux &#160;2.6.34.6 &#160;Yore &#160;Cast New
</I>&gt;<i> Sun 12 Sep 2010 09:20:29 AM MST &#160;linux &#160;2.6.35.4 &#160;Yore &#160;Pass Oust
</I>&gt;<i> Sun 12 Sep 2010 09:29:19 AM MST &#160;linux &#160;2.6.35.4 &#160;Fore &#160;Pass Cast
</I>&gt;<i> Thu 07 Oct 2010 09:05:12 PM MST &#160;linux &#160;2.6.35.7 &#160;Fore &#160;Cast New
</I>&gt;<i> Thu 07 Oct 2010 10:36:08 PM MST &#160;linux &#160;2.6.35.7 &#160;Fore &#160;Pass Load
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment linux is casting on this box.
</I>&gt;<i> The 3 most recent events are Fore events.
</I>&gt;<i> linux previously cast on 2010-09-12.
</I>&gt;<i> So that is a Fore Pass Cast
</I>&gt;<i> linux was entered into the cast queue for an update on 2010-10-07.
</I>&gt;<i> That is Fore Cast New
</I>&gt;<i> linux source was downloaded 2010-10-07
</I>&gt;<i> So that is a Fore Past Load.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just by looking at the current sequence of events
</I>&gt;<i> we can guess that with good probability that
</I>&gt;<i> linux is currently installed at version 2.6.35.4
</I>&gt;<i> a newer version 2.6.35.7 entered into the cast queue recently
</I>&gt;<i> and was downloaded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, the events are not so complicated as to indicate
</I>&gt;<i> that linux is currently casting or currently in the cast queue.
</I>&gt;<i> However, most likely the next event for linux will either be
</I>&gt;<i> Fore Pass Oust
</I>&gt;<i> followed by
</I>&gt;<i> Fore Pass Cast
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> Fore Fail Cast
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Either of those outcomes can turn previous events from Fore to Yore.
</I>&gt;<i> Events that remain on the list with a status of Yore indicate that an event
</I>&gt;<i> previously happened, but is not expected to be the current state of the spell.
</I>&gt;<i> In this fashion the event logs can preserve a history
</I>&gt;<i> for events that have happened for spells
</I>&gt;<i> while at the same time helping the SA discern
</I>&gt;<i> which events represent the current expected state of a spell.

</I>&gt;<i> &#160;# augur event kdelibs-v4
</I>&gt;<i> Sat 04 Sep 2010 02:56:20 AM MST &#160;kdelibs-v4 &#160;4.5.1 &#160;Yore &#160;Cast New
</I>&gt;<i> Sat 04 Sep 2010 12:23:52 PM MST &#160;kdelibs-v4 &#160;4.5.1 &#160;Yore &#160;Pass Oust

</I>&gt;<i> Fri 24 Sep 2010 02:32:50 PM MST &#160;kdelibs-v4 &#160;4.5.1 &#160;Yore &#160;Miss ELF
</I>&gt;<i> Sat 25 Sep 2010 04:37:43 PM MST &#160;kdelibs-v4 &#160;4.5.1 &#160;Yore &#160;Pass Oust
</I>&gt;<i> Sat 25 Sep 2010 04:41:45 PM MST &#160;kdelibs-v4 &#160;4.5.1 &#160;Fore &#160;Pass Cast
</I>&gt;<i> Thu 07 Oct 2010 09:05:11 PM MST &#160;kdelibs-v4 &#160;4.5.2 &#160;Fore &#160;Cast New
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like a new kdelibs-v4 is queued for casting.
</I>&gt;<i> I already checked it on my workstation rather than the
</I>&gt;<i> nearly always busy test box.
</I>&gt;<i> However, on the test box it looks a bit like this.
</I>&gt;<i> This also shows a slight problem with event logs
</I>&gt;<i> that I might have already fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> Notice that a Yore Cast ELF and Yore Miss ELF
</I>&gt;<i> occur at the same time, but the event that should
</I>&gt;<i> have happened first is Miss ELF.
</I>&gt;<i> An ELF was missing, therefore the spell entered into
</I>&gt;<i> the cast queue as a Cast reason ELF
</I>&gt;<i> As we can see it there was quite some time before it compiled,
</I>&gt;<i> but eventually a Pass Oust happens and then a few minutes later
</I>&gt;<i> the newer version is installed and that is logged as a Pass Cast event.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From the current events about kdelibs-v4 we
</I>&gt;<i> can guess that kdelibs-v4 version 4.5.1 is installed
</I>&gt;<i> and that kdelibs-v4 for version 4.5.2 entered into the cast queue
</I>&gt;<i> for the reason of being selected during a
</I>&gt;<i> # augur newer
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, there is no download event for it,
</I>&gt;<i> because I copied the xz compressed source tarballs
</I>&gt;<i> from my workstation to the test box. &#160;:)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, the event logs do not indicate why
</I>&gt;<i> the KDE software team again did not include kdepim software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now for one last example
</I>&gt;<i> jump down to the end of this email.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> According to augur help event, 'Pass Oust' means software removed for upgrade

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is the 'Yore/Fore' telling me?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Jan
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The last two events from the above event log indicate that
</I>&gt;<i> initramfs was uninstalled for reason of update.
</I>&gt;<i> That was once a Fore event, but is now a Yore event.
</I>&gt;<i> It is Yore because 7 seconds later initramfs was installed.
</I>&gt;<i> A Fore Pass Cast event will change all previous Fore Pass Oust
</I>&gt;<i> events for a spell to Yore Pass Oust.
</I>&gt;<i> That makes sense because software is not expected
</I>&gt;<i> to be both concurrently installed while not installed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Simply by selecting only Fore events from an event summary
</I>&gt;<i> then the SA can immediately gather more information about
</I>&gt;<i> the expected state for a spell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # augur event linux | sed -n &quot;s:Fore &#160;::p&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Sun 12 Sep 2010 09:29:19 AM MST &#160;linux &#160;2.6.35.4 &#160;Pass Cast
</I>&gt;<i> Thu 07 Oct 2010 09:05:12 PM MST &#160;linux &#160;2.6.35.7 &#160;Cast New
</I>&gt;<i> Thu 07 Oct 2010 10:36:08 PM MST &#160;linux &#160;2.6.35.7 &#160;Pass Load
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also in an event summary Yore events tend to come before Fore events.
</I>&gt;<i> This is very obvious when viewing an event summary about a single spell.
</I>&gt;<i> However, when viewing an event summary for an amount of days:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # augur event 1 | wc -l
</I>&gt;<i> 124
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We find that visually this is much harder to recognize because
</I>&gt;<i> the events will be ordered chronologically instead of by spell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # augur event 1 | sed -n &quot;s:Fore &#160;::p&quot; | wc -l
</I>&gt;<i> 81
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, examination of only Fore events
</I>&gt;<i> might be a bit faster, sometimes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # augur event 30 | wc -l; augur event 30 | sed -n &quot;s:Fore &#160;::p&quot; | wc -l
</I>&gt;<i> 3590
</I>&gt;<i> 1354
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looking at events over a 30 day span
</I>&gt;<i> eliminating Yore events from consideration
</I>&gt;<i> could reduce the amount of events for consideration by half or more.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it will not lower one's automobile insurance rates.
</I>&gt;<i> :)
</I>&gt;<i> But there is one other interesting aspect about events.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I have not decided how to display the information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some event logs will not be empty such as:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fail Auto
</I>&gt;<i> Miss ELF
</I>&gt;<i> Miss LA
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They might contain more information that tells
</I>&gt;<i> exactly why an auto failure happened or why
</I>&gt;<i> installed software failed the ELF or LA checks.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, the extra information does not fit good into a column table.
</I>&gt;<i> I am thinking about adding that extra information
</I>&gt;<i> to the output of:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # augur event $SPELL
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So that it is displayed for Fore events when available
</I>&gt;<i> but only when event information is desired about a single spell.
</I>&gt;<i> When I see that a spell did not install as expected
</I>&gt;<i> then I tend to do a
</I>&gt;<i> # augur event spell
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I see &quot;Fail Auto&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> then I tend to cat the event log to find the exact reason.
</I>&gt;<i> It is a bit manual.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This week I am testing changes to cast that
</I>&gt;<i> should fix the mode of /tmp if some software changed
</I>&gt;<i> the mode of /tmp during compilation or installation.
</I>&gt;<i> It is too annoying when software does that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My hope for event logs is to be able to provide information
</I>&gt;<i> about the most common events on a box in an output that
</I>&gt;<i> has a clean appearance and is fast to visually parse or to
</I>&gt;<i> dissect using sed, grep, perl or any such program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, the terms for events used are a bit cryptic.
</I>&gt;<i> They are actual English words.
</I>&gt;<i> Words like Oust, Yore, and Fore have valid meanings
</I>&gt;<i> that are congruent with their use by sorcery.
</I>&gt;<i> But those words also do not commonly occur in modern spoken English.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, they could add a tiny element of confusion that makes
</I>&gt;<i> the output of events look like colorful but useless play-dough.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, after misunderstandings are spot and fixed
</I>&gt;<i> then the output from event logs will make sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, the output for event log summary
</I>&gt;<i> is not that much different than output for activity logs.
</I>&gt;<i> The same sort of information is there and more.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the information has not already been segregated
</I>&gt;<i> according to whether an event was a Pass, Fail, or Load event.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By using:
</I>&gt;<i> # augur activity {fail,load,pass}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the SA can have the event information displayed
</I>&gt;<i> segregated according to those types of events.
</I>&gt;<i> However, a SA could also segregate the information
</I>&gt;<i> from the output out # augur event
</I>&gt;<i> by using
</I>&gt;<i> # augur event 3650 | sed ....
</I>&gt;<i> where the sed command chews the information
</I>&gt;<i> and regurgitates the desired lines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current event system is in response to many SA requests.
</I>&gt;<i> Some SAs wanted all the information to appear in a single file
</I>&gt;<i> instead of having 3 separate files for activity logs.
</I>&gt;<i> Others want sorcery events added to the system log,
</I>&gt;<i> which is already has almost everything in it anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> And I wanted an event system that preserves event history
</I>&gt;<i> while at the same time making clear which events are expected
</I>&gt;<i> to be history and which events are expected to be current.
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, this goes a bit beyond what can be easily done
</I>&gt;<i> using a single file and is impossible to accomplish using the system log.
</I>&gt;<i> However, as a compromise I decided upon very terse simple names
</I>&gt;<i> to use for events and added some nice color coding to the tables.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So nobody receives exactly what they want:
</I>&gt;<i> no system log entries;no segregated activity logs.
</I>&gt;<i> However, event logs have many boons such as:
</I>&gt;<i> require very little disk space;
</I>&gt;<i> store historical information;
</I>&gt;<i> discern current information;
</I>&gt;<i> have tiny logical names like &quot;Fail Cast&quot; instead of &quot;Compile Failure&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> can provide information output in columns;
</I>&gt;<i> can provide tables of color coded information;
</I>&gt;<i> and can be viewed in interesting ways using the ls command
</I>&gt;<i> directly on /var/log/sorcery/event/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the most compelling reasons for the overhaul of event logs
</I>&gt;<i> was Evert's request that more lines be used in # augur scry
</I>&gt;<i> to provide information about recent events.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I did not want events to be displayed on those lines
</I>&gt;<i> for which the event is no longer current.
</I>&gt;<i> This makes sense to me.
</I>&gt;<i> This way a Fail Cast or Miss ELF event
</I>&gt;<i> shown on # augur scry immediately vanishes
</I>&gt;<i> when the spell has a Pass Cast event.
</I>&gt;<i> SAs will not end up chasing after an
</I>&gt;<i> error or problem which has already vanished.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I again added information not relevant to the question being asked.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it does go to show that the event logs changed
</I>&gt;<i> according to SA requests.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, if the current method for event logs
</I>&gt;<i> is not pleasing or inadequate
</I>&gt;<i> then it would probably change again according to SA requests.
