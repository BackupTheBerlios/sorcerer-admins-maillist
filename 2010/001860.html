<PRE>Jean-luc Mallet preference seems to be for a combination
of control and speed which are normally exclusive pursuits.

Consider the world of racing cars.
A spoiler can provide greater downward force and thus
increase tire traction and therefore increase control.
However, a spoiler that creates greater sink also creates
a greater amount of parasitic drag and the increased
parasitic drag reduces both acceleration and top speed.

Are computers that much different?
Can both greater control and greater speed can achieved?
As I conjecture this I felt inclined to look at the manual page for gcc:

&quot;
-ffast-math
 Sets -fno-math-errno, -funsafe-math-optimizations,
 -ffinite-math-only, -fno-rounding-math, -fno-signaling-nans and
 -fcx-limited-range.

This option causes the preprocessor macro
&quot;__FAST_MATH__&quot; to be defined.

This option is not turned on by any -O option since it can result
in incorrect output for programs which depend on an exact
implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for math
functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs that do
not require the guarantees of these specifications.&quot;

Apparently, even with computers
compromises are made that favor
either speed or control, but not both.


Evert makes some interesting points about PID files.
But what can we deduce about the status of a box
by examining a PID or a PID file?
Much discussion has involved udev,
because of udev's obvious importance on a box.
So let us stick with that example.

udevd does not have a PID file.
However, when it runs it does have a PID
Usually it has between 1 and 3 PIDs.
The presence of a PID for udev indicates only one thing.
the PID indicates that the daemon is running
and probably listening for hotplug events.
Just because udev is running is not by itself
proof that the nodes contained or not contained in /dev
are usable, correct, or complete.

Most of the device nodes in /dev are created
by a cooperation of a running udevd and the
invocation of udevadm trigger
This causes a replay of cold plug events
that udev handles by loading modules,
loading firmware, and creating device nodes in /dev
according to installed udev rule files.
udevadm, although it provides a service,
does not remain running like a daemon.
Whether the device nodes are created correctly
used to depend almost entirely upon udev rules,
but now that /dev is devtmpfs instead of just tmpfs
it has a greater probability of containing necessary
device nodes even if udev rule files are incorrect or missing.

The reason I am explaining the complexity of udev
is to make the assertion that the mere presence of
a PID or a PID file does not indicate that the content
of /dev is proper or complete.
Whether /dev is usable might not be known
until a fsck of filesystems
or a mount of of filesystems is attempted.

I would go as far as to conjecture that knowing
if udev failed at the proper creation of /dev
might not be assumable by checking the presence of
device nodes in /dev/ for the devices defined by filesystems in /etc/fstab
No lockfile, no PID file, and no PID can indicate
if /dev/ is complete and usable.

That is why I created the kernel command line parameter &quot;coldplug&quot;
If the SA suspects that the problem is udev related
then udev can be circumvented with that command line parameter.
A previously saved order list of modules can be loaded
while a previously saved /dev/ is copied to /dev/
In many situations that would be enough to
circumvent a problem with udev
and allow a box to continue booting.
Unfortunately, I have not decided exactly what
should be checked in order to activate
the coldplug safeguard automatically.

As I stated several times before
the menu that allows SAs to select
a root partition when a root partition
is not specified in /etc/fstab
is an example of the precise application
of control to bring about a desirable outcome
that enhances robustness of booting.

Control should be added when the potential
outcome increases robustness.
However, the gain depends upon correctly
anticipating and intercepting specific problems.
Adding a control which treats
the red failure text of all init-scripts exactly the same
is not the anticipation and interception of a specific problem.

If a more robust boot is desirable
then we should focus upon:
identifying where problems will occur;
why the problem occurs;
and what can be done about a problem,
before the problem gathers mass like a snowball rolling down hill.

Spotting and solving problems with
pin point precision will prevent pain.
SAs do not want booting to interrupt
or omit the execution of important init-scripts
which turns into a nightmarish Easter egg hunt.
They want to boot up, log in, and review log files and log out.

In the recent past,
Evert made a suggestion for the Install/Rescue disk
to present a menu while booting that will allow
the SA to select a device to mount for the root
instead of the I/Rs initramfs.
And the menu does other neat things also.
I forgot exactly what it can do.
But it is nice that is there
in case I want to use it to do that.

Thinking that a menu like that would be useful
is a good example of preemptive thinking.
Evert anticipated some problems that could happen
and decided that an init-script could provide an adequate solution.
Even more than that,
that init-script demonstrates the nearly untapped potential
init-scripts have for being able to accomplish
more than the 3 simple tasks of mounting virtual filesystems,
loading modules, and running daemons.

If control is added in the form of init-scripts
then potentially beneficial outcomes can be created
where the potential for keeping a boot on target
would be commensurate with the added overhead.

The collection of init-scripts Sorcerer currently uses
can be described as fire-and-forget.
Successful outcomes are assumed.
Provided that a Sorcerer box is not too far from the norm
then the box will successfully boot even if the logs
contain a line or two of red marks.
Obviously, booting could benefit from a bit of additional control.
Yet, how that control is added will determine
if the control is beneficial or detrimental.

Rather that creating a generic method for control that
automatically snowballs errors
into avalanches of init-scripts that are not executed
why not implement tiny specific methods for control
that nudge booting back onto track when
something undesirable happens?
The goal should be to have an outcome where the
box boots and the real root filesystem mounts.
Should not methods of control be designed
with that goal firmly in mind?
