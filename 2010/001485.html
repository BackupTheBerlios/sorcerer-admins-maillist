Good idea.

Probably for some software authors the concept
of menus and icons does not breach their brain.
If not mentioned on the email list I also would give it no consideration.

Yes Sorcerer was around then
when every desktop environment
used some different format/name file for menu entries and icons.
And a box that had both gnome and KDE
installed concurrently was rare.
Many distributions focused on providing gnome or KDE,
but not both.
RedHat was in the gnome faction.
Mandrake was offering a RPM Redhat like distro with KDE
instead of gnome.
Debian maintainers were fuming over Trolltech's Q Public License,
and therefore not creating official debs for qt nor KDE.
But these days gnome and KDE are not so different
in what they provide.
Perhaps more than icons and menu entries
will become standardized among them?

While /usr/share/applications/
is strange path name for POSIX/UNIX
for being long and non-abbreviated;
the concept of selecting a unified format
and location for desktop entries makes sense.

However, to digress again for a moment...
I wonder if Sorcerer was rare during the early days
for not exclusively providing gnome or KDE?
Perhaps just a little bit more progressive?
