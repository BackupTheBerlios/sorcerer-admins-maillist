<PRE>Agreed, this newer method does make sense.

As a person who does a lot of re-compiles of the software on my box, I run
into problems much earlier than someone who just updates spells and do not
check the knock-on effect it has on other spells in the system.

In the end I do not stop re-compiling until I have all the spells on my
system recompile fine without failures, so it might be beneficial to see all
the failing spells on the first round.

What happens now is that one spell might typically fail quite a few other
spells. That spell gets fixed and with augur retry the other spells are
added back in the queue. This method has some drawbacks, but is a lot better
than before augur retry existed.

Back to reconfiguring spells...
I do understand the point about cast not taking any switches.

how about:
augur reconfigure $SPELL?

The main problem with augur forget for me is that it does two things..

It forgets the config of a spell, and also reconfigures any spell that
depended on the spell in question.

What if I just wanted to change the config of the spell, but was happy with
the configs of the later spells?

Also, if I dispel a spell that is optionally required by another spell, why
do I have to call augur forget $SPELL? This should be standard behaviour for
dispel..

ie:

I want to reconfigure a spell

augur reconfigure $SPELL

I want to get rid of a spell...
augur dispel --unsafe $SPELL

Now, that spell was optionally required by another spell... that other spell
MUST reconfigure.
If the spell that was dispelled was a hard requirement, it gets restored.


See what I mean?

&gt;<i> Parameter -r on cast has unpredictable results
</I>&gt;<i> depending upon what ends up in the cast queue.
</I>&gt;<i> It could reconfigure much more than the
</I>&gt;<i> spells listed as command line parameters.
</I>&gt;<i> That is why the # augur forget $SPELL
</I>&gt;<i> was created.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Somehow I was expecting much more was required
</I>&gt;<i> in order to cast linux-custom.
</I>&gt;<i> I had expected that I removed the
</I>&gt;<i> make menuconfig from the spell.
</I>&gt;<i> But however it is now it has been mostly
</I>&gt;<i> untouched since it moved to the new name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having multiple behaviors relation to autofailure of spells
</I>&gt;<i> makes helping SAs more difficult because they will
</I>&gt;<i> probably not describe exactly what is ongoing.
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually, such decisions usually go the route
</I>&gt;<i> of entirely one direction.
</I>&gt;<i> For example the only rule used for config files
</I>&gt;<i> is the preservation rule and not the backup rule.
</I>&gt;<i> Modified configuration files are preserved in /etc/
</I>&gt;<i> while fresh new default configuration files
</I>&gt;<i> are stored in /etc.ori/
</I>&gt;<i> That compromise obtains a bit of the best about both choices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Autofailure would definitely have one default behavior,
</I>&gt;<i> but it probably should not have more than behavior.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a software project is not installed
</I>&gt;<i> then the most probable behavior is that
</I>&gt;<i> any software to compile that requires the
</I>&gt;<i> missing required software project will fail to compile.
</I>&gt;<i> However if a software project fails to compile
</I>&gt;<i> but is already installed
</I>&gt;<i> then software that requires it will probably
</I>&gt;<i> be able to compile using the older than current version.
</I>&gt;<i> This enables important security updates to happen
</I>&gt;<i> where our current autofail rule might prevent anywhere
</I>&gt;<i> from a small to a large selection of software
</I>&gt;<i> from being compiled.
</I>&gt;<i> Naturally, SAs should be ontop of the situation when
</I>&gt;<i> something fails to compile.
</I>&gt;<i> But perhaps Sorcerer should try to achieve
</I>&gt;<i> best results for the SAs that have their boxes
</I>&gt;<i> mostly on autopilot?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let us count that above as 2 boons for the new method.
</I>&gt;<i> In general more software will compile
</I>&gt;<i> with a lesser probability of security updates being blocked.
</I>&gt;<i> So what convenience do we sacrifice
</I>&gt;<i> by switching to the new rule?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All I can think of is that some software might fail to compile
</I>&gt;<i> and some might compile twice.
</I>&gt;<i> Once before the a failed spell is fixed
</I>&gt;<i> and once again after a failed spell is fixed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand let us consider....
</I>&gt;<i> What if a SA sets a box to update
</I>&gt;<i> and there are 90 spells queued.
</I>&gt;<i> By the current rule if a compile failure happens
</I>&gt;<i> then the SA might return a few hours later
</I>&gt;<i> and have 60 autofailed spells.
</I>&gt;<i> There is a significant loss of potential CPU cycles
</I>&gt;<i> and after fixing the failed spell the SA will
</I>&gt;<i> have to wait for 60 spells to compile.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we change to the new rule
</I>&gt;<i> and a failure happens during updating
</I>&gt;<i> then when the SA returns the box might
</I>&gt;<i> have only 1 spell in the failed queue.
</I>&gt;<i> Since that spell is already installed
</I>&gt;<i> it did not cause an autofailure for the
</I>&gt;<i> other spells waiting to cast.
</I>&gt;<i> The SA fixes the one spell, recompiles
</I>&gt;<i> and the box is probably done updating.
</I>&gt;<i> That seems less problematic
</I>&gt;<i> and more efficient for the SA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current autofail rule applies to both
</I>&gt;<i> new deployments and to updates.
</I>&gt;<i> However most boxes do 1 deployment
</I>&gt;<i> and hundreds of updates.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, a new autofail rule is
</I>&gt;<i> more favorable for updates and therefore
</I>&gt;<i> that should grant it a 3rd boon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So new rule boons:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. more software compiles makes for better updating
</I>&gt;<i> 2. less chance of security fixes being prevented from compilation
</I>&gt;<i> 3. more efficient for the SA that makes a general time estimate
</I>&gt;<i> for all spells queued instead of watching augur scry like a hawk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only time where the current autofail rule
</I>&gt;<i> is best suited is during initial deployment.
</I>&gt;<i> However, during initial deployment software
</I>&gt;<i> that fails compilation is also software which is not installed.
</I>&gt;<i> And therefore, a failed spell would cause
</I>&gt;<i> a cascade of autofailures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, in my opinion the proposed modification
</I>&gt;<i> to the autofailure rule provides for the type of handling
</I>&gt;<i> that we would prefer both during initial deployment
</I>&gt;<i> and during updating.
</I>&gt;<i> And while it is not a perfect rule it sacrifices
</I>&gt;<i> the assumption of failure for convenience provided
</I>&gt;<i> by attempting to continue updating software
</I>&gt;<i> which in retrospect usually works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some combinations of libraries and executables
</I>&gt;<i> have a tight fit.
</I>&gt;<i> openssl and openssh are a good example.
</I>&gt;<i> openssh will usually only run when at runtime
</I>&gt;<i> it can find the same version of openssl that
</I>&gt;<i> was used to compile openssh.
</I>&gt;<i> Software such as libfwbuilder and fwbuilder
</I>&gt;<i> have the same point of origin and are
</I>&gt;<i> effectively the same software project split
</I>&gt;<i> into separate sources.
</I>&gt;<i> The situations where a precise version of a library
</I>&gt;<i> is required are not only few,
</I>&gt;<i> but they also have a very limited area of collateral damage.
</I>&gt;<i> When it happens maybe only 1 to 3 other software
</I>&gt;<i> projects would be effected and refuse to compile.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now let us consider an example containing zlib.
</I>&gt;<i> Potentially zlib could fail to compile.
</I>&gt;<i> However, zlib version 1.2.3 is safe to use if installed.
</I>&gt;<i> But by the current rule, if zlib fails to compile
</I>&gt;<i> then that could potentially autofail:
</I>&gt;<i> # augur aron zlib | wc -l
</I>&gt;<i> 2706
</I>&gt;<i> other spells.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So unless SAs are going to ardently attend updates
</I>&gt;<i> then the current autofailure rule could cause more
</I>&gt;<i> pain than pleasure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not against entirely removing the autofail rule,
</I>&gt;<i> but this compromise to the rule should provide
</I>&gt;<i> instances of autofailure that are better suited
</I>&gt;<i> overall towards maintaining the security of boxes
</I>&gt;<i> where SAs are not actively monitoring updates.
</I>&gt;<i> And for SAs fixing failures
</I>&gt;<i> the modified rules should further minimize what
</I>&gt;<i> ends up in the failed queue and thus
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps save the SA from waiting as much
</I>&gt;<i> and not knowing when to check for results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unless anyone can make a good reason to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain the old rule as a possible selection
</I>&gt;<i> then I recommend SAs that want to use the old rule
</I>&gt;<i> should add a function for it in /etc/sorcery/local.config
</I>&gt;<i> That way they do not have to agree with me
</I>&gt;<i> in order to have it their way.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> The function to replace is called auto_fail()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the modified rule turns out to be a pain
</I>&gt;<i> then we can go back to the old rule
</I>&gt;<i> after a few months of trying it out.
</I>&gt;<i> I am already feeling happier.
</I>&gt;<i> Being the one who tests more updates/
</I>&gt;<i> new versions of software than anyone else
</I>&gt;<i> I will be pleased to not have 60 spells ejected
</I>&gt;<i> from the cast queue because one spell failed to compile.
</I>&gt;<i> This change should help expedite
</I>&gt;<i> checking/fixing of spells with new versions of software.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; To be frank about it,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I am not a fan of autofailure.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Half, the time I remove the spell from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the failed queue that is causing the autofailure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; move the other spells that were autofailed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; back into the cast queue.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I take those steps to nullify the autofailure.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Sometimes autofailure is a convenience.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It might keep a SA chasing after an error
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that is caused by a spell that failed before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the one they are examining.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; However, more often auto failure is an inconvenience.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; On some boxes where SAs are not paying attention
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to autofailed spells the auto fail method might be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; preventing the important updates of installed software
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and therefore permitting some versions of software
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with known security vulnerabilities to remain installed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I have half a mind to rewrite the rule so that....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; A spell can autofail only if it failed to compile
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and an older version of the spell is not already installed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; That way if gtk+ fails compilation and gtk+ is not installed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; then gtk+ will cause autofailures.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; However, if gtk+ fails compilation and gtk+ is installed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; then spells that have gtk+ as part of their requirement chains
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; will not autofail and instead will attempt to cast
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; if they are in the cast queue already.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Would anyone object to me changing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the autofail rules so that they work that way?
