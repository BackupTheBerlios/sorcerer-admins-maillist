<PRE>Games work.
Even games in wine work.
With Sorcerer IA32 installed in /opt/ia32/
then wine runs fine chrooting, provided:
the directories to ELF32 libraries are in /etc/ld.so.conf;
/lib/ld-linux.so.2 is a symbolic link to /opt/ia32/lib/ld-linux.so.2;
and PATH includes /opt/ia32/usr/bin.
Why might someone want to install and boot Sorcerer IA32 exclusively
if the box can run Sorcerer x86_64?

However, because linux began on 80386 for 32-bit machines,
because there is some pre-compiled software for linux 80386,
and because there is plenty of pre-compiled win32 software to run in wine
then the continuation of Sorcerer IA32 seems a necessary compliment to
Sorcerer x86_64.

However, the zero-install injector team might also have a solution.
I have not tried the software, but have long been fond of the concept.
They provide a method for installing from packages pre-compiled software
within a user's home directory for nearly immediate use.
It is similar to what I originally wanted for sorcery,
which was a tool for source based administration
on an installation of Debian.
That was back before I rolled the first bootable Sorcerer Install/Rescue disks.

Alternately, those who want to run a few win32 apps
could use a virtual machine emulator
for installing a Microsoft operating system.
Of course, that is a Faustian deal,
but then again most people pay the Microsoft tax
when purchasing a new laptop
even when they decline the EULA
and wipe the fixed disk clean.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Not everyone would understand the value of keeping an IA32
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> installation in /opt/ia32.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And yes, doing so is completely optional.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However, it is useful for running win32 applications in wine
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or any pre-compiled commercial software that requires ELF32 libraries.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Some software a SA will have to chroot into /opt/ia32/ to run
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> as I did when testing the ELF32 vs ELF64 firefox with macromedia flash plugin.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However, some ELF32 software can be run directly without chrooting
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and it will run because the directories holding ELF32 libraries
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are also included in /etc/ld.so.conf
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and therefore indexed in /etc/ld.so.cache
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The reason I was testing firefox was for Evert,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> who wants flashplugin to work to work with x86_64 firefox.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And the results are that flashplugin works just as good or just as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lousy in both.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The x86_64 box has nearly the same software available for installation
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with less than a 1% difference as compared to IA32.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Software tends to work equally good in both installations.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So SAs are welcome to run either one.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In summary no need to run out and buy new boxes to run Sorcerer on.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> IA32 support is not going away.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However, the lowest architecture supported with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the next set of Install/Rescue images
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will be the i686 architecture.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Initially I wanted 3 Install/Rescue images.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> x86_64 which is SMP,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ia32-SMP which is SMP
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ia32-UP which has a non SMP and non PAE enabled kernel.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The reason for IA32-UP is most useful only for the pentium-M
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> microprocessor which was the only microprocessor of the i686
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> generation that lacked PAE instructions.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Currently, I am waffling about whether I want to create and provide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Does anyone want to admit running Sorcerer on a pentium-m?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If not then I might choose not to provide an IA32 UP-non-PAE
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Install/Rescue image
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> um... I have a small farm ( a pile, actually) of old K62-350's and 450's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (And some 386DX-33/50/66's too). Personally, I would rather see you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support the archaic machines while moving forward w/full steam on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> x86_64, at the expense of the middle option and not looking back. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kinda see that as visionary.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I mean, it's not like they've made 32 bit machines for years now anyway,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and like you point out, most everything now doesn't require a multi-lib.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, I've been relatively happy (um... that means no crashes)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the w/64 bit flash plugin, my Java works fine (even javaws), and screw
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Adobe, coz I typically use Okular Krita, or XPDF instead of reader anyway.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For those times when I must have Dreamweaver, Flash, or Quickbooks, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proudly proclaim my VirtualBox guest installation of Wyndoze 7 64.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sadly, but also fortunately there aren't more apps in this category, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> miss my Skype - for everything else I have my own OpenFire XMPP server
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> w/plugins for just about everything, and I 'think' I can even get skype
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back up and functional via my jabber client(s) via an Asterisk plugin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for Openfire, but for the time being, I just use Skype for chatting in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> VirtualBox under wyndoze and call forward everything through my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GoogleVoice or Asterisk servers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As far as your take on the performance benchmarks of Sorcerer x86_64
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over that of IA32, well, I'm both impressed with the granularity of your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comparisons (always a pleasure to read your take on things), and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disappointed that you aren't realizing about a third improvement over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many aspects of a 32 bit Sorcerer system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Eric Hamileers and Robby Workman had to work on Patrick for a while, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when they presented some benchmarks of Slamd64 and some of their own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ports, they finally sold Pat on the notion of a pure Slackware64.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMNSHO, most of us can live w/o much of the legacy stuff which is going
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to come around anyway shortly, and bridge the gaps w/virtual machines
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for convenience-sake.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But going back to those old boxes, I would like to see you continue to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support them - and not just because I'm one of those idiots that fires
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up 64K IBM 5150's, 3270_AT's, Commodore64's, Trash-80's, and Timex
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sinclairs to prove I still can (I have an ample supply of 8bit ISA NICs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too, for the years to come) - but because many old Pentiums, 486's, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even 386's have utility and can fill niches.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Okay Johnny - Flame on! ;)
