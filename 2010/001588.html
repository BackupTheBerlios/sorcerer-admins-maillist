<PRE>minileech might be broke.
I have not used it in years.
It was a SA request thing.

As for protocols...
That was broke.
It was broke because IANA changed the filename
and download location for that file.
We found out the hard way.
Fortunately, boxes did not end up with
an empty /etc/protocols file
I already fixed the scripts that download from IANA
and roll the monthly services and protocols tarballs.
It really is not a problem with xz otherwise
services would not have updated also since
that is provided as a .tar.xz
and sorcery would not update also since
that is provided as a .tar.xz

I might be wrong since I have done only limited testing.
However, xz seems as stable as gzip
and at the moment far more reliable a library than zlib
Consequently, we are still staying with zlib version 1.2.3
until the bugs are worked out of zlib version 1.2.5

</I>
I am searching and re-testing the code now
to see if there is a problem with translating provides
during spell indexing.
