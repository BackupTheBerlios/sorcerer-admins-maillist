These days I would probably prefer the convenience
of a modular kernel over a percent or two of speed.
Besides after years of boycotting USB,
I finally have some USB devices.
I do not know if hotplugging works as good
without udev and modules.
It might.

</I>
Well, to clarify the meaning, I have no boxes deployed
with a monolthic kernel and therefore I do not test that configuration.
The last bug I remember someone spotting and fixing
had something to do with /dev,
because the install /dev was being used too soon
before the udev populated /dev was made available.
Jan was the person who discovered the problem,
reported it, and recommended a fix.
If I remember correctly, which is iffy at best,
the problem did not effect boxes that booted
using linux-modular and initramfs
There was almost no chance that I would have spotted the problem.
Therefore, if there are problems that effect
the monolthic linux installation
then I will probably not be the first person to spot those problems.

&gt;<i> I see the need for a modular kernel on an I/R, but once installed, and an SA
</I>&gt;<i> knows how to roll his own kernel, the overhead of making a new initramfs
</I>&gt;<i> seems superfluous.
</I>
Lack of initramfs in /boot also makes for more disk savings.


&gt;<i> Also, there is less to go wrong, as there is less
</I>&gt;<i> complexity with a monolithic kernel.
</I>
Actually, some drivers might fail.
If that happens then rebooting is the only solution.
However, with a modular kernel I can merely rmmod
the misbehaving modules and then modprobe them in.
I have a USB wireless NIC on one computer where
that fix is necessary for when uhci_hcd starts misbehaving.
However, I do not know if that problem still exists.

&gt;<i> Which kernel version, and which udev version are you using?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did you recently &quot;tweak&quot; the kernel a bit?
</I>
Even if he did compile a kernel with devtmpfs enabled,
my previous trials did not show that it was a problem
to use that with udev.
I was half tempted to modify /etc/init.d/dev
to mount devtmpfs instead of tmpfs.
However, the devtmpfs is only available in some very newer kernels.
So I did not change the init-script.
Definitely /dev must be a mounted filesystem that
can be mounted from /dev to /media/root/dev
when booting from initramfs.
Otherwise a problem would happen.
I could have created a /etc/init.d/devtmpfs script that
runs before /etc/init.d/dev and tries to mount devtmpfs on /dev
That might be a plausible solution.
/dev would be unable to mount tmpfs on /dev
if some other filesystem is already mounted on /dev before it runs.
But that would also generate a red failure error message during sysinit.
Then again I could create
a more complex /etc/init.d/dev script that checks
/proc/filesystems to decide if devtmpfs can be mounted on /dev
That might be a good solution, perhaps.
But what I do not yet know is if devtmpfs is on /dev
then will udev properly set ownership and mode of device nodes
that are created in /dev by devtmpfs.
Also how long before devtmpfs is dropped from the kernel
like what happened with devfs?
And lastly could devtmpfs or using devtmpfs with udev create
a possible security risk?
What I ready about devtmpfs thus far
suggested that it always creates
root owned mode 600 device nodes.
Hmm, where is the good docs for it.

ABI/removed/devfs:What:         devfs
ABI/removed/devfs:      devfs has been unmaintained for a number of
years, has unfixable
ABI/removed/devfs:      The files fs/devfs/*,
include/linux/devfs_fs*.h were removed,
ABI/removed/devfs:      along with the assorted devfs function calls
throughout the

The stuff I grepped in /usr/src/linux/Documentation is old.

From: drivers/base/Kconfig

config DEVTMPFS
        bool &quot;Create a kernel maintained /dev tmpfs (EXPERIMENTAL)&quot;
        depends on HOTPLUG &amp;&amp; SHMEM &amp;&amp; TMPFS
        help
          This creates a tmpfs filesystem, and mounts it at bootup
          and mounts it at /dev. The kernel driver core creates device
          nodes for all registered devices in that filesystem. All device
          nodes are owned by root and have the default mode of 0600.
          Userspace can add and delete the nodes as needed. This is
          intended to simplify bootup, and make it possible to delay
          the initial coldplug at bootup done by udev in userspace.
          It should also provide a simpler way for rescue systems
          to bring up a kernel with dynamic major/minor numbers.
          Meaningful symlinks, permissions and device ownership must
          still be handled by userspace.
          If unsure, say N here.

config DEVTMPFS_MOUNT
        bool &quot;Automount devtmpfs at /dev&quot;
        depends on DEVTMPFS
        help
          This will mount devtmpfs at /dev if the kernel mounts the root
          filesystem. It will not affect initramfs based mounting.
          If unsure, say N here.
