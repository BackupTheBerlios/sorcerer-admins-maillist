There are some technophobes who can barely operate
anything more technical than a light switch.
And also one would wonder why people use mice or touch pads.
I have observed that computer novices do far better using
a trackball as a pointing device than a mice or touchpad.


&gt;<i> - apparently - even going to replace linux video servers with windows.
</I>
Depending upon what country one lives in
linux based operating systems already have replaced windoze.
Some stuff still seems difficult to digest such as
encrypted WMVs that one might receive as a download
for a ebook rental or library checkout.
But that also will be vanquished in a matter of time.
There was a time that playing DVDs was difficult on linux.
I have some recall about mplayer
being the first with support for playing DVDs with encryption on linux.
Finally, I was able to watch &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;  :)
Well, it was more entertaining than Conan the talk show host.
I apologize if that is just a North American joke.


&gt;<i> &#160;(someday) &#160;But... ya, I think of X as a server for multiple
</I>&gt;<i> terminals, and sdl apps. :)
</I>
Like with remotely logging into a Windoze NT server?
It is possible already.
Even a decade ago I saw something where people
could do remote X11 logins into different machines.
The programs run on remote machines,
but the graphics output on the local machine.
Naturally, it is stressful on the network.
However, having several clients remotely logging into
a single box to run programs could make for a high
CPU and high network load.

Anyway, to make this work one has to configure X a bit differently,
and enable a chooser program and have
X or maybe XDM or something listen on a port.
It is probably in a FAQ or HowTo somewhere.
It is not difficult to accomplish,
but might be a security risk.

SDL seems to work purty good.
Perhaps you might be thinking of DirectFB.
DirectFB is still a bit away from becoming like X11.
But some expect that the raw performance of
DirectFB is far superior to the protocol based X11.
In earlier days even I tried different methods of
video display such as DirectFB and svgalib.

&gt;<i> I dunno, like ubuntu as a whole package is pretty good - it's got your
</I>&gt;<i> basic start menu, all connected and populated... ahh how nice it must
</I>&gt;<i> be to be not source based :)
</I>
Does all software install icons and menu entries
so it appears on KDE's menus?
If you believe that it aught to be so
then please go ahead and draft how files
should be contained in the grimoire
and commence with the the creation
of those icons and menu entry files.
By the time that project is complete
we will have installed KDE-v5  :)
That is why the responsibility for such
should belong to the software authors
and not the distribution maintainers.
But you can always take responsibility
for it yourself if you expect my decision is unwise.

Another alternative is to install a program that
attempts to add those menu entries automatically.
There are a few.
Perhaps:

xfce4-appfinder
xdg-utils
genmenu
dmenu

I expect that there are more.
Someone who is interested in this sort of thing
should probably investigate to discover what
might be good to have installed concurrently
with kde-v4 and be made it an optional for
kdebase-workspace-v4?

Since I start most programs from konsole
I rarely look at menus provided by window manager.
But someone probably has something almost like an
automatic everything type menu solution.
I do not know what it is.

If it is to be handled on the distribution level
then perhaps if a description of purpose
is provided for every file installed by a source
then the combination of the file type,
how the file is ELF linked, and description of the file
can be used in order to determine if and how a menu
entry should be automatically generated.

# augur install soprano | wc -l
214

But it is a big task for some software,
more than I want to do to write a spell.

Assuming that graphics can be omitted,
and candidates for menu entries can be decided
based upon the file type and what it links with
then perhaps descriptions might be extracted
by using either manual pages or what is displayed
when a file is invoked with --help.

$ /usr/bin/xmms --help

has a nice help screen, but fails to describe what xmms does.
The manual page is more useful for acquiring that information.

Having software authors provide the menu entries and icons
would be far easier than having distribution maintainers try
to accomplish the task.
As demonstrated in the above examples
automatically generating menu entries for software
should be possible, however providing menu categories
and concise descriptions is unfortunately more of a
manual task than automatic.

My guess is that most programs that try to generate menus
generate menus for software that the menu generator
was already programmed to recognize.
In other words someone already took the time to type
that Y is an ABC program, etc...
With the continual changing landscape of popular software,
staying abreast of it all is a task that overwhelms even freshmeat.
They have entries for more than 50,000 apps, themes, and stuff,
but aside from indirect intentionally obfuscated hyperlinks
to homepages and download tarballs and also descriptions
freshmeat does not provide information that would assist
in creating an automatic menu generation program.

All I want to say about it is that
I agree that it would be useful to have,
but I much prefer that someone else accomplish it,
because my plate is full already.

Today, I am checking in new versions for perl-- software.
And when conditions become correct I plan to do a revision
of the PPR to make it better able to locate source tarballs,
and to provide more source tarballs and patches as
.tar.xz and .sd3.xz instead of 7za compressed.
And aside from creating a silly dialog tutorial
for the I/R I still have not made any progress towards
adding useful help screens to the menu driven installer
that will guide a new SA along more easily than external docs.
But it is something I am thinking about.

/root/.sorcery/grimoire/install.d/dt

For a laugh run that.
The content may be in bad taste,
but it should help a new SA gain a feeling
for how to input using dialog.
