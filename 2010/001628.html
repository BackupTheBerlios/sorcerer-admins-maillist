<PRE>Good work on the Sorcerer updates.

Am I right in assuming that the Sorcerer I/R's without xorg will also be a
smaller download than the current ones?

In that case, I might be tempted to wait a while till they are out. I am
extremely limited on the download bandwidth that I can use at work.

Thanks for the info. I might even try going from linux-custom to linux
again...

But I need to have a list of things that need to be installed, scripts in
/etc/init.d that need to be run in order to have a valid initram

My last one loaded the kernel, but then could not mount the root filesystem
rw.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is some confusion about linux*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What was linux is now linux-custom.
</I>&gt;<i> What was linux-modular is now linux.
</I>&gt;<i> And of course there are several linux-2.6.* spells also.
</I>&gt;<i> Why?
</I>&gt;<i> See what is listed as stable at <A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/">http://www.kernel.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> That is why.
</I>&gt;<i> The linux spell will provide a modular kernel for the latest available
</I>&gt;<i> linux kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> The older kernels that are still available, listed as stable and maintained
</I>&gt;<i> are available with modular config for the other linux-2.6.* spells.
</I>&gt;<i> The reason for the older kernels is because some hardware drivers
</I>&gt;<i> break and only work in the older kernels.
</I>&gt;<i> Who knows when the fixes will move forward?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The new I/Rs will come with the linux kernel pre-compiled.
</I>&gt;<i> It has all the drivers, experimental and stable, for fancy new hardware.
</I>&gt;<i> The linux kernel to install on boxes is whichever kernel the SA wants to
</I>&gt;<i> cast.
</I>&gt;<i> Once a linux kernel is installed
</I>&gt;<i> then it will take over as the linux-kernel provider.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few boxes might have both gcc and gcc-core installed.
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually those boxes should only have gcc-core installed.
</I>&gt;<i> They should fix themselves.
</I>&gt;<i> But if the box already has gcc-core installed
</I>&gt;<i> and the SA wants to expedite the fix
</I>&gt;<i> then dispelling gcc is safe after gcc-core is installed.
</I>&gt;<i> gcc-g++ is also good to have installed
</I>&gt;<i> to provide for libstdc++ for c++ sources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because some SAs prefer to start from a cleaner loadout
</I>&gt;<i> while others prefer a faster download
</I>&gt;<i> I am excluding xine codecs fonts and xorg related spells
</I>&gt;<i> from the next set of I/Rs.
</I>&gt;<i> That also makes them faster for me to create and check.
</I>&gt;<i> Compiling xorg should not be too difficult for SAs.
</I>&gt;<i> Figuring out what fonts to install tends to be the trickiest part.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ati-driver-installer partially pre-compiled something or another
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be hopeless broke.
</I>&gt;<i> Even without the spell the thing segfaulted when
</I>&gt;<i> I tried to install it from command line.
</I>&gt;<i> I am not eager to rush out and buy an ATI card.
</I>&gt;<i> But if I was I would re-think the idea since
</I>&gt;<i> the NVIDIA-Linux-x86 seems to work fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like xine might have come out on top of the video player contest.
</I>&gt;<i> In some cases it still might play as fast as MPlayer which is a bit
</I>&gt;<i> trickier to
</I>&gt;<i> get working with fonts for subtitles since it requires a font be installed
</I>&gt;<i> as a file in one's home directory.
</I>&gt;<i> Also xine might be able to play newer .mkv formats that might
</I>&gt;<i> look corrupted when viewed in MPlayer.
</I>&gt;<i> KDE's movie player, if I remembered the name,
</I>&gt;<i> seems to use xine-lib.
</I>&gt;<i> So it should basically be a front end to xine
</I>&gt;<i> and have nearly the same rendering as xine-ui.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For those who like a 2D combat/exploration type game
</I>&gt;<i> I finally updated the crossfire spells.
</I>&gt;<i> I put forth extra effort to make certain that it works.
</I>&gt;<i> Overall it looks basically no different than older versions.
</I>&gt;<i> Sliding the panels apart in the client is as tricky as ever,
</I>&gt;<i> but necessary to see what is on the floor, inventory,
</I>&gt;<i> and the informational text.
