<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I am currently testing some changes that obsolete the library cache method for
preserving old ELF libraries during updates.
The library cache method was a complicated.
For a long time, the way it was implemented
had a rare problem area that could occur
if libsepol and libselinux were dispelled concurrently.
Trying to remove installed selinux related spells was the
only way to fowl up the library cache.
Because it was such a rare problem
I took a considerable amount of time thinking
about how I wanted to improve the library cache.

The new method is simple in concept.
When an installed spell is dispelled
the spell's installed files and directories
are moved from their normal prefix into
/var/cache/old/

I will skip the technical explanation of how it works.
It is sufficient to say that /var/cache/old/ is removed only
when sorcery is absolutely certain that no installed software
could require a library somewhere within /var/cache/old/

Until /var/cache/old/ is removed,
which normally will only happen at the completion of a successfully cast spell,
any spell that was dispelled can be restored from /var/cache/old/
using the
# augur undispel $SPELL
command.

For example assume that the command was issued to dispel wine
# dispel wine
Oops, wait, wine will be necessary for running that win32 application.
Do not try to beat dispel to the reap by pressing ctrl-c
That could fail and cause files formerly installed by wine
to stay in the root filesystem as aliens.
That might be bad later or at least a pain to clean up.
So let the dispel command complete.
Then, issue:
# augur undispel wine
Faster than the blink of an eye, wine is back!

However, if a spell is cast after wine is dispelled
and the installed software looks fine to work without
/var/cache/old/
then /var/cache/old/ is removed.
And so goes that bottle of wine.

/var/cache/old/ from here forward will be called the OLD_CACHE
It is cleared automatically when it can be cleared in order to keep
/var/cache/old/ from consuming too much disk space.

There is one other nice aspect about the OLD_CACHE.
Following the successful cast of a spell
if the OLD_CACHE can not be eliminated
then it is searched for SUID and SGID files.
Any SUID or SGID files lose their special mode.
That way any executable that remains in the $OLD_CACHE
can not be exploited by a user to gain unauthorized access
after the installed software has received an update.

So to summarize, the OLD_CACHE will be replacing the LIBRARY_CACHE
It does what the LIBRARY_CACHE did and it does it better.
Also the OLD_CACHE can be used to undispel recently dispelled spells.
That makes running a box without the ARCHIVE_CACHE a bit safer.

Because this transition from LIBRARY_CACHE to OLD_CACHE
provides better &quot;oh noooooo&quot; protection I am changing
the default FEATURE set to exclude &quot;archive&quot;
That means that the archive cache will not be automatically
enable on freshly deployed box that lack a SA defined FEATURE set.
If FEATURE is definied in /etc/sorcery/local.config
then that replaces how FEATURE is defined in /etc/sorcery/config
And as the file states,
do not edit /etc/sorcery/config
Changes there will not stick.

Can you tell that I am somewhat excited about the OLD_CACHE?
It works better than the LIBRARY_CACHE did
and it provides a new convenience for SAs
So far I have successfully tested spells such as:
readline, ncurses, and glibc using the OLD_CACHE.
That definitely gives me the satisfaction of knowing
that it properly fulfills the former duties of the LIBRARY_CACHE

The OLD_CACHE will be ready for SA testing as the unstable version of sorcery
in the next LAG=0 grimoire release.
For anyone using a default LAG=1 box
testing is still more than a day away.
Remember to switch back to stable sorcery when done testing,
because one can never be certain of the quality of software provided
using the unstable version progress.

When I am fully satisfied.
I will make the new sorcery available as stable version progress.
So for normal LAG=1 boxes that is at least 3 days away.

As for version progress...
# augur progress sorcery unstable
# augur progress sorcery stable
Switching it is that easy.
Works for many spells besides sorcery.
However, the versions that are provided as unstable
are not usually compile tested.
And in the case of gnome spells they often require
other gnome spells to be installed with unstable versions
in order to successful cast.
However, both stable and unstable versions are tracked for
many software projects just in order to provide convenience to SAs.

Any SA that wants to ride their box on bleeding edge software can,
but Sorcerer's grimoire by default is not bleeding edge.
Most spells stable version progress has the version that is defined
as stable by the software authors.
And that is usually always true unless Sorcerer grimoire gurus
decide that a stable version is too old and problematic to compile.

More information about version progress is available by typing
# augur help progress
Yes, no special web page exists to locate and read about it.
The sorcery tools, especially augur, provide adequate and verbose help
information.

Sorry for the long email.
Evert mentioned that I should inform Sorcerer SAs
about this change before springing it.
And so I did.
However, for most Sorcerer SAs this change, like many others, is transparent.
It requires nothing new to learn in order to continue using a Sorcerer box
in the same fashion that one always has.
sorcery will just work better and provide more convenience for SAs.
