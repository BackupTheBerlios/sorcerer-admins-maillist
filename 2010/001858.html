&gt;<i> Hmm...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting points....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt Sorcerer checks whether a init script has successfully completed
</I>&gt;<i> before attempting to run the init script that depends upon it.
</I>
It does not check.


&gt;<i> What we need
</I>&gt;<i> as a very basic first step is a way for the init-scripts to be aware of the
</I>&gt;<i> other's init-scripts status.
</I>
It is not usually important.
The proof of that conjecture is the
fact that Sorcerer boxes can boot
the way they are now.



&gt;<i> What I have seen working for other OS's:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When a process starts it writes it's PID into a file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another init-script can then check whether it's requirement scripts are
</I>&gt;<i> running by reading the PID files for those processes and see if those PIDs
</I>&gt;<i> are still associated with the processes. If so, then it's safe to proceed.
</I>&gt;<i> If not, it can try to re-launch the process... if it gets a failed return,
</I>&gt;<i> then it can itself return a fail to the process calling it.
</I>
Not all init-scripts start daemons.
Not all daemons have PIDs
Some services run then immediately exit.
Expected behavior is not known.


&gt;<i> Once we have PID files, we can also write it's process status into that file
</I>&gt;<i> on a new line: Success, initializing, running or failed.
</I>
Almost nothing can be assumed from the content of a PID file.
Sometimes whether a service is running or not
might not be known by examining a PID file
unless the read PID is treated as a SID instead.


&gt;<i> If a process, for whatever reason, re-starts, it should write it's new PID
</I>&gt;<i> into it's PID file in order to keep the PID valid.
</I>
Normally, that happens.
But not all services write their own PID files.
In some cases init-scripts have that task.
So if a service restarts without the benefit
of having been run through an init-script
then the benefit of a PID file could also be lost.


&gt;<i> What this means is that we have scripts that won't start if they have hard
</I>&gt;<i> requirements on other init processes.
</I>
Unfortunately, the current LSB specifications do not address this.
Consequently, that information
is not stored in the comment section of an init-script.
The Required-Start: and Should-Start: suggests
a segregation can be made, but there is nothing in
the documentation that states that Required-Start:
specifies an impassable gateway that must remain
open for later init-scripts to be run.
Those comments are used entirely to control
the ordering of init-scripts and nothing more.


&gt;<i> Definitely, some processes are more vital for a running system than others.
</I>&gt;<i> Should a critical required component fail to start up, we should have an
</I>&gt;<i> automatic &quot;Press Ctrl-D for system maintenance&quot; thingie that I have been
</I>&gt;<i> seeing in RedHat and Solaris.
</I>
Sorcerer's init-scripts are nearly concise enough
to be able to put the SA nearly ontop of the problem
directly after it occurred.
But knowing exactly what caused the problem
might not be discernible unless the SA has control
to explore both before and after the error occurs.
Being able to press CTRL-D or to do a sulogin
is not even close to an automatic solution for
traversing the problematic area.

 In a way, a lot of this behavior is already done by Sorcery in resolving
&gt;<i> spell dependencies, and if we plan to change the init processes, I think we
</I>&gt;<i> should at least look at the lessons we have learned by having thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> spells, all inter-dependent and working properly with no two systems the
</I>&gt;<i> same. There are a lot of analogies between spells casting and init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> executing.
</I>
To be frank about it,
I am not a fan of autofailed spells.
Half, the time I remove the spell from
the failed queue that is causing the autofailure
move the other spells that were autofailed
back into the cast queue.
Or another way of saying it is that autofailure
sometimes a convenience
and sometimes an inconvenience.

I have half a mind to rewrite the rule so that....
A spell can autofail only if it failed to compile
and an older version of the spell is not already installed.
That way if gtk+ fails compilation and gtk+ is not installed
then gtk+ will cause autofailures.
However, if gtk+ fails compilation and gtk+ is installed
then spells that have gtk+ as part of their requirement chains
will not autofail and instead will attempt to cast
if they are in the cast queue already.
Would anyone object to me changing
the autofail rules so that they work that way?

I will post that part again as a separate inquiry on the list
so that SAs not following this thread can have their say about it.
