<PRE>There are many ways to have networking configured.
It can be activated by /etc/init.d/networks
when proper templates have been configured.
It can be activated by udev using rules.
It can be activated by a program such as:
wpa_supplicant

There is no right/wrong way about doing it.
You could even write your own custom init-script
and put it in /etc/init.d/ with mode 700
and then run /lib/lsb/install_initd
This last method is easy if one understands
how to create init-scripts with proper LSB comment section.

#!/bin/bash

### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides: bootmisc
# Required-Start: $local_fs $network $remote_fs
# Required-Stop: $local_fs $network $remote_fs
# Default-Start: 1 2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:
# Short-Description: bootmisc is for lazy SAs
# Description: SAs can add additional programs to invoke during
#       boot to /etc/init.d/bootmisc
### END INIT INFO

That would be adequate for the start of a bootmisc init-script.
After the comments one could add:

dhcpcd eth0

All of my boxes use /etc/init.d/networks
which uses networking templates.
All the information about networking templates
is contained within directories and subdirectories
/etc/networks.d/
It is both very simple and absurdly complicated,
but it can be used to set up network configurations
on any box, including boxes that have multiple
locations and/or have multiple network adapters.

Personally, I would like to have a menu driven
type method for configuring networking.
But there is a lack of consensus about it
and nobody seems eager to write it.
Permanent network configurations take
only a few seconds to minutes to configure
and then a box is good to go for probably
about as long as it will ever be deployed.
So nobody is too eager about an elaborate
method that will only ever be used once per box
and might be more restrictive than what can
currently be accomplished using the system
of network templates and functions.

Although network configuration is definitely
do-able on Sorcerer I still consider the matter
to be a sore-spot on Sorcerer boxes.
All the command line tools for network configuration
are available on Sorcerer boxes.
However, no certain documentation or clear consensus
exists about how GUI, menus, or fluffed up interfaces for them.
Almost every distribution has it's own unique methods
for doing networking configuration.

Years before I introduced the template system
and the /etc/init.d/networks init-script to activate it
SAs were instructed to directly edit
/etc/init.d/network and type the exact commands
to invoke command line tools for network configuration.
While that might seem a bit harsh,
there are still SAs that would prefer that
network configuration was still done exactly that way.

However, these days there is a policy that
init-scripts are not configuration files.
Therefore, modifications to files in /etc/init.d/
are not preserved across updates.
The only modification that is preserved
is the mode of the init-script.
Mode 0700 init-scripts are active.
Mode 0600 init-scripts are inactive.
If you want to change an init-script
just chmod it and run /lib/lsb/install_initd
Failing to run /lib/lsb/install_initd is not a problem.
If it should have been run it will run itself later
provided that the box is properly shutdown.
Probably better to run it in advance.

Speaking of custom configuration files...
Files in /etc/ except those in /etc/{init.d,sorcery,gconf}/
can be customized.
And the customizations will stick across updates.
However, copies of original uncustomized configuration
files are stored in /etc.ori/
Therefore, if a SA wants to undo a customization
or apply the customization to a newer configuration file
then the SA can copy the file from /etc.ori/
into /etc/ and make modifications as necessary.

Sorcerer has rough spots like the
endless amounts of ways to configure networking.
However, it also has conveniences such as the
/etc.ori/ directory which contains original configuration
files that are current for the software which is installed.
For years I have listened to SAs complain about
the problems involving customized configuration files.
Sometime after we started trying this solution
nobody seems to be complaining anymore.  *lol*
Maybe it is not the best solution.
But it does seem workable.
