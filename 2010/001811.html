Yeah, I also rolled a kernel in those days which
I could not boot.
Was funny.
I asked a friend what to do about it.
He said copy the file.
I did, and it landed at the other end of the disk
within the 1024 cylinder.
Then, it booted.
Even though /boot partition is no longer
required to get around the 1024 cylinder problem
having a /boot partition is not without advantages.


&gt;<i> Ext2 had/has a filesize limit of I believe 2GB, which, gave me problems
</I>
I have had files in excess of 2G on ext3.
I am uncertain if ext3 is that much different
than ext2 with a journal attached.  :)
Limit regarding the size of files that can be accessed
depends on what functions are used for file access.
With IA32 there is still a choice.
With x86_64 only the 64 bit functions are used.


&gt;<i> when I started mastering the .COM zone myself for failsafe reasons years
</I>&gt;<i> ago.
</I>
Wow small world.
I have not seen a .com zone file since
the days before the .com was moved off
of the root name servers.
I was probably in charge of the least capable root name server.
How embarrassing.
But it was not my fault that the Internet connection
was like trying to suck an elephant through a drinking straw.


&gt;<i> Nowadays, most folks don't understand the significance of a /boot on its
</I>&gt;<i> own partition, but there are nevertheless still a lot of good reasons
</I>&gt;<i> for the implementation of that practice :)
</I>
I can think of many.  :)


&gt;<i> Sorry that you ran up against this, but hey, you got some kewl practice
</I>&gt;<i> in Sorcerer installs eh?
</I>
The installer still needs improvement.
More screens with useful information
to help guide SAs through the steps
would be useful.
I did not do a great job with it.
I paved the roads, but mostly
left out the sign posts.  :)
But a person too familiar with the streets
drives them without every looking at a sign post.
So I sort of forgot where they should go.

Even this moment I am thinking that I should
probably be driving in more sign posts
or rolling new I/Rs.
But I am still waiting for the dust to settle
following the transition to DESTDIR.
Just last night Jan pointed out a spot
where I was doing something in the wrong
order which would cause the potentially
useful files in /etc.ori/ to not be installed.
How embarrassing since I like to boast
about having the convenience of /etc.ori/
on Sorcerer boxes!

So today I am playing with my uClibc port of Sorcerer.
I have had it for probably over a year now,
but rarely have time to play with it.
Creating a usable uClibc configuration is tricky.
Having stuff compile and work with it is also challenging.
It is mostly usable as a libc implementation,
but not a drop in replacement like eglibc.

Mostly, I like uClibc.
If uClibc swallowed a frag grenade like xorg did
and re-appeared as several small easy to install sources
then it could have the potential to do to glibc
what xorg did to XFree86.  :)
Really, I liked XFree86, everything except the
massive amount of effort to create the configuration
file prior to compiling it.
Sorcerer went a long time before switching to xorg
and for a few years supported both XFree86 and xorg,
back around the time when Sorcerer was hosted at
aakin.net.

Anyway, so when the dust has settled from
the DESTDIR transition I will roll new I/Rs.
