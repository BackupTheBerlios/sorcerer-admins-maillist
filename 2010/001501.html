<PRE>oic you've already covered this ;)

&gt;<i> Because of the size/download requirement of a &quot;Live CD&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and also the fact that Sorcerer is a source based compile
</I>&gt;<i> if installed type distribution, Sorcerer does not provide a &quot;Live CD&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> We have only an Install/Rescue CD image
</I>&gt;<i> for IA32 and x86_64 architecture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know they work.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually the process is.
</I>&gt;<i> Download, burn, boot, login as root using no password,
</I>&gt;<i> run sinstall, visit the menus, complete the installation,
</I>&gt;<i> reboot, configure networking, raise networking,
</I>&gt;<i> do initial set up updates, select software for installation,
</I>&gt;<i> wait a few hours and check it see if it is done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I test the menu driven installer I do not do a fancy install.
</I>&gt;<i> I usually do one or two partitions with ext3 filesystems.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually a 1G /boot and the rest for /
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The last error reported with the I/R occurred due to
</I>&gt;<i> a bu that only showed up when a box also has a
</I>&gt;<i> floppy drive installed.
</I>&gt;<i> However, almost immediately after that bug was reported
</I>&gt;<i> I rolled new I/Rs and uploaded them.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, they should be ready for download and use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I could roll new I/Rs within a few days...
</I>&gt;<i> I an contemplating on postponing any new I/R release
</I>&gt;<i> until after I write a new kernel config
</I>&gt;<i> and after I finish rewriting the server code for the
</I>&gt;<i> Public Patch Repository.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Someone might have a step by step guide for
</I>&gt;<i> navigating the install menus, but I only write the
</I>&gt;<i> menu driven installer.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, on the next release of it
</I>&gt;<i> I will have added more documentation
</I>&gt;<i> directly into the installer that helps explain
</I>&gt;<i> in detail how each menu works.
</I>&gt;<i> Already I wrote a generic dialog tutorial
</I>&gt;<i> that will help new SAs learn how to use dialog
</I>&gt;<i> to make choices and input information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone spots a bug during the process of
</I>&gt;<i> booting and using the menu driven installer
</I>&gt;<i> then please report it for a prompt fix.
</I>&gt;<i> If no bugs are reported
</I>&gt;<i> then the next release of the I/R
</I>&gt;<i> becomes a low priority item that will be delayed
</I>&gt;<i> often until after a newer glibc is released.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, the I/R is the lowest priority item in the todo list
</I>&gt;<i> and that is why I have not yet written and tested improvements
</I>&gt;<i> to the menu driven install program that I described above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because I do not test the I/R on the thousands of possible
</I>&gt;<i> hardware combinations; I rely upon bug reports in order to
</I>&gt;<i> make fixes and improvements to it.
</I>&gt;<i> I of course do limited testing on the I/R each time using qemu.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, whatever is currently available for download
</I>&gt;<i> is expected to work.
</I>&gt;<i> Please give it a try.
</I>&gt;<i> If bugs are encountered please report the bugs.
</I>&gt;<i> And the shifts the I/R back to high priority on the todo list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, top priority is the testing and release of KDE version 4.4.1
</I>&gt;<i> So far the probability for it going out in the next
</I>&gt;<i> LAG=0 grimoire is looking good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know there are a few live distro available.
</I>&gt;<i> Ubuntu might still be a live distro.
</I>&gt;<i> But I am not knowledgeable enough to
</I>&gt;<i> make a recommendation about what distro to use.
</I>&gt;<i> The closest that Sorcerer will become to a live CD distro
</I>&gt;<i> is to install Sorcerer onto a USB thumb drive.
</I>&gt;<i> A 32G thumb drive would be adequate,
</I>&gt;<i> but even 16G would do with a limited loadout of software.
</I>&gt;<i> Once it is installed on a USB thumb drive it should
</I>&gt;<i> be bootable and usable on any computer that has
</I>&gt;<i> BIOS that can boot from removable USB media.
</I>&gt;<i> Generally, those are computers with motherboards
</I>&gt;<i> manufactured on or after 2004.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck in creating a Sorcerer live USB installation
</I>&gt;<i> if you want to give that a try.
</I>&gt;<i> However, a traditional install to a fixed disk
</I>&gt;<i> is still the recommended installation method.
</I>&gt;<i> Although disk devices are now mounted according to UUID
</I>&gt;<i> which should allow for a live installation of Sorcerer to
</I>&gt;<i> be portable and usable among several different computers;
</I>&gt;<i> as far as I know this is not tested extensively.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know if anyone carries their Sorcerer box's filesystem
</I>&gt;<i> on their keychain to use on multiple computers.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> However, with Sorcerer's support for LUKS encrypted filesystems
</I>&gt;<i> the possibility for carrying Sorcerer on a keychain yet keeping
</I>&gt;<i> all the installed data free from theft and modification
</I>&gt;<i> is very good.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could you please tell me when you have all the bugs worked out of the sorcerer linux live cd download as well as a step by step guide to install it on a formerly windows xp computer as the only operating system? I have already erased all the partitions and xp system and all I need is the bug less live cd to download and a step by step guide to install it on an empty computer.
