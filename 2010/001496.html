<PRE>Ah, I am glad Pekka Panula announced that.
Saved me some typing.
And was probably more concise than my long winded style.

Anyway, the reconstruction of the PPR is a bit more complex
than the reconstruction of sorcerer.
The PPR is receiving improvements
that will make it more capable of locating source tarballs.
And it will be compressing sdelta3 patches and tarballs
using xz instead of p7zip.
And it will be have more compressed tarballs available,
which will be smaller than before.
Also the time to wait for patch generation
and compression will be less than what it is currently.

Lastly, I hope to rediscover how to make work the directory
that will automatically silently generate patches and
compressed tarballs upon demand when a file is requested from it.
When that worked correctly a file could be requested and
it would be silently created if necessary and then presented
for download after a short delay if the file was not already
previously cached somewhere on the server.
In effect it was like a proxy, yet more sophisticated since
it could create patches and p7zip compressed tarballs.

The current PPR is no longer what it used to be.
The topology of the Internet changed.
The PPR is not as good at finding sources
as when it was first deployed.
I have received requests to hack it into better shape.
However, instead I decided to put the effort into creating
a second generation PPR that is not merely fix,
but also an improvement over the original.

I apologize about letting the PPR slip.
But with limited man power and CPU cycles something must give.
Yet now is a great opportunity to hack a better PPR,
because it will be able to achieve the performance,
and experience that was desired from the beginning.
Just like how the init-scripts have evolved over the decade
eventually every sore spot about Sorcerer
eventually receives attention and achieves vast improvement.

Hopefully, after the new PPR is ready and deployed.
It will be in good shape to be neglected
for half a decade and yet still run great!
Are not automatic services great?

That is what has been happening during the first quarter.
Not very exciting for Sorcerer SAs since it represents an
invisible infrastructure change that will probably not be noticed.
However, this is by far the best hosting transition
that Sorcerer has ever had.
We owe Pekka Panula great thanks for providing
the extraordinary excellent hosting of Sorcerer
and Sorcerer related services.
