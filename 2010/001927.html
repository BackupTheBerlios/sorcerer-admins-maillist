<PRE>Actually, I anticipated the request.
# augur help activity

This activity log generator is similar to the previous incarnation.
However, no separate activity logs are used.
Instead this merely seds certain lines of information
out of # augur event 3650

fail shows lines with events of Fail Auto and Fail Cast
load shows lines with events of Fail Load and Pass Load
pass shows lines with events of Pass Cast, Pass Rise, Pass Oust, Pass Void

Even better than using this command is to invoke
# augur event 365

and sed or grep desired information and pipe it into less or a file.
This command only exists to provide backward compatibility
with the previous # augur activity
which is no longer needed.

# LC_ALL=C augur activity pass | tail -n 10

But that might not be as useful.
There are several types of pass type events
and only the &quot;Fore&quot; events count for being current.
&quot;Yore&quot; events are historical and no longer expected to be current.

# LC_ALL=C augur activity pass | sed &quot;s:  Fore::p;d&quot; | tail -n 10

But if one is only interested in the Pass Cast events that are also Fore...

# LC_ALL=C augur activity pass |
sed &quot;s:  Fore::p;d&quot; |
sed &quot;s:  Pass Cast::p;d&quot; |
tail -n 10

Even the parts of the date on the left column can be trimmed out
if the seem unnecessary or are causing the lines to be too long.
sed is awesome for that.

In many ways this # augur activity
is not much different than
what can be done directly with
# augur event
and a sed command.
That is because that is exactly how the activity command is implemented.

For a chronological summary of the last 20 events in the last 30 days
without regard to whether the event is considered &quot;Fore&quot; or &quot;Yore&quot;

# augur event 30 | sed &quot;1,/^$/p;d&quot; | tail -n 20

The sed command chops off the scroll at the empty line
just before where the summary of events begins.
Then the tail command limits the output to the most recent 20 lines/events.

If only Fail Cast events are desired...

# augur event 360 | sed &quot;1,/^$/p;d&quot; | tail -n 20 | sed &quot;s:  Pass Cast::p;d&quot;

And change the Pass Cast to Fail Cast

Event logs are available for view directly and can be ordered
by spell chronologically, or all events chronologically depending
upon the invocation of ls used, however, no indication of whether
and event is &quot;Fore&quot; or &quot;Yore&quot; is given by ls unless one wants
to examine the mode of the file.

# ( cd /var/log/sorcery/event &amp;&amp; ls --sort=time -r | column -t )

The output is very similar, however the date and time is displayed
by the very large integer in the second column that looks like:
YYYYMMDDhhmmss

Currently, I have been considering, but have not decided how to
include additional information in the output of # augur event.
Some event files are not size 0.
Some of them have content that further explains the event.
Usually, those are the &quot;Miss *&quot; events where the content
of the file will indicate what ELF library or file is missing.
Perhaps that is only useful for debugging
since &quot;Miss ELF&quot; and &quot;Miss LA&quot; events are handled
automatically and normally fixed by cast.

The current event logs, and the
# augur event $DAYS
# augur event $SPELL
commands are in every way superior
to the old activity logs.
Unfortunately, they require a tad bit more SA skill in order to squeeze.
Sed can help separate the juicy desirable information from the pulp.
grep will work also, but is a little less useful.
Any sort of stream editor should work.

If for nothing more than the &quot;Yore&quot; and &quot;Fore&quot; assignment to events
then I would say that the event logs are an improvement.
However, this revision also consumes less disk space by /var/log/sorcery/event/
Event logs are reasonably fast to view with &quot;augur event&quot;
&quot;ls | cat&quot; and &quot;ls | column -t&quot;
And event logs can now be ordered chronologically to achieve
the same amount of information as the activity logs and more.
In the past there were SAs that wanted all the information
in all 3 activity logs merged and displayed chronologically.
Now their wish is granted by the output of &quot;augur event&quot;
or merely by doing the &quot;( cd /var/log/sorcery/event &amp;&amp; ls --sort=time
-r | column -t )&quot;

Everybody gets what they want,
except for those still longing for those
3 files in /var/log/sorcery/activity/
However, those 3 files can be generated from the output of augur event
by using one of the commands shown above and
piping the output into a file such as: &gt; /var/log/sorcery/activity/cast


As for tailf for directories...
about a decade ago I knew the answer.
Remembering lore is difficult.

Install inotify-tools if it is not already installed.

Also

# gzip -cd /proc/config.gz | grep INOTIFY
CONFIG_INOTIFY=y
CONFIG_INOTIFY_USER=y

Or reconfigure the kernel or use linux spell.

Then finally...

# inotifywait -m -q -e create -r /var/log/sorcery/event

And it will print something like:

# inotifywait -m -q -e create -r /var/log/sorcery/event
/var/log/sorcery/event/ CREATE sorcery-alien    20100916014140  2010-9  Cast SA
/var/log/sorcery/event/ CREATE sorcery-alien    20100916014208  2010-9
 Pass Oust


And it will spit out a new line every time a file is created.
Or for a more space economical version...

# ( cd /var/log/sorcery/event &amp;&amp; inotifywait -m -q -e create -r . )

piping output through sed might work
or it might delay the output of lines.
I am not certain since I did not try it that way.
