<PRE>Good questions.
They are not explained usually because the answers
are considered general SA knowledge.
More or less it is not distribution specific knowledge.
Purty much it works the same on most distros.
Basically, you probably want a X server
and to be able to login using a graphic user interface
and then be able to select programs to run from a menu, yes?
Fortunately, it is not difficult to accomplish.

# cast xorg firefox kde-v4
# nano /etc/inittab
Change the default runlevel from 3 to 5

Now when the computer starts it will also start kde-v4
and present a graphic logic prompt
instead of the usual virtual consoles.
But it will only do so if it can properly detect the installed
graphics hardware and pointers automatically.
Otherwise an /etc/X11/xorg.conf file is required.
I use one anyway.

A distribution such as Sorcerer, Debian, or Ubuntu is basically
layers upon layers of software.
At the very bottom or core is the linux kernel.
The linux kernel provides drivers for interfacing with hardware,
protocols, and filesystems.
The kernel is also the gatekeeper to such devices
and enforces security and determines how much of the CPU
each running process should receive.

The layer that is most directly above the kernel is the C library.
Few programs talk to the kernel directly when they want to
access filesystems, devices and protocols.
Instead the very useful and basic functions for accomplishing
those tasks are stored in the C library which is provided by glibc.

Almost all software on a box that is compiled either links
with the static or ELF libc libraries.
Programs linked with static libraries have the code contained
in the library copied directly into the program.
Programs that link with ELF libraries instead have the library code
loaded into memory as needed when the program starts.
ELF libraries save disk space and allow for better updating,
because if an installed ELF library is updated then any software
linked with the ELF library immediately receives the benefits of
the update without having to be recompiled, assuming that
the new library is binary compatible with the old library.
In contrast programs linked with static libraries must also
be recompiled in order to receive the benefit of library updates.

Other libraries sit a bit higher than C library
and usually also link with the C library.
An example of such a library is libX11.
The X11 library is a library of functions that programs can link
with in order to do graphic output to an X server.

The X server is the really fun piece of software that is capable
of putting the screen into graphics mode and having concurrently open
different windows for different programs.
However, using the X server bare is difficult to do because
it does not provide for an easy method of resizing and moving
windows around.

A plain X server is usable.
It is not very interesting.
And typically it will close automatically when no
open programs are connected with it.
So generally, having at least one program connected to it
becomes a good idea to avoid having to restart it each time.

The one program that usually stays connected to the X server
all the time is the window manager program.
A window manager does just as it's name suggests.
It allows for windows to be minimized, expanded, moved around
and other fun things.
If an X server was a potato
then a window manger would bake it for you.

Both GNOME and KDE are more than just window managers.
KDE is the K desktop environment.
Likewise GNOME is the gnome desktop environment.
They provide all sorts of fancy programs, menus, eye candy,
effects and other stuff to the experience of using the X server.

Most of GNOME is in C, or at least it used to be.
So it tended to be lighter on resource consumption.
In the past it used to be a fast pleasant experience
that was a good compromise between a desktop environment
and a lightweight window manager.
But I have not used gnome in a while.
Instead I tend to prefer KDE version 4.

KDE is entirely C++ and built upon the Q graphic toolkit
that is provided by trolltech,
and that library continues to change name.
Currently, it is called qt-everywhere-opensource.
KDE tends to be a bit slow, a memory hog,
but some of the apps are useful and one can come
to enjoy the KDE experience if their disk drive and
memory are sufficient to avoid lengthy reads and swapping.

There are other choices for window managers
and also for desktop environments.
However, KDE and GNOME tend to make other desktop
environments look like little more than enhanced window managers.

The most basic window manger that comes with xorg
is called twm, which is short for &quot;the window manager&quot;
Whether anyone uses twm, other than for testing,
is curiosity question.
Although it is a feature minimalistic window manager
and it does work.
However, twm is more of a demonstration program
than a 1st choice window manager for any distribution.

Programs such as firefox link with libX11 and also gtk+,
the graphic toolkit used by gnome that was separated
originally from the gimp project.
Naturally, to enjoy that awesome web browsing experience
with firefox one must be able to start an X session,
and using at least a window manager is preferable.
Yet X can be made to start with just firefox running.
If done that way the X session ends when firefox closes.

For a minimalistic window manager I tend to prefer yeahwm,
although it is a bit buggy and will flake if run long enough.
However, for an awesome experience I recommend running KDE.
Yet KDE will seem slow as can be on anything less than an
1 Ghz Athlon with 512M or more RAM installed.
Probably KDE is not a good choice on low RAM boxes,
and especially not while such a box is updating installed software.

Although many Sorcerer SAs are irritated by how much
installed software comes on the I/R
it actually provides enough installed software in order to
start an X session using twm as the window manager and
to play a movie using xine.
No, firefox does not come pre-installed,
nor does KDE and gnome.

An installed Sorcerer box can be stripped down to a console
only installation with no libX11 or libraries from xorg installed.
That only requires a little bit of effort.
However, far more easily KDE and firefox can be
installed on a new Sorcerer box.

Also as a Sorcerer box updates the performance
will gradually improve as the new software installed
is tailored automatically to the available instruction set
of the installed microprocessor.

I hope that helps explain a little.
Sorcerer only provides a means for useful common software.
However, we do not train SAs in the use or configuration of software.
To learn how to use it I would read
the manual page for xorg.conf
then the manual page for the desired graphic driver,
then the web site documentation at <A HREF="http://x.org">http://x.org</A>
and then perhaps a HowTo, Guide, or FAQ
from <A HREF="http://www.tldp.org">http://www.tldp.org</A> which is the linux documentation project.

Some distributions attempt to replicate the documentation
available at the above URLs,
yet the task becomes impossible because the software authors
make changes and revision which each release and any
3rd party documentation quickly becomes obsolete compared
to the documentation that is available from the software authors.

The manual pages that come with installed software along
with any documentation for the software which might be found
in /usr/doc/ or /usr/share/doc/ tends to be the most current source
of information about the software.
The next most current source of information is documentation
that is available from the software author's homepage.
The third and not usually current source of information
is documentation provided at the linux documentation project.

The further the documentation is from the installed software
and the software author's documentation
then the greater the probability that the information will be
incorrect or obsolete.

For example x.org that is currently standard on many distros
was forked originally from the XFree86 project.
One could learn something about using X from reading the
documentation at the XFree86's project's homepage.
However, the documentation would probably be describing
something that is a bit different than what xorg current provides.

The best thing about using a distro like Sorcerer
is that it tends to provide nice new free software quickly.
The bad aspect is that documentation for such software
might be scattered across the fixed disk or across many
websites on the Internet.
Sorcerer could try to bring that documentation all into one place,
but such a task is even more monumental than the task
of providing the methods for downloading and installing new software.
However, Sorcerer SAs are not at all abandoned.

Typically, almost every spell has a homepage line in it.
The homepage link is a URL to the software author's homepage
and usually by following hyperlinks from that URL one can arrive
at suitable documentation.

# augur homepage firefox
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html</A>

 # augur homepage xorg
<A HREF="http://www.x.org">http://www.x.org</A>

# augur homepage glibc
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc">http://www.gnu.org/software/libc</A>

Useful yes?

A distribution basically is a gigsaw puzzle made from
piecing together many other software projects in a way
that is meaningful and usable.
Sometimes pieces have to be rounded out.
Sometimes they must be pounded into place.
Consequently, each distribution contains nearly the same software,
yet each distribution might also have a somewhat unique feel to it,
and unique methods for using it.

With Sorcerer the distribution layer that sits between the SA
and the software installed is intended to be translucent
and paper thin.
Other distributions have such a thick feel to them that
the SA is often prevented from directly configuring installed software.
Such distributions try to relieve the SA of the task of having
to configure installed software.
However, with Sorcerer, software is installed by sorcery,
but always configured by the SA.

One might say that the aim of Sorcerer is to give SAs
nearly all the power and configurability
that could be achieved by manually installing software,
yet without the headache and huge time commitment.
That is because sorcery makes both installation and updating
of software the dictionary definition of easy.
However, configuration of installed software
still remains dependent upon SA skill and knowledge.
It is the type of compromise that senior level SAs enjoy,
but could cause plenty of confusion for new SAs.

There are also course, computer based training,
and books that teach UNIX system administration
and Linux glibc POSIX system administration.
But to be perfectly honest about it
there is no good substitution for visiting software
author's homepages and also reading manual pages.
Trying to learn the the technique from reading a single book
has the problems of showing a point of view that will exclude
potentially useful knowledge and will also present knowledge
of no immediate use that could become confusing.

I have seen people who try to learn
a programming language by reading a book.
Yet if one wants to learn a programming language
then the best method is to write a program and learn
along the way exactly what knowledge is required in order
to complete the task.

If one wants to increase SA skill
then one of the better ways to do so is to write some
useful shell scripts.
All the knowledge required to do so is contained in
the manual pages for the installed software such as:
bash, coreutils, grep, find, sed
And looking at a few example scripts helps also.

Thanks to considerate software authors,
and also the help of Debian maintainers,
almost all installed software comes with documentation,
manual pages, and info pages that are installed with the software.
The answers to almost any SAs questions
are already contained in some file already installed on their box.
However, finding the desired files to read
tends to be a bit easier for senior level SAs than new SAs.

I do not wish to sound less than useful.
However, to be perfectly honest about it
when I want to know something about installed software,
I tend to look at the install log, the installed manual pages,
the installed info pages, the homepage, and sometimes
I even extract the source tarball content and grep through
the source tree.
So basically, I do not do anything differently
from what I advise others to do when seeking answers
to questions about how to use and configure installed software.

Definitely, the technique for learning how to learn how to
compile, install, configure and run software is more important
to a SA than how much a SA already knows.
Although much of the basics remains the same
software is constantly evolving.
New features are added.
For example at one time to edit a file using sed required
that the file be piped through sed,
written to a new file name and
finally renamed back to the original filename.
Now sed supports the -i parameter to instruct it to
edit a file instead of a stream from stdin.
Yes, it is a small change but it provides useful functionality.
To me that seems to provide a good example of change.
The sed found in distributions that provide the GNU implementation
will support the -i parameter.
However, sed provided by other UNIX might not.
ls provides by the GNU implementation can accept switches
at any point within the command line parameters.
However, Solaris ls implementation only recognizes switches
if such parameters come before any directory and/or filenames.

Depending upon the implementation and version provided
there are thousands of variations in commands and parameters
support by commands.
Utilities such as find, grep, sed, sort, uniq might be standard on
all POSIX and UNIX implementations.
However, there can be considerable difference
in what command line parameters they support.

Therefore, if knowing exactly what software one has
and what it can do is important
then that task can usually only be accomplished by the
SA doing a first hand examination of the program's help screen,
version, and manual pages.

There is no all powerful tome that describes everything
that can be done with the installed software on a box.
I definitely understand how it could seem like an appealing idea.
However, the task is far greater than a small group of people
could accomplish.
Even many of the HowTos at the Linux Documentation
project website are half a decade or more older.

If any such group of people could amass and track so much
information about free software projects and present it in
a useful form to SAs
then such a website would easily obsolete OSDN's freshmeat.
And OSDN's freshmeat is hardly a gathering point for documentation
although sometimes change logs snips are provided with
information about new releases of software that freshmeat
attempts to track.
Yet even freshmeat is usually not able to provide announcements
about all new available software unless freshmeat users inform
freshmeat staff that new releases are available,
which is often accomplished using a freshmeat account
and their website CGI forms.
More simply put even freshmeat is not an all-seeing-eyeball
upon free software.

The way software sources and documentation are provided
has so much variation in it that currently even information providers
such as freshmeat, distrowatch,
and even distribution maintainers tend to be blind
to a some portion of updates that are potentially available.

If a distribution can keep aware of 70% or more of software
updates over the course of a year
then that tends to be a considerably maintained distribution.
freshmeat tracks more software than any distribution does,
and I dare to speculate that their awareness of updates
might be less than 20%
Of course when tracking as many projects as freshmeat does
they are bound to show updates from many software projects
each day.
However, they are still not the all-seeing-eye of software evolution.

That probably provides too much information.
SAs might not be aware of all the effort required
in order for distribution maintainers to keep abreast of
both the availability of software and the changes in software
in order to keep distributions working properly.

Currently, the lack of consensus among how software and
documentation should be distributed makes for an interesting
challenge as distribution maintainers continually try to
pound the puzzle pieces together.
Some distributions might provide some fancy documentation
that make them look like they have it all going on in the right way.
But in truth every distribution has blind spots
and the best distributions will tend not to be the one's
with the best presentation, but rather the ones concentrate
on doing what a distribution should do best
which is providing software for easy installation.
And that is why Sorcerer SAs tend to stay with Sorcerer.

Sorcerer is not trying to bring the sun moon and stars.
It is just a daily tide upon which new software floats in.
And it is not intended to be any more complex than that.
