<PRE>Two Sorcerer SAs are having a discussing Sorcerer's init-system.
Part of it spelled out over the main email list.
But it is rather confusing to read for anyone not interested.
However, I have been reading it
and I want to learn the consensus about a potential change.

A new proposal is for init-scripts to run slower
by having those init-scripts that exit with success
create lock files in /var/lock/ that indicate both the
name of the init-script that ran and any service name it provides.
Doing so comes at a cost of overhead,
and slower runlevel execution.

Creating lock files in /var/lock/ is not pointless.
The intended use of such lock files is to prevent init-scripts
that run later from running if the init-scripts or service that
they require did not successfully start before it.

For example,

# grep Required-Start: /etc/init.d/udevd
# Required-Start: dev-cp sys

# grep Required-Start: /etc/init.d/udevtrigger
# Required-Start: udevd

If the dev-cp init-script returns failed or is missing
then the udevd init-script would never be started
and if udevd never starts then udevtrigger never starts
and coldplug events are never replayed.
Therefore, no modules are loaded and
no device nodes are created.

It works something like that.
One failure during boot could create a rather
large cascade of auto-failured  init-scripts

The current method of executing init-scripts
does not require lock files and normally will
not create a lock file unless the init-script
explicitly creates a lock file.
Usually if an init-script creates a lock file,
such as /etc/init.d/networks
then it is that init-script that will also
check for the existence of a lock file.
Lock files have limited use and no purpose
other than what an init-script would define for it's own lock file.
Naturally, this method has only the overhead that it already has.
It is neither slower nor faster since it is the default method.

So to recapitulate
The current method logs errors in red, ignores errors,
and continues booting as best as possible.
I floss my teeth and am not afraid of a little bit of red every now and then.

The proposed new method turns a tiny little red mark
into a huge bloody wound by thrusting in a knife and giving
it a hard twist.
Or less metaphorically a tiny error that happens early
can turn into a mountain of init-scripts that will not be executed,
just because a prior init-script failed or was missing.
And the new method is slower and runs more processes as overhead.

So do we go with the devil we know?
Or do we risk new bugs
by fixing what is not broken?

Make no assumptions about who wants what.
This is not about politics or siding with one person or another.
This discussion is about how each SAs wants their box to run.

So the question is,
&quot;Do we stay with the current rapid fire and forget init-script launch method,
or do we add in CPU cycle munching control methods
that could lead to greater control over the execution of init-scripts
that would probably be used to autofail init-scripts that require
an init-script that did not run or return with an error?&quot;
