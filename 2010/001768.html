The initial Sorcerer install is more complex
and has a greater chance for error than
usually doing a simple direct fix for a problem.

&gt;<i> So I'm going for a reinstall
</I>
That should work also.
But without backups you may lose the benefit
of /var/cache/{sources,ccache,archive}
Re-installation of Sorcerer should be done
to a clean initialized filesystem.

&gt;<i> But now another problem arise.

</I>&gt;<i> /dev/hdc2 is /&#160;is the rest&#160;of a 60G disk.
</I>
That will work for a modern box with an
ext2 or ext3 filesystem for /
Not all filesystem types have a reserved boot sector
so if uncertain about the filesystem
then install lilo to the MBR


&gt;<i> So I boot&#160;from the&#160;dvd I burned.
</I>&gt;<i> Started up the install programm.
</I>
With the corrections to avoid the floppy problem, yes?

&gt;<i> Goto&#160;adjusting&#160;fstab
</I>&gt;<i> And now I only&#160;see the swap partition.
</I>&gt;<i> And when I choose for device , I get another screen but never can I say the
</I>&gt;<i> installer must look for&#160;/dev/hdc2
</I>
Then does /dev/hdc2 exists?
I recommend doing also
# ls -lah /dev/hd*
And seeing what partitions are detected on which devices.

&gt;<i> Can&#160;it be that I first must format it or do i something wrong here.
</I>
Modern fixed disks require no formatting at any time
and doing so might ruin them.
However, they do require partitioning.
To partition or check the partitions of /dev/hdc run:

# fdisk /dev/hdc

If the partition table was merely modified by something
and if the partitions can be made exactly how they were before
then the filesystems might be salvage-able.
I suspect that the partition table for a disk
is just slightly after the MBR or maybe a little bit before.
But it is up there.
Nulling enough sectors at the front of a disk
will wipe both the partition table and MBR.
In some cases that might be useful,
but in your case probably not.

If the /dev/hdc2 partition exists
then it shows up as a block device node /dev/hdc2
A partition must only exist on a disk to receive
a device node in /dev/
There is no requirement that the partition be
readable, valid, or mountable.
If /dev/hdc has crashed or became defective
then an entire entry for the disk device will
probably not be created in /dev/ rather that
an omission of a partition.

For the mapping of disk devices to device node names
linux usually goes by what BIOS suggests.
Therefore, if a bootloader switches BIOS's primary
and secondary disk devices
then to linux they will appear switched also.
That can be a useful trick for booting a bootable
backup with lilo instead of having to actually open
a box and remove/adjust jumpers on disk devices
to reselect the former slave drive as a master.

If /dev/hdc does not have the expected partitioning
then at least check the size and become somewhat
certain that it is the disk that it is expected.
Also if it has a valid partition on it
check that partition either with the file command
or by mounting it to see that it is as expected.

Almost a decade ago and before I began using qemu for testing
I wiped out a partition that I had windoze installed on.
I only booted windoze in order
to flash update firmware in hardware devices.
But that hard lesson learned shows that one can never
be too careful when fdisking and modifying partitions.

If one repartitions a disk, creates new file systems,
starts installing to them
then after all that recovery of previously installed
filesystems and data becomes hopeless.
Please make backups of important files and/or filesystems.
