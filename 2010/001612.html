<PRE>&gt;<i> Dunno how many times it has compiled gcc-core, 10 times maybe ;)
</I>
The SA of the box might have enabled a feature
that the SA did not understand such as the reuse feature.
The reuse feature should only be enabled on production boxes
that do not compile software but instead use software from
a /var/cache/archive/ shared with a developmental box.

Take gcc-core for example.
gcc -v | grep -q objc should return true
if the installed gcc was compiled with objective-c support.
If not then gcc-core's current function returns false
and gcc-core goes into the cast queue.
Does gcc-core recast?
Yes.
Does it recompile?
It will if the reuse feature is not enabled.
If reuse is enabled then the existing and probably flawed
gcc is restored from /var/cache/ccache/
and the installed gcc never becomes objective-c enabled.
This will continue to happen until the SA turns off the reuse feature
or until the available version of gcc-core changes and a new
gcc is installed.

sorcery is different than pre-compiled binary based distros.
Installed software can be updated even
without the version changing.
That is because the version given to installed software
is always the same version that the software author uses
which is decided normally by how the software author named
the source tarball.

In a few days lilo will recast on Sorcerer boxes.
It will be the same version of lilo as installed.
Why recast?
Because the installation of lilo config files has changed slightly
and the new lilo spell will install a newer init-script
and default files for /etc/lilo/{head,tail}
Please be sure that lilo actually recasts instead of
unarchiving the existing /var/cache/archive/lilo... archive.

I am making this change for several tiny reasons.
First, this change makes fewer entries in /etc/
which is already crowded.
Second, it provides default /etc/lilo/{head,tail}
for boxes where it is missing.
Third, /etc/lilo/{conf,fast,head,tail} are within /etc/lilo/
Fourth, /etc/lilo.conf is provided as a symbolic link to
/etc/lilo/conf for SAs that executed /sbin/lilo
instead of /etc/init.d/lilo.
That is also useful for SAs expecting to find an /etc/lilo.conf
Fifth, /etc/init.d/lilo.conf was renamed to /etc/init.d/lilo
to become more obvious to SAs that
/etc/init.d/lilo should be run.
Sixth, /etc/lilo/ will be mode 600 to avoid a possible
security problem if echo /etc/{lilo.conf,lilo/{conf,head}}
somehow become mode 644
Finally, /usr/sbin/lilo will be a wrapper script.
It will invoke /etc/init.d/lilo
That way SAs running lilo at the command prompt
will automatically run /etc/init.d/lilo instead of /sbin/lilo

Boxes with reuse enabled and
are not properly connected to a /var/cache/archive
will encounter a problem
when the lilo modifications go into effect.

Should I remove the &quot;reuse&quot; feature from sorcery
in order to keep SAs from accidentally derailing their boxes?
