&gt;<i> please tell me step by step how to configure the fstab menu in laymans terme because i keep getting the essential fields are missing
</I>

When specifying only one partition for mounting as /
then the amount of questions to answer are 2!

First, what should it be mounted as.
Answer the mount point is /
Second question, what type of filesystem is it?
Answer, whatever you want.
I recommend ext3.
After that the way out of that menu is probably by
pressing right or left arrow followed by enter.

All the other fields are filled in automatically.
If the partition already has a detected filesystem
then that also is entered into the filesystem spot.

I am thinking that I made the way out of that menu
too different than others and also am not providing
enough information so that the SA knows what spots
must be entered.

The menu is called the fstab menu because it acquires
mostly the information that would be used to construct
the file /etc/fstab.
Among other things /etc/fstab is used to describe filesystems
and memory swaps to activate or that can be activated by
either root or users.
fstab is an abbreviation of the word filesystem table.

Since a disk can have many partitions
that can belong to separate operating systems
the use of file system table is to tell a POSIX operating system
what filesystems belong to it,
when those file systems should be mounted,
and what permissions should those filesystems be mounted with.
In short it is like a tiny, text only registry for filesystems and swaps.

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab</A>
<A HREF="http://man.he.net/man5/fstab">http://man.he.net/man5/fstab</A>

Those are two potentially useful pages about /etc/fstab
More importantly than knowing what to enter
in the install menu is to know what is required,
why it is required, and how it is used.

Once the concept and layout of /etc/fstab becomes familiar
then the Sorcerer install menu will make sense.

The only way it differs is that Sorcerer supports
LUKS encrypted filesystem upon block devices.
Also Sorcerer allows filesystems to be created on
almost any type of block device whether that block
device represents a partition, a software md RAID,
a logical volume, a device mapper created device,
or a LUKS device.
That sentence might seem confusing because Sorcerer
does offer more choices for block and filesystem configuration
than many other distros that have elected to deprecate
the use of partitions in favor of logical volumes

During boot Sorcerer sets up software raids first,
then logical volumes, and finally LUKS encrypted filesystems.
So there can be a LV made of RAIDS,
but not RAIDS made of LV.
LUKS encryption can be applied to partitions,
raids, or even LVs, because that is the last step.
But a LV can be be made of separate partitions that
are individually LUKS encrypted.
Some distros have the order of setup done differently
in a nonsensical way that would allow a each partition
to be encrypted and then added to a LV.
But then that would require 2 password prompts
to gain a password for each partition to decrypt
before adding it to the logical volume.
Sorcerer's order makes sense because
space can be gathered from many drives to be
assembled either as a md software raid or a logical volume
and then that single unit can be LUKS encrypted
with a single password.
I probably would not do that, but a SA can do that.

Once you master a basic installation
then for a notebook computer an installation with
the / partition encrypted might be desirable.
That type of installation differs slightly.
First, it requires a 1G ext2 partition mounted as /boot
which is never encrypted.
Second, it requires a nice fat / partition which is encrypted.
Third, it can optionally have an encrypted swap partition,
which is initialized on each boot with a random key
which means after shutting the box down any data
that was written to a swap partition is forever scrambled.
Naturally, an encrypted swap partition might not be the
best choice for a notebook being used in suspend to disk mode,
since an encrypted swap would be useful for resuming a
previous session.
However, Sorcerer boxes tend to boot really fast
and so suspending to disk is not recommended.

So first, please learn the layout and purpose of /etc/fstab
Unfortunately, the way the menu driven installer is written
I am assuming that the person using the menu driven installer
already knows about /etc/fstab
Consequently, gaining that knowledge should help clear
up misunderstanding about it.

Please understand that every POSIX has an /etc/fstab
even if that POSIX is actually a UNIX such as Solaris.
So learning about /etc/fstab is not a one time waste of effort.
The knowledge will probably continue to be useful for decades.

Although much changes about the way POSIX are implemented
some things like /etc/fstab
have remained almost entirely the same for decades.
But I suppose that only become evident with retrospect.
But as such I would expect any UNIX or POSIX SA to know
about /etc/fstab

As I mull it over in my mind I am contemplating what the best
method to teach totally new SAs the ropes while they are using
the menu driven installer.
Perhaps having the manual page for fstab displayed
could be useful?
Or maybe there should be a menu of useful manual pages
to select in order to provide references?

SAs tend not to remember every little thing about every little thing.
Instead when we want to know more about something
we read a manual page by typing man followed by something.
For example:
man fstab

One of the above URLs in this email shows a manual page for fstab.

The thing about showing manual pages is...
Are only experienced SAs and POSIX
users able to read and understand them?
I wondered that a decade ago when I was teaching
novice SAs how to gather information by reading manual
pages and visiting the linux documentation project and
reading HowTos.

Short of expensive computer based training provided by
the company that one works for the way that most SAs
learn the tools is by reading help screens, manual pages,
HowTos, FAQs, Guides, and just editing files.

The menu driven installer can not be expected to provide
the same level of training as computer based training.
But is providing manual pages at least useful?
I would appreciate your opinion when reading the above URLs
about whether not you feel as if you fully understand /etc/fstab
afterward.

Since the Sorcerer menu driven installer tends to cater
to the experience level of a senior level SA it provides
very little additional information.
Of course it can provide more information,
but to what degree should it attempt to obtain
before useful information because a useless pile of information?
It can not be computer based training.
So if a SA can not read and understand the manual pages
then the additional information merely becomes more information
overload that does not lead to completion of the task.

With almost 3 decades of computer experience
I am considerably beyond the point of being able to properly
achieve and understand the perspective of someone
who is entirely new to POSIX and computer concepts.
That is one of the reasons why my students could gain a point
each day for providing a useful answer,
and another point for helping a fellow classmate.

Maybe there is a free online book or publication that
someone can read that provides instruction in POSIX
system administration?
It is not a complicated subject but there is a bit to learn.
It would probably seem like a mountain to learn if a SA
did not first know what /dev/ is and the purpose of the
directories and nodes within /dev/

There is a considerably amount to learn,
more than should be explained by an install program.
Maybe the approach of the Sorcerer menu driven installer
is entirely wrong for new SAs?
It simplifies the tasks that a senior SA would otherwise do manually.
But a distro that specializes in new SAs might be one
that attempts to partition automatically,
automatically selects where to install
and automatically select filesystem type
and tries to do everything automatically
instead of burdening the SA with having to know
what /etc/fstab is or the purpose of nodes in /dev/ ?

Perhaps if the Sorcerer menu driven installer continues
to be one that a senior level SA would want to use
to achieve the exact style of install that they want
then if providing manual pages to read does not provide
enough information to complete the task of installing
then that type of installer would still remain
impossible to use for someone new to system administration.

Consequently, I am strongly considering on my todo list
the addition of a dialog tutorial for the menu driven installer
and also a menu of useful manual pages to read.
If that would not be enough to complete installation
then it is the fault of the advance design
of the menu driven installer.
If one is going to fly a class-A fighter aircraft
then they better know the difference between the
throttle, yoke, and rudder pedals before they sit
down in the cockpit.
However still having a knee-board sheet is fine.

Given that consideration perhaps two install programs are required?
One can be like it is now with the addition of a dialog tutorial
and manual pages.
However, the other program must be one that can accomplish
an installation of Sorcerer with nearly no questions asked.
And that is a tad bit harder than it might seem to be at first
without the possibility of a noob overwriting an existing
partition for an operating system that they might want to keep.

If a person buys a new computer
and it comes with 1 or 2 partitions
that are already full of something
that probably belongs to a windoze operating system
then how is someone who is entirely new going
to be able to install Sorcerer on it
with no place to install it?

I could use some feedback about that because
I never install different operating systems to the same disk.
I always put different operating systems on different disks.
I have never resized nor shrunk a partition and filesystem.
I have no idea if that can even be done safely with NTFS.

Consequently, my idea of a very simple no questions asked
install program is something where someone runs it
and half a second later it displays a message that says,

&quot;Primary disk has no available space for a new Sorcerer partition.
Installation is not possible.
Have a nice day.&quot;

As if that is any use?
Even better is the question where to put lilo
if another operating system is on that disk?
lilo in the MBR might not be safe.
Heck, it might not even be possible to accomplish
if BIOS has MBR virus protection enabled
and is denying write access to the MBR of the disk.

I guess that tends to show why I would not want
a method for installation that is no questions asked.
I expect that it also would probably encounter problems.
Might be entirely impossible to complete if the SA never
pressed delete or F1 during POST in order to visit the
BIOS/CMOS configuration menu and disable MBR write protection.

I would not want to be a new computer user these days.
So many factors contribute
to keeping computer users in the dark.
I probably would not be able to escape the clutches of windoze.
What can be done about it?

Even a computer with a POSIX pre-installed
being received by a new computer user is analogous
to giving a baby a set of tesseracts
in place of building blocks.
Yes, kind of cool, but still a concept that
is bit difficult to graps at first.
