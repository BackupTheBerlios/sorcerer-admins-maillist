<PRE>Congratulations on the new box. I hope it serves you for a long time.

ATI is also supported by free drivers in x.org, you might try with
those... But it's been a while since I used those myself. I also
prefer NVIDIA.

&gt;<i> My venerable computers have been falling apart.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, the traditional fixes of scotch tape and bubble gum
</I>&gt;<i> have been to no avail.
</I>&gt;<i> So I bought a new case, motherboard, RAM, CPU and cobbled it together.
</I>&gt;<i> I totally expected that would all I required, but I was wrong about that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, I can not say enough bad things about ATI's pre-compiled binary
</I>&gt;<i> drivers and/or chipset.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, I will just begin with what seems most irritating.
</I>&gt;<i> First, sometimes what they distribute is not always installable,
</I>&gt;<i> compilable, or useable.
</I>&gt;<i> Second, what they currently distribute is unable to compile
</I>&gt;<i> the required kernel module that is required for OpenGL graphics.
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately, I found 3rd party patches that fixed that.
</I>&gt;<i> Third, unless one uses the ATI catalyst control center in order to properly
</I>&gt;<i> set the over-scan to 0% then ATI's graphics card sets a default
</I>&gt;<i> over-scan of -15%
</I>&gt;<i> which creates annoying black boarders making the screen smaller than
</I>&gt;<i> it should be.
</I>&gt;<i> The fix requires the X server to be configured without xinerama.
</I>&gt;<i> If xinerama is enabled
</I>&gt;<i> then compositing is disabled
</I>&gt;<i> and all the beautiful KDE eye candy does not work.
</I>&gt;<i> The mutually exclusive xinerama compositing support is the 4th irritation.
</I>&gt;<i> ATI chipset can do OpenGL and play games.
</I>&gt;<i> However, when pixel shading is enabled then
</I>&gt;<i> it often displays images with black textures
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the proper textures.
</I>&gt;<i> That 5th issue would be sufficient to become
</I>&gt;<i> the proverbial one too many hay straws
</I>&gt;<i> that breaks the camel's back.
</I>&gt;<i> However, a free game such as Perfect World International
</I>&gt;<i> can be played with black textures
</I>&gt;<i> for about 15 minutes before the X server locks up.
</I>&gt;<i> The 6th issue of having the X server lock up is beyond tolerable.
</I>&gt;<i> And if the X server locks up or must be restarted
</I>&gt;<i> then there is a high probability that X will not be killed
</I>&gt;<i> and that ATI's driver will print a message that
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;[kernel] Fixing recursive fault but reboot is needed!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ATI graphics cards and drivers are questionably or barely suitable for
</I>&gt;<i> use on linux.
</I>&gt;<i> Having the graphics card tell me to reboot my computer
</I>&gt;<i> is the 7th final unacceptable miserable failed excuse
</I>&gt;<i> for a manufacturer provided driver!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, I bought a NVIDIA graphics card today.
</I>&gt;<i> Although I have not installed it yet,
</I>&gt;<i> NVDIA performance seemed satisfactory in the past.
</I>&gt;<i> Provided the fan does not melt into place right away
</I>&gt;<i> then perhaps it will last for a whole 6 months?
</I>&gt;<i> Among the choices between ATI, Intel, and NVIDIA chipsets
</I>&gt;<i> I am the least dissatisfied with NVIDIA's performance and
</I>&gt;<i> quality of pre-compiled driver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The good news is that I now have an x86_64 workstation.
</I>&gt;<i> I compiled an x86_64 Sorcerer and
</I>&gt;<i> then moved that from /opt/x86_64/ to /
</I>&gt;<i> while moving the old IA32 Sorcerer to /opt/ia32/
</I>&gt;<i> So now I have a much better opportunity to do both
</I>&gt;<i> compile and runtime testing of x86_64 software
</I>&gt;<i> and also to make improvements concerning the
</I>&gt;<i> installation of software on x86_64
</I>&gt;<i> and also hone the method for keeping a choorted installation
</I>&gt;<i> of Sorcerer IA32 in /opt/ia32/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably with the exception of the people with legacy boxes
</I>&gt;<i> and those who purchased laptops or mini-notes with early versions of the Atom
</I>&gt;<i> microprocessors which lacked long mode support
</I>&gt;<i> then almost everyone has at least one x86_64 box.
</I>&gt;<i> And now I am also on-board due to my favorite 10+ year old computers
</I>&gt;<i> dying in ways which standard solutions failed to fix.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not everyone would understand the value of keeping an IA32
</I>&gt;<i> installation in /opt/ia32.
</I>&gt;<i> And yes, doing so is completely optional.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is useful for running win32 applications in wine
</I>&gt;<i> or any pre-compiled commercial software that requires ELF32 libraries.
</I>&gt;<i> Some software a SA will have to chroot into /opt/ia32/ to run
</I>&gt;<i> as I did when testing the ELF32 vs ELF64 firefox with macromedia flash plugin.
</I>&gt;<i> However, some ELF32 software can be run directly without chrooting
</I>&gt;<i> and it will run because the directories holding ELF32 libraries
</I>&gt;<i> are also included in /etc/ld.so.conf
</I>&gt;<i> and therefore indexed in /etc/ld.so.cache
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I was testing firefox was for Evert,
</I>&gt;<i> who wants flashplugin to work to work with x86_64 firefox.
</I>&gt;<i> And the results are that flashplugin works just as good or just as
</I>&gt;<i> lousy in both.
</I>&gt;<i> The x86_64 box has nearly the same software available for installation
</I>&gt;<i> with less than a 1% difference as compared to IA32.
</I>&gt;<i> Software tends to work equally good in both installations.
</I>&gt;<i> So SAs are welcome to run either one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what are the advantages to using x86_64 over IA32.
</I>&gt;<i> I only know a few of them.
</I>&gt;<i> First, programs can address up to nearly 64G memory.
</I>&gt;<i> On IA32, even with a PAE enabled kernel,
</I>&gt;<i> an individual program was still limited
</I>&gt;<i> to the amount of memory it could address.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore the amount of data that an individual program
</I>&gt;<i> could have in RAM at a time was about 3G
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately, that is not usually a concern unless somone
</I>&gt;<i> is running a GTLD name server on bind
</I>&gt;<i> or some other program that uses an enormous amount of RAM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, x86_64 has more CPU registers available.
</I>&gt;<i> In theory this enables the compiler to store more data
</I>&gt;<i> in the CPU registers at a time and thus possibly use
</I>&gt;<i> the stack space in RAM less often for pushing and popping registers.
</I>&gt;<i> Saving on the use of push and pop instructions is a possible gain
</I>&gt;<i> although data saved on the stack is more likely to remain in the CPU's RAM cache
</I>&gt;<i> than be transferred all the way out to the RAM chips and back when needed again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Third, floating point mathematics is accomplished
</I>&gt;<i> with SSE instructions by default on x86_64.
</I>&gt;<i> On IA32 the 80x87 instructions are used instead.
</I>&gt;<i> Although I have only tested the speed of SSE vs 80x87 instructions on
</I>&gt;<i> an Athlon-XP
</I>&gt;<i> the performance of floating point intensive programs was identical.
</I>&gt;<i> So what are the advantages of using SSE instead of 80x87 on x86_64?
</I>&gt;<i> First, there are more SSE registers.
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, the MMX instructions share the same registers
</I>&gt;<i> as used by the 80x87 on all architectures.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, if the 80x87 is not in use
</I>&gt;<i> then those registers can be dedicated for exclusive use by MMX instructions
</I>&gt;<i> instead of having to switch modes to use it for one or the other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some people might say that the 64 bit registers of an x86_64 are an advantage.
</I>&gt;<i> However, most sources are designed
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to compile and run on both
</I>&gt;<i> IA32 and x86_64 architectures.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, most programs are entirely sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> with using 32-bit integers and 32-bit pointers.
</I>&gt;<i> However, by default on x86_64 architecture
</I>&gt;<i> unless a program's source specifies that an integer should be 32-bit
</I>&gt;<i> then both integers and pointers are 64-bit.
</I>&gt;<i> Is this good?
</I>&gt;<i> Technically, storing 64-bit integers and 64-bit pointers in RAM
</I>&gt;<i> requires twice as much RAM as using 32-bit integers and 32-bit pointers.
</I>&gt;<i> When more RAM is used then programs must page fault more often
</I>&gt;<i> to have RAM mapped into address space.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, programs run slower.
</I>&gt;<i> Whether 64 bit integers and 64 bit pointers is a boon or a bane
</I>&gt;<i> becomes more a matter of preference and programming style.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I can not estimate if the boon of additional registers
</I>&gt;<i> more than compensates for the use of additional memory.
</I>&gt;<i> It probably would vary depending upon the program being run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Overall an x86_64 operating system is not all cake and candy.
</I>&gt;<i> However, in some important ways it exceeds IA32.
</I>&gt;<i> SAs that do an x86_64 installation with separate IA32 installation in /opt/ia32/
</I>&gt;<i> can enjoy a good compromise of both types
</I>&gt;<i> that should be capable of running nearly anything desired.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Augur has a useful command
</I>&gt;<i> for assisting a SA with an /opt/ia32/ installation.
</I>&gt;<i> Please see
</I>&gt;<i> # augur help ia32
</I>&gt;<i> for a detailed description of how it works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In summary no need to run out and buy new boxes to run Sorcerer on.
</I>&gt;<i> IA32 support is not going away.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the lowest architecture supported with
</I>&gt;<i> the next set of Install/Rescue images
</I>&gt;<i> will be the i686 architecture.
</I>&gt;<i> Initially I wanted 3 Install/Rescue images.
</I>&gt;<i> x86_64 which is SMP,
</I>&gt;<i> ia32-SMP which is SMP
</I>&gt;<i> ia32-UP which has a non SMP and non PAE enabled kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> The reason for IA32-UP is most useful only for the pentium-M
</I>&gt;<i> microprocessor which was the only microprocessor of the i686
</I>&gt;<i> generation that lacked PAE instructions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, I am waffling about whether I want to create and provide
</I>&gt;<i> the IA32-UP Install/Rescue disk.
</I>&gt;<i> I will skip the long explanation.
</I>&gt;<i> A pentium-m with 1G of 400Mhz DDR2 RAM is a formidable and useful laptop
</I>&gt;<i> that is even powerful enough to be used to watch shows on hulu at
</I>&gt;<i> adequate frame rate,
</I>&gt;<i> while running at the lowest CPU clock speed of 600Mhz.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the use of such laptops today might be rare.
</I>&gt;<i> I administrate just one laptop like that.
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone want to admit running Sorcerer on a pentium-m?
</I>&gt;<i> If not then I might choose not to provide an IA32 UP-non-PAE
</I>&gt;<i> Install/Rescue image
</I>&gt;<i> since most distributions provide PAE enabled kernels by default.
</I>&gt;<i> Pentium-M became useless for deploying most linux distributions
</I>&gt;<i> merely for that one minor omission of the PAE instructions.
</I>&gt;<i> That decision long ago probably forced pentium-m out of the consideration
</I>&gt;<i> for use of of running distributions which provide and run the linux kernel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Due to computer failures and
</I>&gt;<i> my purchase of parts to create an x86_64 workstation
</I>&gt;<i> the November 1st target for new Install/Rescue ISO9660 images
</I>&gt;<i> was completely not met and now considered aborted.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for anyone holding out for the multipathd related fix
</I>&gt;<i> for the Install/Rescue images.
</I>&gt;<i> After the dust settles
</I>&gt;<i> then we can aim for a December 1st release.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the inconvenience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I am slow in answering emails,
</I>&gt;<i> sorry, I was neglecting my box for a few days.
</I>&gt;<i> I was transferring disks from my old workstation
</I>&gt;<i> to my new workstation and due to the complications
</I>&gt;<i> with ATI's drivers I was most of the time
</I>&gt;<i> without a usable X server and could not run mozilla firefox.
</I>&gt;<i> But I did commit some useful bug fixes into the svn grimoire
</I>&gt;<i> while I was compiling software.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully that will help squish bugs that were inferred,
</I>&gt;<i> but not reported in detail.
</I>&gt;<i> And to be blunt about it
</I>&gt;<i> starting with an x86_64 I/R and compiling a full box
</I>&gt;<i> with KDE and xorg was very straight forward and simple.
</I>&gt;<i> It was a good experience.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet I was slightly dismayed.
</I>&gt;<i> I hope to dig uncover bad bugs and make many fixes.
</I>&gt;<i> The grimoire is in good condition.
