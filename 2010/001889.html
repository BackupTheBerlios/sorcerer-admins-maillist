&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One giant bug report here. I am updating one older server and noticed that

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. bug, does not discover gcc is installed if your locale is something else
</I>&gt;<i> than english. Current lilo logic is brain dead and its grepping &quot;version&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> word from gcc version output, put if you happen to use some other locale,

</I>&gt;<i> code to discover if you have gcc).
</I>
Thanks.
I will add LC_ALL=C in front of the make commands.


&gt;<i> 2. problem. I am not sure but on my older sorcerer installation lilo does
</I>&gt;<i> want to use bcc command, but it should be recomended only, not sure whats
</I>&gt;<i> different as i tested on sorcerer test server (its newer installation,
</I>&gt;<i> installed on this year), it compiles fine without bcc, but on this other
</I>&gt;<i> server i am getting compile time error because bcc is missing... lilo spell
</I>&gt;<i> requires bin86, but bin86 does not provides bcc and those other binaries if
</I>&gt;<i> bcc is installed - afaik then lilo needs dev86 not bin86.
</I>
# which bcc
/usr/bin/bcc

# augur from /usr/bin/bcc
Dev86:/usr/bin/bcc

# augur compile lilo | grep bcc | wc -l
26

Nice spot.

&gt;<i> Good news is that grimoire does includes Dev86 (why its spell name got a
</I>&gt;<i> capitalised D, should it be just dev86?), i founded it and casted it.
</I>
# grep source /root/.sorcery/grimoire/Dev86
    source <A HREF="http://www.debath.co.uk/dev86/Dev86src-$VERSION.tar.gz">http://www.debath.co.uk/dev86/Dev86src-$VERSION.tar.gz</A>

Why does the software author have capitalize the 'd' in the tarball name?


&gt;<i> 3. problem. Then i noticed several problems with Dev86 spell. It does not
</I>&gt;<i> install those required binaries, like bcc, bcc-cpp, bcc-cc1, copt and
</I>&gt;<i> unproto what lilo is trying to use.
</I>
I will try recasting Dev86 to see what the problem might be.
No problem.
The install log for Dev86 was the same as before.
# diff /etc/sorcery/log/install/Dev86 Dev86

# augur install Dev86 | grep /usr/bin/bcc
/usr/bin/bcc

&gt;<i> If you manually compile dev86 and copy those needed binaries to
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/local/bin you notice then that those missing binaries needs more files
</I>&gt;<i> that current spell does also not install. Lots of files that should go to
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/lib/bcc (i think), but current spell does not even make /usr/lib/bcc
</I>&gt;<i> -dir.
</I>&gt;<i> So you manully need to copy those missing files to:
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/src/sorcery/.destdir/Dev86/usr/lib/bcc (wierd).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I managed to compile newer lilo, but i haven't try to boot it yet, those
</I>&gt;<i> pesky udev problems leaves usually /dev empty if udev version and linux
</I>&gt;<i> kernel does not match, thats one big problem also when you have older
</I>&gt;<i> installation like i have. Several servers installed many years ago, and when
</I>&gt;<i> i needed to update it, because security problems and need for new features,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. its big pain to update and nervous business to boot them if you need
</I>&gt;<i> newer kernel, because many installations i have here has been bugged with
</I>&gt;<i> udev problem. Has anyone else managed to get problems if you use older
</I>&gt;<i> installation and you update your system and after reboot its boot goes
</I>&gt;<i> broke, like almost all files are missing from /dev?
</I>
There might be a usable /etc/coldplug/dev/
In which case a problem with udev could be circumvented by
adding coldplug to the kernel command line.

Also on boxes using the newer kernels that support
devtmpfs then devtmpfs is mounted on /dev instead of merely tmpfs

The docs about that in
/usr/src/linux/drivers/base/Kconfig
state:

          This creates a tmpfs filesystem instance early at bootup.
          In this filesystem, the kernel driver core maintains device
          nodes with their default names and permissions for all
          registered devices with an assigned major/minor number.
          Userspace can modify the filesystem content as needed, add
          symlinks, and apply needed permissions.
          It provides a fully functional /dev directory, where usually
          udev runs on top, managing permissions and adding meaningful
          symlinks.
          In very limited environments, it may provide a sufficient
          functional /dev without any further help. It also allows simple
          rescue systems, and reliably handles dynamic major/minor numbers.


Therefore, it might be something like what we used before udev.
What was that called?
Was it also called devtmpfs no, mabe it was called devfs.
Perhaps that might pop up 0600 root:root device nodes
as kernel modules are loaded?
But even so the loading of modules is normally done by udev
except when the kernel parameter coldplug is given.

If I am feeling exceptionally paranoid
then I untar a previously working archive of udev
into /etc/udev.sav/ so it is included on the initramfs
and I can copy it and use it if necessary.
Depending on how old it is it might not work.


&gt;<i> Anyway, Is lilo even maintained anymore?
</I>
I sometimes wonder that about software.
I remember checking a new version
of it sometime this or last year.  :)
Or maybe it was in 2007
lilo-22.8.src.tar.gz            19-Feb-2007 13:18  427K
According to ibiblio.org's HTTP server.

For the most part lilo is very solid
and it still compiles without patches.
For lack of change who knows what problems
were avoiding for using lilo for the last 3 years
instead of original and new grub?


&gt;<i> What i would like to see is that we
</I>&gt;<i> switch over GRUB2, it looks promising and its what all major distros uses,
</I>&gt;<i> it's been maintained and developed actively and it got more features than
</I>&gt;<i> lilo can provide.
</I>
Last I looked the new grub was also considered unstable.
It might also be a tad bit easier to mis-install it
since it does not use /dev device names.
grub can do one nifty thing that lilo does not.
grub supports loading multiple initramfs per kernel image.
Other than that, for the purpose of merely booting a box
it has no significant advantages over lilo.
Except for an invalid /etc/lilo.conf preventing re-installation
grub is perhaps no safer than using lilo.
However, grub is larger, more complex, requires
itself to be installed in the MBR, can read ext2/ext3 filesystems,
and can play a knockoff of space invaders.
Might not be what everyone wants,
especially someone who wants something
other than grub installed in the MBR.

My challenge about grub is still the same.
I do not use it and so I do not know how to
integrate it with sorcery's init-scripts.
However, if someone writes decent init-scripts
that work as good as those for lilo
then it would be possible to add grub as an option.

I suspect most Sorcerer SAs do not want me to
switch Sorcerer over to grub and risk introducing bugs
that will derail boxes from booting just because
I want the support for loading simultaneously
both a common and a kernel specific initramfs
image during boot.

The rewards for switching to grub should far outweigh the risks.
If someone is making a list of boons and banes
and writing init-scripts for it
then it will probably happen.
Otherwise if I leave it alone
then it is one less thing I will break about Sorcerer this year.
The transition away from using sentinel was plenty of headache.
