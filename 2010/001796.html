<PRE>Okay, now I am getting a clue.

First, I do not know if XFS has reserved space
for a boot block.
The wikipedia entry does not tell  :)
However, the XFS FAQ at
<A HREF="http://xfs.org/index.php/XFS_FAQ">http://xfs.org/index.php/XFS_FAQ</A>
says:

&quot;Q: Does LILO work with XFS?

This depends on where you install LILO.

Yes, for MBR (Master Boot Record) installations.

No, for root partition installations because the XFS superblock is
written at block zero, where LILO would be installed. This is to
maintain compatibility with the IRIX on-disk format, and will not be
changed. &quot;


Sorcerer tends to install lilo to the boot block
of /boot or if /boot does not exist
then to the boot block of /
If / is XFS then the cause of the problem is the SA.

Can lilo read an initramfs and kernel from an XFS filesystem?
I do not know.
But having lilo installed to the boot block
of the XFS filesystem is corrupting the XFS filesystem
and is the reason why it becomes unable to mount.

Recommended solution:
Box with:
2G /boot partition
2G swap partition
Remainder / partition

Make the /boot partition ext2
Use that for an installation and it will work.
Alternately, you could attempt to use
lilo installed to the MBR while the kernel
and initramfs are stored on the XFS filesystem.
This I do not recommend.
But if you try it
then also edit /etc/lilo/head and add
a boot= line where
what comes after the =
is the device name for the disk
where the lilo should be installed such as:
boot=/dev/hdc
If I remember correctly you were installing Sorcerer
to a fixed disk /dev/hdc?

Sorry about the inconvenience.
It is not a bug, nor something I can correct.
I only use ext2 and ext3 and do not know
about the limitations of the other filesystems.
I instead assume that SAs that want to use
them will install their boxes in a way that will work.
Generally, I recommend the use of a dedicated
ext2 /boot partition.
That makes almost everything work,
and avoids complications with RAIDS, LVM2,
and a dedicated unencrypted /boot partition
is absolutely essential for having a LUKS encrypted /

In retrospect this is entirely obvious.
Yet, I was expecting that you were using ext3
until you wrote the error message about
/sbin/fsck.xfs

I wish this was an easily correctable bug
like we have been digging up since the transition
to DESTDIR style installation.
But a configuration with lilo trying to install
to the boot block of an XFS filesystem
should fail on every distribution
and not just Sorcerer.
Just add a 2G ext2 /boot
on the next install attempt
and this problem goes away  :)

I understand that it can be frustrating
to run head-long into this show-stopping error
now twice in a row.
Had you mentioned the filesystem type for /
in an earlier email
then I might have guessed the problem faster.

I am adding to the boot_partition_warning message
another line to instruct SAs that a dedicate ext2 /boot
partition will be required when / is an XFS filesystem.

I have no clue if the same is true for JFS
or other filesystems that are supported.
Ah, apparently JFS does reserve a boot block.
I just looked it up.
But I am not going to research it in advance
for all the filesystem types supported by linux.
