<PRE>Testing this time required longer than usual.
But the testing is progressing.
Soon a new glibc and KDE-v4 will be available.

Additionally, I was playing around with prelink.
Yes, it is a waste of time.
But some might misjudge Sorcerer for avoiding it.

I have integrated prelinking with cast again.
Prelinking will not modify the libraries that not owned by the spell being cast.
Years ago that either was not possible with prelink,
or required modification of prelink's source
or was something that
I did not allocate enough time to figure out.
However, now it seems to work.
Naturally, the first spell prelinked must be glibc.
That is because every ELF prelinks with ELF libraries from glibc.

Anything that casts will attempt to prelink it's ELF libraries
and prelink it's ELF executables with ELF libraries that
are already prelinked or being prelinked for the spell being cast.
Therefore, some or all of the files attempting to prelink might not be
prelinked.

For example, let's say that a box has glibc prelinked
and is casting gmp
/usr/lib/libgmp.so.3.5.2
will prelink
However,
/usr/lib/libgmpxx.so.4.1.2
will not prelink unless the installed libstdc++
provided by gcc-g++ was prelinked before.
So in this example
only part of the installed ELF libraries
installed by gmp will prelink.
That is not bad.

So the next question on many SAs minds might be, &quot;What is prelinking?&quot;
When ELF executables run then libraries must be loaded and symbols resolved.
prelinking allows for part of that to happen in advance in a somewhat static way
so that ELF executables can load with a bit less CPU usage.
Does this make programs run faster?
No.
If a program is loaded repeatedly
then the very slight speed gain from prelinking
will allow that program to run more times per second
than it would if the program was not prelinked.

Q: So does prelinking make a difference?
A: Not at all.
Q: Should I recompile all installed software on a box
  in order to gain an advantage from prelinking?
A: No that will just add wear and tear to the fixed disk.
Q: Do I invoke prelink from a command line?
A: No prelink is automatically invoked by cast
and running it from command line should not prelink anything.

If a program is to be loaded and run repeatedly
oh like 1000 times per second
and that is maxing the cores
then prelinking the program might allow it to run 2000 times per second.
That might expedite incredibly bad written shell scripts.
But it has no effect on sorcery,
because the sorcery tools are efficient fast scripts.

Maximum repeated start up speed for a program is achieved
when the program is statically linked and already in the kernel's cache.
No relocation, no ELF libraries.
Such programs are rare on Sorcerer,
but I have decided to add another.

/usr/libexec/ccache/ccache is now statically linked.
Even faster than a static linked ccache is
a static linked unstable version of ccache.
Unfortunately, it is not compatible
with old saved ccached object files.
But it is plenty fast on the re-compile
and might now be the fastest of any compiler cache type program.
Hopefully, the 3.0 stable release of ccache will be soon.
Basically, any upgrade of gcc or ccache invalidates
all the saved object files.
Yup, everything in /var/cache/ccache/ goes to waste.

However, suggestions and feedback do not go to waste.
I put the suggestions about setsid to good use.
Thanks.
With newer sorcery the augur abort function will
properly kill all the processes that it should kill
and should not leave a configure script hanging.
