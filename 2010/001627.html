<PRE>Some software was written with the expectation that there
would never be a db version 5.0.x
But there is.
I upgraded.
And I also sedited several sources
in order to make the compile with the newer db.
I might not have spotted all the problems.
Please report any db related compile problems.

Also, thanks to Pekka's excellent services I am now able to compile
and update the x86_64 I/R even faster than the IA32.
But I am still waiting for some compilation to complete.
Perhaps by this weekend we will have new I/Rs.
But I have yet to test them.

There is some confusion about linux*

What was linux is now linux-custom.
What was linux-modular is now linux.
And of course there are several linux-2.6.* spells also.
Why?
See what is listed as stable at <A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/">http://www.kernel.org/</A>
That is why.
The linux spell will provide a modular kernel for the latest available
linux kernel.
The older kernels that are still available, listed as stable and maintained
are available with modular config for the other linux-2.6.* spells.
The reason for the older kernels is because some hardware drivers
break and only work in the older kernels.
Who knows when the fixes will move forward?

The new I/Rs will come with the linux kernel pre-compiled.
It has all the drivers, experimental and stable, for fancy new hardware.
The linux kernel to install on boxes is whichever kernel the SA wants to cast.
Once a linux kernel is installed
then it will take over as the linux-kernel provider.

A few boxes might have both gcc and gcc-core installed.
Eventually those boxes should only have gcc-core installed.
They should fix themselves.
But if the box already has gcc-core installed
and the SA wants to expedite the fix
then dispelling gcc is safe after gcc-core is installed.
gcc-g++ is also good to have installed
to provide for libstdc++ for c++ sources.

Because some SAs prefer to start from a cleaner loadout
while others prefer a faster download
I am excluding xine codecs fonts and xorg related spells
from the next set of I/Rs.
That also makes them faster for me to create and check.
Compiling xorg should not be too difficult for SAs.
Figuring out what fonts to install tends to be the trickiest part.

The ati-driver-installer partially pre-compiled something or another
seems to be hopeless broke.
Even without the spell the thing segfaulted when
I tried to install it from command line.
I am not eager to rush out and buy an ATI card.
But if I was I would re-think the idea since
the NVIDIA-Linux-x86 seems to work fine.

Looks like xine might have come out on top of the video player contest.
In some cases it still might play as fast as MPlayer which is a bit trickier to
get working with fonts for subtitles since it requires a font be installed
as a file in one's home directory.
Also xine might be able to play newer .mkv formats that might
look corrupted when viewed in MPlayer.
KDE's movie player, if I remembered the name,
seems to use xine-lib.
So it should basically be a front end to xine
and have nearly the same rendering as xine-ui.

For those who like a 2D combat/exploration type game
I finally updated the crossfire spells.
I put forth extra effort to make certain that it works.
Overall it looks basically no different than older versions.
Sliding the panels apart in the client is as tricky as ever,
but necessary to see what is on the floor, inventory,
and the informational text.
