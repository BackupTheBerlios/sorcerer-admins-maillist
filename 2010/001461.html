<PRE>Ah, I use the monolithic kernel as well.

It really is faster... faster to compile, faster to run...

Saying it receives no testing is a little unfair. It just gets more
difficult to switch between linux-modular and linux with every release of
Sorcery.

I see the need for a modular kernel on an I/R, but once installed, and an SA
knows how to roll his own kernel, the overhead of making a new initramfs
seems superfluous. Also, there is less to go wrong, as there is less
complexity with a monolithic kernel.

Which kernel version, and which udev version are you using?

Did you recently &quot;tweak&quot; the kernel a bit?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also agree that the problem might be caused by
</I>&gt;<i> a Sorcerer init-script.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I tend to be more suspicious of udev.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem should be identified and properly fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if one were to circumvent it for convenience
</I>&gt;<i> then those missing device nodes could be added to
</I>&gt;<i> /lib/udev/dev/
</I>&gt;<i> Then they would be copied into /dev upon boot.
</I>&gt;<i> This is not a proper solution.
</I>&gt;<i> It merely circumvents the problem of not having
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/sd* device nodes during boot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I might actually pray for devtmpfs, <A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/330985/">http://lwn.net/Articles/330985/</A> ,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/331818/">http://lwn.net/Articles/331818/</A> , <A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/370418/">http://lwn.net/Articles/370418/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also read about the resurgence of interest in devfs or devtmpfs.
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed it does create device nodes for hardware
</I>&gt;<i> whether the driver is compiled into the kernel or loaded as a module.
</I>&gt;<i> However, devtmpfs is not in any way useful for booting
</I>&gt;<i> using a modular kernel and initramfs,
</I>&gt;<i> because something must load modules in proper order.
</I>&gt;<i> That something is udev.
</I>&gt;<i> Also udev has rules in order to give device nodes
</I>&gt;<i> proper ownership and permission.
</I>&gt;<i> devtmpfs might not have that yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could that be activated and then delete udev?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That requires more than a minute's worth of consideration.
</I>&gt;<i> I played with it briefly before and
</I>&gt;<i> then decided to stick with udev and tmpfs for /dev
</I>&gt;<i> However, I do not remember my reason for that decision,
</I>&gt;<i> and I did not write notes about the experiement.
</I>&gt;<i> I was merely curious to see what would appear in /dev/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hate udev, it sucks big time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The udev idea is great, the implementation sometimes is lacking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why, because its too much kernel version dependent, i mean, old kernel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and new udev its nogo, then new kernel and old udev, its also nogo,
</I>&gt;<i> grrrrrr.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is true.
</I>&gt;<i> As soon as a new awesome kernel feature
</I>&gt;<i> appears for more than a month
</I>&gt;<i> then udev wants to start using it.
</I>&gt;<i> And generally in the past with the bugs udev had
</I>&gt;<i> updating was often better than staying as is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The coldplug system that I created for replicating
</I>&gt;<i> the outcome of previous udev handled coldplug events
</I>&gt;<i> I created as a compromise to udev so that it could be used
</I>&gt;<i> during boot when udev is being flaky.
</I>&gt;<i> It is probably not faster than using devtmpfs
</I>&gt;<i> with a monolithic kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it can preserve proper ownership and permissions
</I>&gt;<i> and it is already tested and works on Sorcerer boxes
</I>&gt;<i> that use linux-modular with initramfs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whether devtmpfs can be used in place of udev
</I>&gt;<i> at least for monoltihic kernels requires a bit more
</I>&gt;<i> discussion and consideration.
</I>&gt;<i> If implemented incorrectly it either could block
</I>&gt;<i> linux-modular boxes from being able to boot properly
</I>&gt;<i> or it could be cast accidentally and then cause that problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Did you read anything about how node
</I>&gt;<i> ownership and permission should be maintained when
</I>&gt;<i> using the new devtmpfs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And what will your box do for hotplug events without udev?
</I>&gt;<i> Does it not have any hotplug events?
</I>&gt;<i> Can you put in a digital camera and remove it
</I>&gt;<i> or a removable SCSI style thumb stick USB memory drive?
</I>&gt;<i> Does that work properly without udev to handle the events?
