<PRE>Casting xorg-server might not install enough programs
to actually start an X desktop.
For that I recommend:

cast xorg

As for KDE-v4 that is fun.
If KDE's graphical login-in prompt is desired during boot
then edit /etc/inittab and set the default runlevel to 5
instead of 3.

For the most part Sorcerer boxes do not provide a whole lot
of confusing layers of UI between the software and the SA.
Sorcery tools are provided to assist the SA with installing software.
However, configuring software and making it run is still up to the SA.
Both gnome's gdm, KDE-v3's kdm and KDE-v4's kdm can
be installed concurrently.
However, what starts during boot depends upon how the SA
sets permissions for the init-scripts in /etc/init.d/
and also the default runlevel.

Technically, there are spells to assist with this.
But I never use those spells and so I forget their names.
Perhaps I can find one...

Okay, found one.
Apparently, I either wrote or last edited this spell in 2008.
It is called init-toggle
If you do not want to set mode 600 or 700 on init-script files
located in /etc/init.d/ manually
then this little spell will assist the SA in selecting what init-scripts
should run when a box boots.
Please try to be careful to disable execution of only the init-scripts
that are not critical for a box to boot.  :)
Yes, knowing which ones those are is a bit tricky.

Okay, I admit I created a number of convenience spells
that are hiding in the grimoire.
And they can provide a tiny little fluffy layer for assisting
the SA with trivial configuration changes.
However, for the most part manually executing chmod on a file
in /etc/init.d/ is easier, faster, and safer than
using the fluffed out method.

Now, as for error messages printed by the kernel...
Those I tend to grep in /usr/src/linux/
to see if there is more information about them there.
Also one can ask about those errors on some email
list about the linux kernel.
Also googling for an answer is sometimes useful.


&gt;&gt;<i> kernel: piix4_smbus 0000:00:07.0: SMBus base address uninitialized -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> upgrade BIOS or use force_addr-0xaddr
</I>
At first glance I am prejudiced to think that the
driver prefers that your motherboard have a newer BIOS
or that you boot using kernel parameter
or add that parameter to the module configuration.
I am uncertain what the parameter is because
force_addr-0xaddr does not look precisely correct
for a kernel parameter.
But if that is exactly what was printed
then you can give it a try.
A meaningless kernel parameter will not prevent a box
from booting or working properly.
So entering an invalid kernel parameter
is much the same as having not entered the parameter.

Most modern motherboards have a BIOS which is flashable.
That means that the ROM can be re-programed.
This tends to be much easier than the ancient method of
popping the BIOS chip out of the motherboard
and inserting a new chip.
This way motherboard makers can release products that are
partially defect due to bugs in the BIOS or in the hardware.
Then, they expect that the consumer is smart enough to be able
to visit the motherboard maker's homepage periodically
and download BIOS upgrades which fix bugs.

Is it a pain or is it a convenience?
I do not know.
However, before I buy new hardware I decide exactly what I want
then I visit the maker's homepage and download all the BIOS,
firmware, drivers, documentation and everything they have for it
before I buy the hardware.
That way I can look it over and make the final decision about
whether I want it and whether it will work as I expect.

In some cases the linux developers write drivers that
work around some of the bugs that may be present in
faulty BIOS and faulty firmware for devices.
In some cases those work-a-rounds might not be entirely effective.
Generally, updating firmware for devices
and BIOS for motherboards is the best solution.
In some cases using a motherboard with faulty BIOS
can lead to corruption on fixed disks.
The filesystem could become messed up,
or file content corrupted and lost
or the box just might lock up or reboot
for no apparent reason from time to time
Yes, bad BIOS is not something one should keep for a pet.

However, if one were to flash their motherboard accidentally
with the wrong BIOS then that might render the BIOS
completely unsuable and the motherboard unbootable.
In that situation there is not normally an undo.
And the fix must come in the form of removing the bad BIOS chip
and replacing it with a good BIOS chip.
However, some people just throw the motherboard away
and buy a new motherboard if that happens.
If the motherboard is under warranty the one could remove
the RAM, CPU, boards, etc... and send the motherboard back
to the maker for RMA replacement/repairs.

Or you can just take it to the outdoor gun range,
tie and tape it to a target post,
and blow big holes through it using a 12 gauge and .45
That tends to make me feel better. :)
But it does not really solve the immediate problem.

The error message does not seem to indicate
that the problem is dire.
But then again the driver might not bother to report
if that BIOS version has critical faults.
So if it were me
then I would visit the motherboard maker's homepage.
Then I would try to download newer BIOS
and flash the motherboard.
Yet if that was not possible
then I would try the parameter suggested by the driver.

Computer hardware can be such a bummer.
I have done enough RMAs to last a lifetime.
I even had to RMA my air mattress last month
and my air mattress is not even computerized.
