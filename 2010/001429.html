Sorcerer is an unusual first choice,
although you are not the first to start with it.
Sorcerer was designed to scratch the itch
that senior level SAs acquire
from using pre-compiled binary based distros.
Or another way of saying it would be that
Sorcerer provides SAs far more power and control
than any pre-compiled binary based distro.

Sorcerer boxes are also a bit more advanced than
package based distros.
Sorcerer boxes automatically detect when an upgrade
of an installed library will also require additional installed
software to be recompiled, relinked and re-installed,
and Sorcerer boxes do this automatically.

For SAs that have requirements for a significant amount
of software to be configured, compiled, and linked
in a very specific way
then by using Sorcerer spells they can achieve the precise
loadout and configuration of software for their boxes.
In the past only by building a box using the instructions in
the &quot;Linux From Scratch&quot; online book could a SA achieve
the amount of control that Sorcerer grants.
However, installing a box by reading and following
what is in the the &quot;Linux From Scratch&quot; book often requires
months of constant concentration and effort and by the time
all the desired software is installed, 1/4th of it is already obsolete
by newer bug-fixed available versions.

In contrast Sorcerer boxes can receive updates timely
from a grimoire, a catalog of software, tarball that is rolled daily.
Sorcerer boxes can stay on top of the constantly changing
software situation.
Additionally, Sorcerer boxes can migrate
from past to present to future
for as long as a SA is willing to update a box.
Package based distros usually require a complete re-installation
from new Install/Rescue CDs nearly every other year.
That is a very annoyingly large headache for SAs.
And it can cost downtime on production machines
unless a package based distro is installed on a new box
data from the existing production machine transported over,
and then have the old production machine replaced with the
new production machine.

In recent years computer technology and speeds have not
improved like they did in the earlier years of
80386, 80486, and 80586.
Also the amount of CPU power in a modern computer is often
overkill for the average role of any box.
Consequently, that has created an interest in virtualization
for more lucrative leasing where providers can
lease spare CPU cycles instead of entire
real systems and entire CPUs.
However, I digress.
My point is that for the role most boxes perform the demands
of the role do not usually sufficiently increase in 2 years in order
to make the hardware seem obsolete for the role.
Boxes can be expected to be deployed 5 years and longer
where often the first component that requires replacing
would be the power supply.
Also more modular computer designs like blade servers
and computers with unlockable CPU cores
can have their power augmented in order to maintain
adequate power for the role they perform.
Consequently, having an operating system for those computers
go out of date and become obsolete is a pain.

Some companies are so lazy or disinterested that they will
leave an obsolete package based distro installed on a box
rather than take it down and install a newer package based distro.
This is annoying to users, and also a potential security risk.
Some package based distros discontinue all support of a
one of their releases that is more than 1 release older than current.
Another way of putting it is that old distro release becomes
a never changing, never moving target that is ripe for attack
if anyone can spot a vulnerability in it.

With Sorcerer, Install/Rescue images
that are more than one version older than current
are considered obsolete for the use of Installing
and Rescuing Sorcerer boxes.
However, boxes that were previously installed by those CDs
are never considered obsolete if they are updated constantly.
With Sorcerer all history merges with the present and evolves
into the single future of Sorcerer.
There are no separate release branches
pre-determined to  come to a dead end in the future.

Sorcerer does not abandon the SA.
Typically, the only way a Sorcerer SA encounters significant trouble
is when the Sorcerer SA abandons updating their box and
then hopes to leap it back to current without having updated
the box for over a year.
Suddenly, they discover that the grimoire and sorcery
were compressed with xz and their box does not have xz installed.
So they must manually download xz, manually compile it,
extract the contents of sorcery and grimoire tarballs and
install those manually, etc...
In that type of hypothetical situation the Sorcerer SA caused
the problem for self by not updating a Sorcerer box timely.

The cost of the uninterrupted evolution of Sorcerer
is that the tools will change over time
Therefore boxes must keep up with these changes.
There is no problem like that with package based distros.
However, releases of package based distros
have a lifetime of about 2 years.
So take your pick.
Update no less than quarterly?
Or do a huge smacking headache of a re-install every 2 years?
I know what my choice is.

The reason for that long explanation is so that the following
statements does not make Sorcerer appear lame.
Sorcerer is designed by senior level SAs for senior level SAs.
Yes, eventually, we want to drop the skill level check down
to a point where merely experienced SAs will want to migrate
to Sorcerer.
However, there is a huge world of difference between Sorcerer
and a distribution that is designed for entirely new SAs,
or those distros specializing in noobs.  :)
Being a noob is not a bad thing.
We we all were noobs at the start.

Anyway, without wanting to make Sorcerer sound lame,
Sorcerer is not what would typically be recommended to
a someone who is new to POSIX administration.
That is not to imply that success is impossible,
but rather that there might be opportunity for many
fun challenges to overcome.
