<PRE>I have had this on my todo list for a while,
but I have been waffling about what to do about it.

Until this change I prevented kdm from restarting during updates
by hiding it's PID file in /var/run/hide/
However, this only works if I remember to hide it.  :)

Instead I have decided that the group mode should be used.
However, my choice of how to use it might not seem intuitive.

init-scripts with mode 700 are     run during boot and shutdown.
init-scripts with mode 600 are not run during boot and shutdown.
init-scripts with mode 700 are     restarted by cast following updates.
init-scripts with mode 740 are not restarted by cast following updates.

Mode 740 init-scripts are useful for services such as
/etc/init.d/kdm-v4 /etc/init.d/gdm /etc/init.d/xdm.
Sometimes restarting those services will immediately force
the end of a X session for anyone logged in.

Modes         of init-scripts are     retained across updates.
Modifications to init-scripts are not retained across updates.


cast will not install init-scripts mode 740 by default.
However, SA can change the mode of an init-script
and the new mode will be retained across updates.

A more intuitive change would have been to have init-scripts
installed mode 710 and allow SAs to remove the group
executable bit to prevent cast from restarting.
However, I do not want just anyone who belongs to group root
to be able to run an init-script,
although that probably would not work unless the init-script
had also the group read bit set which is probably since SAs
are used to typing 755 and 644 for common file modes.
Therefore, using the group mode read bit seems safest.

I considered 3 other ways to accomplish this.
However, modes are easily viewable with ls -lah;
find | grep is a simple way to determine if an init-script should be restarted;
this method does not depend on any special file system features/support;
and the modes are right there in /etc/init.d/ on the files
instead of being hidden somewhere in /etc/sorcery/log/

While not an important change
I decided to announce it on the email list
in addition to updating /etc/init.d/README
Being able to disallow cast from restarting init-scripts
is potentially useful and might go unnoticed.
I am testing the change today
therefore expect the new code
to become available sometime next week.
