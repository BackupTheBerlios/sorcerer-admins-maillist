<PRE>I believe a bit of documentation is lacking from our distrobution, and this
is my attempt to rectify that. Please use and redistribute as you see fit,
this document is hereby in the public domain.

Firstly, a car analogy:

Getting windows is like getting a car that is beautifully made, but the
bonnet is welded shut. And all the interesting bits are behind screws with
funny heads.

On the other hand, getting Linux from an outfit like Ubuntu or Suse is like
getting a car that is beautifully made with all the trimmings, and all nuts
and bolts are standard. You get an owner's manual and a free membership to a
community that owns similar cars.

Sorcerer is slightly different. You get a chassis, engine and all the spare
parts for free, each with their own manual. Basically, you get a kit-car.
Expect to painstakingly inspect each piece, figure out how it fits in the
big picture, and you build your own car. So, expect to get your hands dirty,
expect your car to blow up a few times and you won't be disappointed.

After some time you will know a LOT more about how computers actually work,
you will be able to repair ANY linux distro, and you will be able to mutter
&quot;What the hell were these fools thinking when they did foo bar&quot; under your
breath... Like any true Sorcerer. :)



In the beginning....

Computers stored stuff on punched cards, and all were happy. Progress being
what it is, we got magnetic storage in tapes and soon after that on disks,
both hard and soft. Storage areas increased exponentially, and some way of
organizing this modern babel was needed.

Enter the humble file system. A file system is nothing more than a index for
a computer to store and retrieve information effectively.

It is always a good idea to separate operating system and user data, and
with the increase in file storage size, we devised a way of getting more
than one file system on a storage device.

Enter the humble partition and partition creating tools. These days you will
be hard pressed to find a better command-line partition manager than cfdisk.


Currently (2010) ext3 is the tried and tested file system for Linux, and not
a bad place to start.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, without further ado, we can get the Sorcerer Install underway.

I assume you already have downloaded and burned to CD-ROM an ISO of the
Sorcerer Install/Rescue disk that is suited to your platform.
Put this in your CD-ROM drive, and boot from it. You might have to modify
the boot order in your computer's BIOS to do this.

Once the Sorcerer disk has completed booting, you will be dropped at a
command prompt with a short instruction on where the installer is.

Step 1.)(Initial Setup)

Run the installer, and go through the menus in order.

Step 2.)(Partitioning)
When you come to the partition disk menu, select cfdisk.

In cfdisk, you will most likely be accessing your primary hard disk as
/dev/sda

Erase all the partitions that is there, and create a primary partition of
about 30GB (30000 mb)
Mark this partition as bootable. In this example it will be /dev/sda1 ( If
you are using the older IDE interface, it will be /dev/hda1 )
Then make a partition spanning the rest of the hard disk. This will be
/dev/sda2
Write the partitions to disk.
If you deleted any windows partitions, I highly recommend a reboot at this
time. ( Windows partitions mess with the BIOS more often than not )


Step 3.)(Partition Table)

Once you are back in the Sorcerer Installer, make a partition table.
The mount point on /dev/sda1 should read: /
(/ is the UNIX shortcut for root. There is no Windows analogy for this. Root
is the highest up you can go in your system, and the rest of the world
attaches to it somehow. It's your base, and it's where the operating system
lives. )
On the file system type you should have: ext3
Leave the rest as default.
Next define the mount point for /dev/sda2
This should read: /home
All your user data goes here. Same as the other file system , choose type
ext3, leave the rest as defaults.

Step 4.)(Formatting)
Tell Sorcerer to format your partitions, and say yes to the questions about
losing your data.

Step 5.)(Mounting)
Make sure Sorcerer has mounted your partitions where you specified.
If this did not happen, something went wrong. Investigate... You might have
to go to the command line, and format/mount yourself.
You must have at least these two entries from the mount command.
/            ext3 /dev/sda1
/home   ext3 /dev/sda2


Step 6.)(Transferring Files)
Transfer the operating system to it's new root. This should be automatic via
the installer.

Step 7.)(Writing the MBR)
Now you have the oppertunity to modify the fstab ( Don't ) and run lilo. The
correct place to write the MBR to is /dev/sda

Step8.)(Unmount Filesystems)
Unmount your filesystems, and reboot. Remove the installer disk from the
CD-ROM drive.

Upon boot, you should now have the basic Sorcerer running. Connecting to a
network and Fine tuning shall be covered in another Mail.

Hmm...

Kyle, do you think it may be worth our while to make an install guide that
completely bypasses the installer script?
ie: boot I/R

cfdisk /dev/sda, (make partitions.)
mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda1 (format partitions.)
mount /dev/sda1 /media/root (Mount partitions)
cp -vpdfR /media/cd-rom /media/root (Copy the filesystem)
chroot /media/root (Change over to the new filesystem )
ldconfig (Update the config )
nano /etc/lilo.conf ( Make sure lilo is set up properly )
lilo ( Run lilo, update the MBR)
exit
umount /media/root
reboot

Also... we need a troubleshooting guide. I remember having LOTS of fun
trying to mount my CD-ROM drive because it was too slow to be recognized on
boot, and making all those nodes, etc...
