That seems bold.
There was no parallel init-script execution when I used Debian.
I would not have guessed that they would have decided
to try to make it default.


&gt;<i> Having a serial init is very useful for fine-tuning the boot process,
</I>&gt;<i> though. It is definitely something that should be available, just not

</I>
I only use the serial init-script execution runlevels.
The chaos is not worth the extra measure of speed.
When I re-designed init-scripts to be LSB compliant
by coincidence more than design I realized that
the introduction of runlevel steps allowed for
some easy parallel execution of init-scripts.

Of course first attempts at using it turned out sloppy.
Lines were not being printed entirely at once and therefore
separate lines from different init-scripts could chop
each other apart and look weird.
That aside it worked.
And the problem with chopped up lines was solved years ago.

Back in my Debian days,
debian used init-scripts written in perl.
I am uncertain if I would describe booting
as slow or as entertaining.
However, these days probably both Debian and Sorcerer
use the DASH shell for executing most init-scripts.
DASH is like BASH, but lighter and therefore bit faster to start.
There are limitations and differences between DASH and BASH.
And there are differences between Sorcerer and Debian.
But overall if both distros are sticking to a light alternative
to running init-scripts
then I expect boot speed should be similar.
At the runlevels 3 5 Debian will probably boot faster
just for having reversed definition for those run levels.
Likweise 2 and 4 will probably be faster for Sorcerer.
Yet overall I do not have much concern about it.
Someone can always come up with a faster booting method
if they are willing to make some sacrifices.

Considering how init-scripts during
sysinit are not executed in parallel
and how parallel execution of init-scripts
during runlevels can be improved
I am impelled to say that Sorcerer init design
is about providing robustness rather than speed.
However, the decision to not use lockfiles
during init-script execution
has become reason for some people
to conjecture that Sorcerer's init is
focused upon speed.
Yet looking at the 40 line script
/etc/init.d/prc
that controls the execution of init-scripts
during runlevel demonstrates that the Sorcerer
design emphasizes simplicity.
Perhaps the a more true perspective
that acknowledges all these facts
is that Sorcerer's init-design is
an attempt to make an adequate
compromise between
robustness, speed, and simplicity?
It might lack complexity and control
it certainly does not lack the ability to boot our boxes.

If not for the code for parallel execution of init-scripts
then /etc/init.d/prc could be 25 lines or less
which makes for much easier reading on a console.
To me those extra 25 lines are already a compromise
of simplicity for added speed.

Perhaps simplicity above all is most important during booting.
If booting does require debugging
then not having to have a PhD. in CS
and a day to look at sources is a greater boon
than having a wickedly fast C program
which controls init-script execution
yet is bugged up while reading
something unexpected in an init-script.

Sorcerer SAs are more skilled than an average simian
but that is no reason why the method of init-script
execution should be so complex that
an educated ape could not understand.
If we monkey around with the init-script execution method
then we might go bananas trying to figure out
why it became bugged.
Sorcerer SAs will be scratching their heads in confusion
and flinging flaming feces at Sorcerer developers for
allowing a simple single 40 line BASH script method
to be replaced by a 2000+ line C program
and assortment of other shell scripts.
Emails will read lines such as,
&#8220;It&#8217;s a madhouse! &#8230; a madhouse!&#8221;
&quot;You maniacs! You blew it up!&quot;

The two lines are movie quotes acted by Charlton Heston,
died on April 5, 2008.
Anyone in the mood to watch original
&quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; movies?
Yes, I quote old movies in my email jokes,
and I know I am the only person who thinks it is funny.
But this time the joke makes a good conjecture
for the value of simplicity.
