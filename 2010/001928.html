<PRE>While I am pounding out improvements for a new Install/Rescue image
Evert investigated my suspicions about LVM2 and wrote:

&gt;<i> I did a fresh install. The system was able to reboot just fine.
</I>&gt;<i> Then I did an augur update, and let the thing run it's course. After
</I>&gt;<i> that, the new install became unbootable because of the locked file
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i> Once I dispelled LVM2, I am once more able to boot that box.
</I>&gt;<i> Literally nothing else was done to that system.
</I>
I recommend
# chmod 600 /etc/init.d/vgchange
in order to avoid the problem or
to hold the installed version of LVM2
at the same version as provided on the Install/Rescue CD.

My guess about this problem is that
vchange is locking partitions that were initialized as &quot;physical volumes&quot;
even when those physical volumes were not added to a &quot;volume group.&quot;

In a way this is sort of like racial profiling.
If vgchange was a cop
then it would be arresting people
for looking as if they have the ability to commit a crime.
It would arrest body builders for expecting that could consume illegal steroids.
It would arrest pretty people for expecting that they could provide
prostitution.
While not the most tasteful analogy;
LVM2 is arresting devices initialized as &quot;physical volumes,&quot;
even when those devices are not part of a &quot;volume group.&quot;
A partition that was initialized by pvcreate as a &quot;physical volume&quot;
aught not to be locked during boot unless it is part of a &quot;volume group.&quot;
However, LVM2 authors seem to disagree?

The menu driven installer
on the new Install/Rescue Images
will not provide SAs with the convenience
of automatically running pvcreate on partitions.
Instead if a SA wants to create a &quot;volume group&quot;
and allocate &quot;logical volumes&quot; from it
then the SA must first select partitions to
transform into &quot;physical volumes.&quot;
Confusing?
Yes, LVM2 is a bit confusing.
Maybe an overuse of the word &quot;volume.&quot;

Progress on the new I/R is going smoothly.
I am testing many complicated installation types.
And I will be adding support for being able to
partition MDRAIDs, yes with fdisk even,
instead of having to slice them apart with LVM2
or create separate MDRAIDs for each file system.

Partitions, MDRAIDS, LVM2, LUKS, can all be used together
provided that SAs understand the order.
Disk device nodes and partition device nodes appear first.
MDRAID starts.
A MDRAID device can be created from disks and/or partition devices.
LVM2 starts next.
Therefore logical volume management can be applied
to both MDRAIDS and partitions to slice and dice.
LUKS starts after MDRAIDS and LVM2.
Because LUKS starts very late almost any device can be LUKS encrypted.
LUKS encryption can be applied to partitions, MDRAIDs, partitions of a
MDRAID device,
and LVM2's &quot;logical volumes.&quot;
Finally, the last few steps of sysinit during booting
is to check file systems and mount file systems.

After a device has a file system or swap area initialized on it
then it is complete.
So in brief the proper order to combine, slice, and dice block devices is:
Disks -&gt; Partitions -&gt; MDRAID -&gt; LVM2 -&gt; LUKS -&gt; File system or swap area.

Yes, it all makes perfect sense, but it is so easy to forget.
So some excellent diagrams will be included in the next menu driven installer.
The new menu driven installer will have two main menus.
One main menu will lack options required for MDRAID and LVM2
and some other tasks.
That is the main menu force novice mode installation.
It grants a very good probability for a new SA to make a successful
installation.

The second main menu is the expert main menu.
It has more than an eye full of menu options.
Probably only SAs wanting to do a complicated installation
that involves MDRAID, LVM2, or LUKS
will want to activate the expert mode.

On each menu is one menu option for changing the mode.
Selecting that option not only presents a query to change mode,
but also presents a nice help screen with something a bit like
a diagram in order to help remind the SA about what is doable and usable.

A discussion occurred about the boons and banes of
having an install wizard type installation process
as compared to having a menu with options in logical order.
I still do not want an install wizard type installation that
forces a SA to go through 30 pages or more
most of which would not contain information
that is relevant to the type of installation the SA wants to do.

However, as a compromise I am giving the menu driven installer
the ability to dissuade the SA from making choices that will not work.
Also the menu driven installer will try to provide some sensible defaults
It will even try to guess which partitions might be /boot / and /home
It will probably be incorrect.
So please help it by correcting those missed guesses.
So yes, visiting the fstab menu is still necessary


The current bug from LVM2 effecting some deployed Sorcerer boxes is severe.
There is not a good distribution wide fix for it since my above
recommended solution
would not work booting boxes that have file systems on &quot;logical volumes.&quot;
Regressing the installed version of LVM2 to an older version would work,
but then exactly how long would we keep it there?  Forever?
Not upgrading installed software would be bad for a distribution wide policy.
Consequently, I am encouraging all SAs
to download and burn the 20100925 Install/Rescue images
and not to use earlier Install/Rescue images.
The 20100925 Install/Rescue images will appear at:

<A HREF="http://sorcerer.silverice.org/download/iso9660/2010/">http://sorcerer.silverice.org/download/iso9660/2010/</A>

Sometime following Sat Sep 25 00:00:01 UTC 2010
As expected:
$ date -u
should print the box's idea of UTC time.
