<PRE>While I do like how grub supports loading multiple initramfs
I have not tested it to see if it actually works.
Also there are other concerns about grub
besides the expected difficulty in mapping a
correct correlation between /dev names and grub names.
Probably there would be other unanticipated problems.

Obviously, both lilo and grub have benefits that the other lacks.
I suppose a SA that still wanted some of grubby conveniences
could install grub to the MBR and
chain load lilo from the boot block of a partition.
But that still does not gain the benefit I wanted
which is to load two separate initramfs together.

On a box that is properly installed
then the main reason for lilo failing to boot
would probably be that the initramfs are messed up or incomplete.
If the initramfs images are messed up
then booting with grub would still be impossible.
With messed up initramfs booting by I/R is the only solution.

JLM, has a good observation about grub.
If we bite into that new apple we might
be chewing on some grub worms.  :)

Instead I already tried emailing some potentially
useful addresses to see who is maintaining lilo
Maybe no one is?
Lilo has no website.
The most recent releases were from early 2007
The emails I sent bounced back.
My guess is that improvements in lilo are now self-service.
But is the improvement worth the effort...

Each initramfs, except the one used for fast booting,
contains two components.
First, it contains the modules specific to the kernel being booted.
Second, it contains a selection of files from /etc /sbin /bin /lib /lib64
Basically, the first part is unique to the intiramfs for each kernel,
but the second part is common to all initramfs.
Therefore, if lilo supported loading two initramfs
then the second initramfs could be the common part.

I do not currently remember the exact figures.
But let us go with this as a hypothetical example:
$ ls -lah /boot/2.6.32.2/
total 91M
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Dec 30 01:20 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4.0K Jan  2 06:01 ..
-rw------- 1 root root  88M Jan  2 06:00 initrf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.7M Dec 30 01:19 linux
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 827K Dec 30 01:19 System.map

This initramfs is 88M
Let us conjecture that the common portion is 40M
If there are 4 kernel images in /boot with 4 initramfs images
then the common portion consumes 40M * ( 4 - 1 )
additional space.
In this case it wastes 120M
120M of waste might seem like nothing to a modern SA,
but it's still 12 times larger than my chirpy 10M fixed disk
that I had in the 80s.  :)

So does the effort to hack and debug modifications to it
merit the possibility of saving a hundred or so megabytes?
Having no experience with hacking bootloaders
and an interest in improving other Sorcerer aspects
I tend to think this might be nice, but not essential.

However, the task might not be too complicated.
I suspect lilo stores lists of blocks that should be loaded from
disk in order to load the kernel and the initramfs.
Adding support for additional initramfs might be no
more complicated than adding additional blocks
onto the list of blocks for the initramfs.
Currently, the initramfs loaded by lilo is actually
two separate cpio files concatenated.
Therefore, I conjecture that the changes to lilo source
are probably simple.
But I have not made any time to play with it.

Yet if we could have grub be more lilo like
then we could transition from lilo to grub.
If lilo development and support is dead
then eventually we might end up transitioning
to grub someday when newer kernels require
something not implemented by lilo.

But grub development was not a one way ticket to stable-ville.
Who knows what bugs we might have avoided by staying with lilo.
Lilo has provided reliable quality for Sorcerer for a decade.
Difficult to dismiss something like that?

I checked freshmeat for clues about other boot loaders.
Most are either underdeveloped or merely chainloaders.
So the best choices still seem to be lilo or grub,
unless someone has info on something better?
