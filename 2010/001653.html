<PRE>maybe this shall be the solution?
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_group">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_group</A>

I don't understand exactly what it does but in man bash in jobs command
details there is
If the -x option is supplied, jobs replaces any jobspec found in command or
args with the corresponding process group ID, and executes command passing
it args, returning its exit  status.

so instead of storing the pid in a file, I think we should store the process
group id and SIGTERM all the group then wait a timeout time and SIGKILL all
the remaining process....

I use the Process group as the notion of &quot;service&quot; for exemple the xinetd
service might spawn several process, if xinetd is killed then all thoses
process are now childs of init, then can't be stoped cleanly.... however if
we use the Process group, even if the leader is killed, all the subprocess
can be stoped cleanly because the process group id won't change!
same for gdm that can spawn several process but won't likely change the
Process group, then even if gdm itself get killed, all the orfan will keep
the Process group id.... we can then have a clean situation

for me if I do
ps -A &gt; before
/etc/init.d/someservice start
/etc/init.d/someservice stop
ps -A &gt; after
diff before after

I shall have no difference (assuming no other process have spawed something)
ie all subprocess launched by someservice shall have leaved after a stop (if
one of the subprocess remains, it can prevent to start the service again, as
it's the case for X that will detect that X:0.0 is currently running and
won't start)

best regards
JLM

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I noticed something while re-installing sorcerer and while trying to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from init(4) to init(3), most of stop command does fails
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) the pid file might contain a pid that is assigned to a process that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changed it's name (for example /etc/init.d/gdm start stop, the file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; containing the pid has the pid number of a process gdm-binary)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That might be something strange having to do with gdm.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps after a user logs out gdm quits
</I>&gt;<i> then restarts with a new PID?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) the process might have spawned a child and exited (ie the main
</I>&gt;<i> executable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is only a wrapper that spawn the real server) (I've no exemple but I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; remember something like that)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) a service that has crashed but spawned childs (who are then now
</I>&gt;<i> attached
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the init process) (exemple if you pkill -9 gdm-binary, then X that is
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; child of gdm-simple-slave remains alive)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've no solution to propose,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could quit using a PID file for gdm
</I>&gt;<i> and instead query the PID as needed.
</I>&gt;<i> That method is only good as long as processes
</I>&gt;<i> called gdm are really the gdm we expect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but is there a way to kill all a tree? ie kill the process and all it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; childs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I would not normally do that,
</I>&gt;<i> especially if the parent PID is already dead.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead I tend to use pkill.
</I>&gt;<i> Given a command such as
</I>&gt;<i> # pkill -u root &quot;^gdm$&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> That would precisely kill processes that are called exactly gdm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is there a way to assign a group id or something like that that remains
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all childs of the process? if yes we could set it, and then kill all the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process of the group....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but startup would be somewhat more complex.
</I>&gt;<i> Something would have to run before gdm
</I>&gt;<i> to switch the group to a non root group such as gdm.
</I>&gt;<i> And of course a gdm group must exist.
</I>&gt;<i> And if a gdm group exists then so should a user gdm
</I>&gt;<i> just to keep the numbers lined up.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet gdm could not run as user gdm,
</I>&gt;<i> because after someone logs in it must switch
</I>&gt;<i> to the user that logged in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, gdm is rather strange for a daemon.
</I>&gt;<i> It does not background itself.
</I>&gt;<i> Overall it is almost like a full gnome session
</I>&gt;<i> when it runs instead of merely a login manager.
</I>&gt;<i> And it does have it's own user and group.
</I>&gt;<i> killing /usr/sbin/gdm-binary
</I>&gt;<i> seems to bring it down okay or not
</I>&gt;<i> since it did not return to console.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The gdm-restart shell script is funny.
</I>&gt;<i> It check for a PID file and errors 1 if it is not found.
</I>&gt;<i> And if a PID file is found it writes &quot;Not supported&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and does not restart gdm.
</I>&gt;<i> *lol*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps the gdm authors are aware that gdm
</I>&gt;<i> is not a daemon that behaves appropriately?
</I>&gt;<i> Although gdm does not background itself
</I>&gt;<i> it does write it's own PID file.
</I>&gt;<i> If it's PID file is incorrect
</I>&gt;<i> then that would be because of a bug with gdm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The /usr/sbin/gdm-stop provided with gdm
</I>&gt;<i> basically kills off the the PID specified in gdm's PID file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm...
</I>&gt;<i> And of course there are your observations
</I>&gt;<i> about the remaining child PIDs of gdm
</I>&gt;<i> that fortunately have the UID of gdm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can avoid this problem
</I>&gt;<i> that is to say make the init-script incorrect
</I>&gt;<i> and have it kill gdm-binary and every processes
</I>&gt;<i> owned by gdm and X.
</I>&gt;<i> But that is a bit messy.
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, gdm is a bit tricky to kill off.
</I>&gt;<i> And using kill -9 does leave that
</I>&gt;<i> gdm-simple-slave alive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do you want to stop and restart gdm?
</I>&gt;<i> From the look of it gdm is not intended
</I>&gt;<i> to be stopped or restarted.
</I>&gt;<i> It does not behave like a normal daemon.
</I>&gt;<i> My guess is that it is intended to be started
</I>&gt;<i> directly by init at runlevel 5 as if gdm were a getty.
</I>&gt;<i> But that would not be possible on Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The docs differ a bit from the actual scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> For example part of the docs for gdm states
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;          &lt;command&gt;gdm-restart&lt;/command&gt; stops and restarts GDM by sending
</I>&gt;<i>          the GDM daemon a HUP signal.  This command will immediately
</I>&gt;<i> terminate
</I>&gt;<i>          all sessions and log out users currently logged in with GDM.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, the script does not do that.
</I>&gt;<i> Nor does the gdm-safe-restart
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;          &lt;command&gt;gdm-stop&lt;/command&gt; stops GDM by sending the GDM daemon
</I>&gt;<i>          a TERM signal.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> According to the docs
</I>&gt;<i> the Sorcerer init-script is doing the correct action
</I>&gt;<i> by trying to send TERM to the PID specified in gdm's PID file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was reading gdm-2.30.2/docs/C/gdm.xml
</I>&gt;<i> After a quick glance I did not notice anything
</I>&gt;<i> about gdm's configuration on Sorcerer that is
</I>&gt;<i> incorrect or faulty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My best guess is that current gdm is buggy or incomplete.
</I>&gt;<i> If the Sorcerer's gdm init-script invoked gdm-stop
</I>&gt;<i> the result would be the same.
</I>&gt;<i> I guess that sometimes gdm must be manually stopped
</I>&gt;<i> by the SA by selectively killing associated processes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While not a command I normally use
</I>&gt;<i> see the pstree command for a way to show
</I>&gt;<i> all spawned children processes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am open to suggestions for what you want to do with gdm.
