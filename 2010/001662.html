<PRE>&gt;<i> playing with SID? ;) good news!
</I>
In most situations the PID # of the session leader
becomes the SID # and stays the SID # for
all children spawned by the session leader.
Children receive their own new PID,
but retain the SID of the session leader.
It is a bit like a PPID, but not really a PPID.

So the PID of a session leader can be treated as SID.
Normally, they appear to be the same.
The problem was that I can not reliable use the quick
lock check for PIDs on SIDs.
That is because a session leader might have spawned
a replacement process that receives a new PID,
but keeps the same SID.
I can check PID files without
invoking external programs.
However, checking that a SID is valid
requires an invocation of ps and grep.

There was a problem with programs not writing PID files.
But that is no longer a problem.
I wrote a wrapper for it.
I knew how to do that for years,
but never realized that I should be using
it for init-scripts.
So basically now creating a PID/SID file
for any service is possible even if the
service does not create one itself.

And treating the PID file as a SID file
should allow me to discover if a services
is still running yet respawned itself using
a different PID.

The next problem to overcome is
to determine which services should
have PID files explicitly created
and which services will create their own.

At the moment a services that must explicitly
be started background will also have it's PID/SID file
written by init-functions.
If the process would write it's own PID file
then it might see the PID file and mistake
it is a separately running invocation of itself, maybe.
It might not expect that a correct PID file
for it would exist before the service begins.
But if that is a problem
then the PID file specified
in the init-script can use a different name
than the PID file that is created and used by the program.
That would create two PID files with the same content,
but avoid creating a problem.

I am coding this within the confines of the LSB specifications.
The specifications are a bit narrow and/or precise.
The Sorcerer init-scripts are not LSB compliant
although Sorcerer init-scripts being with LSB comments.
The Sorcerer init-scripts are better and smaller
than LSB compliant init-scripts.
However, Sorcerer can run LSB compliant init-scripts.
The Sorcerer implementation is backward compatible.
So basically I am walking a fine line
in order to enhance functionality
without breaking backward compatibility.

That is why I want to be able to properly treat
SID files and PID files and have them exist in
/var/run/ and not do something odd like creating
separate directories like /var/run/{pid,sid}/
nor files such as
/var/run/$BASE.{pid,sid}

So to summarize I am cautiously testing my assumptions
about PIDs and SIDs in order to create init-functions
that can have the benefit of using SIDs yet
have it implemented transparently and without
creating a divergence from the normal expected
LFH layout and LSB methods.

If init-functions does a bit of the wrong thing,
but achieves the correct expected outcome
then that is okay.
PIDs, SIDs, PID files, or SID files do not matter to SAs
when they want the outcome of commands such as:
# /etc/init.d/gdm status
# /etc/init.d/gdm restart
to do what they expect.
So I have no problem treating files in
/var/run/ first as PID files and second as SID files.
If it works then fine.
I do not care that the LSB and LFH say that
files in /var/run/ are just PID files.

For the most part using SIDs instead of PIDs
only has advantages for gdm.
So the extra support using SIDs and SID files
transparently in init-functions
makes the specific case of gdm
into something that can be handled as
easily as any other init-script.

The better gains for this effort are:
1. a wrapper for writing PID files.
2. modifications to sorcery
so that SIDs can be used to make the
# augur abort $SPELL
command work exactly as it should
and kill off everything the SA intends.

This goes to show how a bit of feedback to
help solve a bug involving the gdm init-script
leads to other less expected improvements in sorcery.
A little feedback can go a long way.
Thanks for participating.  :)
