<PRE>Do you like milk?
Do you like orange juice?
Ever mix them together?
I would not recommend it.

Likewise I do not recommend mixing
an x86_64 and IA32 install.
However, a box can have a x86_64 installation
of Sorcerer and still run IA32 apps.
How is that possible?
It is easy and not any different
than one would expect.

The solution is to have an IA32 installation of Sorcerer
installed in a directory and chrooted into and updated
as necessary.

Then the binary PATHs from the IA32 installation
are joined at the end of the $PATH statement.
And the the libraries containing ELF32 libraries
are joined to /etc/ld.so.conf by adding files
containing those directories within
/etc/ld.so.conf.d/

Will all ELF32 software be runnable this way?
No, there is some that might require components
that that it would expect to find somewhere under
/usr/, but be unable to find it because it was compiled
chrooted and therefore exists somewhere such as
/opt/IA32/usr/
However, much software should work okay.

Software that does not work great that way
can still work by having the SA chroot into the
IA32 install, su - to the user account
and be sure that X user cookie-auth file
or whatever it is is properly symbolic linked
so that the user in the chroot can run X11 programs.

Another possibility is if the problematic software
does not overwrite anything ELF64
then the archive from the ELF32 installation
can be extracted into the ELF64 installation.
For example that could cause an ELF32 wine
to be installed in the /usr of an ELF64 box.
It would probably work, although I have not tested it.
Of course ld.so must be able to find the required
ELF32 libraries in /etc/ld.so.conf in order to
run an ELF32.
Otherwise additional library PATHs must be specified
in a colon separated list exported as the varaible
LD_LIBRARY_PATH

As far as I know at this moment wine is
an IA32 app and not an x86_64 app.
So I am not expecting wine to compile on x86_64.

Having ELF64 libraries in lib64 directories
and ELF32 libraries in lib directories is a bit problematic.
First, many software authors do not have their software
install their ELF64 libraries into lib64 directories.
Secondly, Sorcerer, and distros like Sorcerer such as Debian,
use a preloadable library in order to track software installation.
If the preloaded library is an ELF64
then it will only work if the programs being run are ELF64.
Running an ELF64 preload with ELF32 programs invariably segfaults.
The same is true of running an ELF32 preload with ELF64 programs.

I expect that having ELF32 libraries in lib directories
and ELF64 libraries in lib64 directories is less problematic
on pre-compiled binary based distros.
Generally, software on such boxes
is not compiled in a mixed environment.
Such software can be compiled and packed on pure architectures
and then installed as packages to create a mixed architecture box.

Currently, pkg-config does not have separate directories
for storing .pc files depending upon ELF32/ELF64 architecture.
Likewise there is a similar problem for libtool .la files.

Consequently, making an installation of Sorcerer
that has both IA32 and x86_64 installed into /
is currently on the verge of impossible.
While not impossible it is clearly not worth the effort.
Separate pure installations of Sorcerer can be
installed and maintained.
And IA32 Sorcerer can be installed and maintained
in a subdirectory such as /opt/ia32/
To maintain/update it the SA would merely
have to mount --bind directories /dev /proc /sys
then chroot into /opt/ia32
of course mounting additional virtual filesystems
such as /opt/ia32/root/.sorcery would be useful
and could be accomplished after chrooting into
/opt/ia32 by running
# /etc/init.d/sorcery start
# /etc/init.d/usr_src_sorcery_tmpfs start
# /etc/init.d/tmp start

Due to the linux kernel an x86_64 kernel can run ELF32.
So the outer most installation of Sorcerer must be x86_64
However, keeping a chrooted x86_64 installation
would not be possible if the main Sorcerer installation is
IA32, because it would boot an IA32 only kernel.

I apologize if this seems a bit complicated.
I am experienced with using/updating chrooted installs
and therefore this is easy for me.
But at first it might be confusing to some SAs.

If Sorcerer IA32 is like orange juice
and Sorcerer x86_64 is like milk
then sipping from each glass alternately is possible.
But I would not advise trying to mix the content in a single glass.
Importing the archive of a single spell or two that
is normally only installed on IA32 should work.
Libraries that would exist in both installations
such as ncurses and readline should be kept
separate and specific to each installation.

Having the lines in /etc/ld.so.conf to specify
directories containing ELF32 libraries
allows /lib/ld-linux*.so to be able to select the proper
libraries to load depending upon whether the
executable being run is ELF32 or ELF64.
Having ELF64 libraries in /usr/lib64/
and ELF32 libraries in /usr/lib/
is not at all required in order to run ELF32 executables
on an ELF64 installation.
It was just a trend of convenience that
was not fully adopted by all software authors.
