Although most of the sources are all optional
the download size is insufficient to warrant
the complexity of a CD disk swap.

I would have included the sources as installed software,
but some of the spells have nice configuration menus.
Also some things like the selection of a keyboard map
are only made permanent when configured through a spell.
I could work around it, but having the spells cast is easier.

</I>
It nearly is.
But it also has some text editors.
A very minimal Sorcerer install
is still nearly 200 software projects.


&gt;<i> The rest is all optional, and might not be needed in whatever the SA has in
</I>&gt;<i> mind for the linux box.
</I>
I also discovered recently when deciding upon the final loadout
of software on some Sorcerer deployments that the default
loadout was far more than I wanted.


&gt;<i> This approach maximizes the usefulness of having sources stashed away from
</I>&gt;<i> previous or other Sorcerer installs.
</I>&gt;<i> Having a small code base makes for easy troubleshooting, quick update cycle and fast downloads.
</I>
Yup.

&gt;<i> Is it possible to have an initramfs that replicates itself onto the root
</I>&gt;<i> filesystem upon install for a seriously small Sorcerer distro?
</I>
The initramfs for the I/R differs slightly from the one created
for the freshly deployed Sorcerer box.
Important files such as those in /etc/lilo/ and /etc/fstab
are incomplete for the I/R.
That is primarily the reason for the initramfs regeneration
during sinstall prior to booting the into the box without the I/R.


&gt;<i> If gcc is needed from there, it could be stored in
</I>&gt;<i> /var/cache/archive/gcc.xz, and just unpacked with Sorcerer's tools on to the
</I>&gt;<i> newly installed root?
</I>&gt;<i> Same with the other tools that is needed for Sorcerer to perform it's
</I>&gt;<i> functions.
</I>
Not only is unarchiving the archives during installation
a convenience so that it does not happen as a necessity later,
but unarchiving all those archives ensures that that the installation
does not have holes in it.
A hole is like when some important piece of software like a library
is not installed yet some other installed software requires it.
Not having zlib installed would create a nasty hole.
In addition to wanting to avoid creating
holes in installed software loadouts,
the initramfs does not contain files
unnecessary for use during sysinit.
The initramfs lacks all of /etc/sorcery/
And even if it had /etc/sorcery/
the initramfs lacks almost all of /usr
So the software provided on the iniramfs is
truncated compared to the software installed from archives.
The important stuff from /usr is missing.

I understand what you are wanting.
Eliminate some of the replication of files
that would occur both in archives and on the initramfs
by having the content of the initramfs be more complete
and when installed software is included on the initramfs
then do not include an archive for it.
The space saved by that idea seems incommensurate
with the possible inconvenience during a rescue.
If a SA required a specific archive to fix a problem
and that archive was not on the I/R because
the software is included in the I/R's initramfs
then extracting it from the initramfs is more complicated.
Although not impossible,
the cpio command is dangerous for SAs who have not
used it before, because unlike tar, cpio will extract
archives with absolute pathnames and overwrite
files in /etc /sbin /bin if not explicitly told not to do that.
At no time should a SA have to take apart
an initramfs cpio archive in order to repair a box.

There are some files that occur both in archives
and both in the intiramfs of the I/R
However, overall it does provide for rescue
and some replication is difficult to avoid.
Kernel modules, for example, must exist
on the initramfs or the initramfs is useless.
They also should exist in the archive or
the archive is useless for rescue.
And the largest portion of replicated files
is by far the kernel modules.

While not perfectly tiny the compromise is good
for both installing and rescuing.
And the layout is not absurdly complex with
1 kernel, 1 compress cpio initramfs archive,
1 /var/cache/sources/ directory,
and 1 /var/cache/archive/ directory.
And the I/R does not require decompression
after downloading and before burning to disk.

The x86_64 I/R is now in the 190M range.
I am still trying to make it smaller without
shaving off any files.  :)
