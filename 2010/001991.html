init-scripts do not write to log files.
Most messages from init-scripts are written to stderr.
The stdout and stderr from from the function
that is running the init-scripts is piped into a log file.
Consequently, the stderr and stdout of init-scripts
that are run by that function is also piped into the log file.

&gt;<i> in pseudo code:
</I>&gt;<i> init writes the name of the next script to be called in the system log
</I>&gt;<i> init calls the script.
</I>&gt;<i> script runs
</I>&gt;<i> script writes exit status
</I>&gt;<i> init writes the name of the next script.
</I>
Writing to the system log is not useful.
The system log does not normally begin
until the system logger program starts.
The system logger program starts during run level execution.
Therefore, no system log is available while sysinit runs.

Even if a system logger was running during sysinit
and then made to re-start during run level
it might miss some logging statements and/or
mess up the log file.
The /var/log/ on the initramfs is not the same
/var/log/ on the real root file system
and therefore there would be separate
/var/log/messages files.

My opinion is that the system logger is not useful
during sysinit and not critically important during runlevel
although some messages are are go to the system log
during run level execution.


&gt;<i> So, finding hanging scripts would be a matter of finding scripts which
</I>&gt;<i> never put their exit status in the log, no?
</I>

Probably not.
What program will check exit status of init-scripts in the log
and report it to the SA?
How will the SA check it?

If an init-script during sysinit hangs
then there is no command prompt,
not even after a very long wait.
That is the idea of a hung init-script during sysinit.
After a hang the SA must reboot with rdinit=/bin/bash
and try to disable or modify the problematic init-script
so that the hang condition does not occur again.

When a hang occurs
the SA must either view what is on the screen
or switch to the virtual console that has scroll
from sysinit and then read the last line printed.

Logs are a fine way to see what happened
if the log file exists and if the SA can view the log file.
In the worst case scenario the SA only has for a clue
what was printed on the screen before the screen went blank
for full of address and register information prior when the kernel crashes.
