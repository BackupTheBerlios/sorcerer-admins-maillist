<PRE>Sorry, I have been incommunicado.
However, the answer is simple.
The huge /boot/ partition is for the convenience of SAs.

I could make the requirement of /boot/ smaller.
But I am not doing it.
And what follows is the explanation.

When Sorcerer started providing a modular kernel and modules
I made the method for only providing the modules on the initramfs
that would be required in order to mount the real root filesystem
and proceed with the start of the runlevel.
The advantage to this is that it made for a smaller initramfs.
The disadvantage is that udev's coldplug trigger had to be run twice
so that the modules and firmware that could not be loaded during sysinit
could be loaded during the runlevel.
It was a good compromise.

However, some SAs objected to the absence of a complete
collection of kernel modules on the initramfs.
A complete collection of kernel modules, stripped, and compressed
was still in excess of 30 megabytes.
That is not such a big problem since most boxes have 512M RAM or more installed.
However, if the required space on the initramfs for modules alone
would be at least 30G
then why not allocate at least that much more space to provide the
files that are in
/lib/ /lib64/ /sbin/ /bin/ /etc/  ?
And so I did.
initramfs images tend to be between 60M and 100M in size.
That is rather larger.

lilo allows up to 16 possible labels to be booted.
In theory that could be 16 * 100M of disk space used.
However, for legacy concerns Sorcerer only provides
the 4 more recently compiled kernel images and modules.
Still that could be large, and that restriction might be removed in time.

The size of the kernel, modules, and software provided in /lib64/
/lib/ /sbin/ /bin/
continues to increase gradually over time.
Also new software projects are provided that also add to those totals.
New file systems like BTRFS and OCFS2 are added that also have
their utilities installed into /lib/ /lib64/ /bin/ /sbin/
Consequently, after another 5 to 10 years the space required for /boot/
could be up to 2G in size.
2G in size is almost nothing compared to the standard half terabyte
or larger fixed-disks that come in new computers.
So making that precaution requires almost nothing from the SA
that wants to use a file system like xfs, or LVM2, or MDRAIDs,
LUKS encryption, or some method for installation that requires a
dedicated /boot/ partition.

Simple installations of Sorcerer do not require a dedicated /boot/ partition.
So in that respect /boot/ is optional for SAs that will settle for an
ext3 or ext4
for the root file system.


Now regressing back to the original question, why 2G,
and the question that would follow, why large initramfs images?
The idea for Sorcerer's large initramfs is not to provide the
minimal amount of software required for booting.
The idea for Sorcerer's large initramfs is to provide the
minimal amount of software required for the SA to
fix a problem that might happen during booting.
More simply put, there is a lot of software available
to the SA even if the box can only do sysinit
and is unable to mount the real root file system.

The fast label differs from the regular kernel image.
The fast label is incredibly tiny, sometimes only about 3M to 20M in size.
The fast label can be used to boot quickly because it has all the file on it
that were accessed on a previous boot.
However, the fast label can not be used to trouble shoot a boot problem.
The fast label is a quick blind leap.
But the labels that have the same name as a kernel version
contain a complete selection of kernel modules and also
the files from the file system that could be useful for
diagnosing and repairing problems.

As a summary, the large initramfs images provided by Sorcerer
are to maximize the amount of tools provided to the SA
in order to recognize, circumvent or fix a problem happening during boot.
Certainly, it is not enough for a SA to start an X session
and go web browsing using firefox.
But it has file system moudules, utilities
for checking, making, and mounting file systems and even more.
It even has archiving utilities like tar, gzip, bzip2, and xz.
Some SAs might be inclined to expect that it has too much.
But better to have too much than to be lacking a utility
when it is needed the most.

Short of a lilo error where the initramfs can not be loaded
then many significant problems on a Sorcerer box can be
fixed either without rebooting or just before sysinit
by issuing the kernel parameter rdinit=/bin/bash/
I know this because I recently wrote a modprobe configuration
file to blacklist the radeon driver to prevent it's kernel module switch
from blanking the screen during booting.
I saw this problem during a boot, surmised the solution, and tested it.

It is one of the benefits of knowing that the initramfs is more than a handful
of thin vine while sinking into quick sand.
It is like having a boulder to cling onto and to pull oneself onto.
It is very solid, as solid as having a very useful chunk of the real
root file system right there in memory.

And while this does cost significant space on a dedicated /boot/
The convenience is worth more than a sysinit with merely
40G of moduiles, uClibc and busybox.
That might seem like a significant compromise,
but even more so from me a SA that enjoys playing with busybox and uClibc.
In some sense booting using busybox and uClibc would be faster
and perhaps less problematic as compared to using udev during sysinit.
However, having something different for sysinit than is installed onto
the root file system and used regularly
is somewhat confusing and provides less convenience.
At the very least uClibc replacement commands do not always
support the same command line parameters as the GNU
counterparts that they are intended to replace.
Having the same familiar GNU utilities to use minimizes confusing.
.
Given how boxes have enough RAM to support using Sorcerer's large
initramfs images
the convenience is nice in that it enables Sorcerer to continue to
provide modern conveniences
while maintaining that familiar feeling and layout that SAs have
enjoyed for decades.
Sorcerer is open to this possibility because Sorcerer was late
in providing a modular kernel and initramfs method for booting.
Sorcerer with modular kernel and initramfs became available sometime
around 2007 or 2008.
Already at that time most computers had 256M or more of RAM installed.
In contrast pre-compiled binary based distros going back to year 2000 and before
that provided a method for booting a kernel with an initrd image
had to severely limit the size of the initrd image in order to be booted
on boxes with as little as 16M or 64M of RAM.
There was a time when linux boxes were bootable and runable
on as little as 4 megabytes of RAM,
which was back in the days before a getty required 1M of RAM ore more to run.

Everything was smaller in those days, especially the initrd image.
However, many SAs could escape the inconvenience by compiling
custom and somewhat monolithic kernels.
Even some of the modular kernels had both file systems and
support for either IDE or SCSI compiled directly into the kernel
instead of being provided as modules on an initrd image.
Such kernels tended to waste a bit of RAM while running
in order to enjoy greater convenience for booting.

However in contrast, the modern modular linux kernel
on a modern box has the advantage of provinding
convenient booting without wasting RAM for drivers
that are not used when the kernel is running.
The method of providing a nearly completely modular
linux kernel enables for the kernel modules be
stripped of unnecessary symbols to further reduce
the size of RAM consumes after they are loaded.
Consequently, a modular linux kernel might save
RAM as opposed to a monolithic kernel,
because in both cases only necessary drivers
are loaded, however the modular kernel's
drivers have been stripped.

So the final question is,
&quot;Is Sorcerer's larger initramfs images worthy of the space?&quot;
The answer to that question is subjective.
If a SA discovered a problem and fixed it without having to boot an
Install/Rescue CD
then the answer is that the additional space just justified it's existence then.
However, in contrast some SAs that might prefer booting an Install/Rescue
imagine to trouble-shoot or avoid a problem during booting of a box
might expect that the space for the large initramfs images is not justified.
There is not right or wrong about it.
Mostly it is a matter of preference.

Currently, there also exists the option to install a Rescue kernel and initramfs
that is taken directly from a recently provided Install/Rescue image.
This is installed in /boot/ and provides nearly as reliable an experience
as a SA would have if booting from an Install/Rescue image.
However, in the event that a booting problem is preventing lilo
from correctly loading the kernel or correctly loading the initramfs image
then such problems must be debugged by booting an Install/Rescue image.

However, for problems that are not lilo related can be debugged
with a convenience of studying exactly what is happening up to
and during the problem while booting a thick rich initramfs.
Having a useful initramfs maximizes the chances that skilled
SAs will be able to spot the problem and circumvent or fix it.
In contrast booting a rescue image instead can at best
only circumvent a problem.
However, a SA would be removed from being able to observe
and try test cases involving the actual problem happening
on recently generated initramfs images
when using a rescue kernel and rescue initramfs as provided
from an Install/Rescue CD.

So in conclusion, savings of space and speed
are not the solitary and most important concerns
about an initramfs image.
If that were so then the initramfs image would
have little more than a Swiss army knife
for booting and debugging.
Instead it has close to a full workshop of tools
for booting and debugging problems during sysinit.
And consensus seems to support the idea
that Sorcerer SAs prefer the full service treatment.
And in contrast the fast booting can shave
1 to 5 seconds off of the time required in order
to load the initramfs image.
However, in all other respects it boots nearly
at the same speed.
Consequently, when speed seems nearly the same
and size is less than 2% of the fixed disk
a minimalistic approach to booting seems less
attractive than a full service fully loaded initramfs.

Lastly, for those who might not know this...
The content of the initramfs is deleted
just a short while after it is no longer needed.
The initramfs file system remains in memory,
but it's contents are removed and thus it's
overhead to remain in RAM is insignificant.

Therefore, the Sorcerer boot method does
require a lot of RAM initially
and is slightly slow to load off of disk,
however the final stage is having a very
efficient kernel with modules loaded into RAM
and almost no space going to waste.
If a SA wants to regain a few kilobytes or
maybe half a megabyte
then the SA can also umount /etc/init.d/log.d/
after booting completes.
But overall Sorcerer makes good use of RAM
and overall is that not important?
A Sorcerer box spends less than 0.001% of it's uptime booting.
So selecting a rich and satisfying boot while completely discarding
unused components provides a lean use of memory that is
idea for the 99.99% of the time that the box is up and running.
Therefore, the large initramfs images and even
the large 2G recommended for /boot/
is not a significant waste of resources..
It might just seem strange as compared to distros
that have been providing initrd and initramfs images
for booting since earlier days when boxes did
not have a huge load out of installed RAM.

The compromises made with Sorcerer are careful.
At first they might seem strange as compared to other distros.
However, Sorcerer SAs, are not copying the methods of other distros.
They are free to perceive the costs and benefits differently, freshly
and uniquely.
Consequently, the selected compromise
might contrast greatly with what other distros are doing.
But being different is not necessarily bad.
Compromises in Sorcerer tends to favor benefits.
So when the situation becomes difficult
the benefits start to look attractive.

Sorry for the long explanation.
Even with careful examination of /boot and initrmafs images
some SAs might mis-perceive the Sorcerer method as bloat.
Yet, from a modern perspective
the initramfs that Sorcerer provides
are a practical and useful size.
Only when comparing to the installed RAM and
available disk space of computers over a decade old
can one gain the perspective that Sorcerer's use of
/boot/ and initramfs space is excessive.

If booting on a box with 128M of RAM installed
then maybe a pre-compiled binary based distribution that is
modern or somewhat obsolete might be best.
But all one has to do is rip that stick of tiny slow RAM out
and put in a 1G stick of RAM and then the box will probably
become worthy of running Sorcerer.
It is not an unreasonable compromise,
because who would want to run xorg and firefox on a computer
that only has 128M of RAM installed?
I can hardly think of worse torture for a fixed disk than
having a busy file system mounted with atimes enabled.
Either method is sufficient killing a fixed disk.
So buy the RAM and make the box worthy of Sorcerer. :)

That is not merely my advise.
That is exactly what I did to make an old pentium M laptop
worthy of running Sorcerer.
And I have no doubt that was much better than trying to make
Sorcerer bootable on configurations with insufficient RAM
to be worthy of running as a workstation or server.

So even if the Sorcerer intiramfs image can be reduced
to the 20M to 30M range the better question is, &quot;Why bother?&quot;
If Sorcerer is to be booted on boxes with 256M of RAM of more installed,
and probably 1G or more of RAM installed
then why even try to confine ourselves to minimalistic initramfs images?
