*lol*

Yeah, no breaks.  :)
If it does not break
then it does not require fixing.
Ideally, I wish it could be that way.


&gt;<i> what prevent us to have some runlevel dedicated to interactive statup? in
</I>&gt;<i> what is it not doable?
</I>
Basically, it requires that /etc/inittab also be modified.
I could try to sedit in the required line,
but that might not work because it requires an assumption
that /etc/inittab looks something like the one provided by
Sorcerer.
Sediting a heavily modified /etc/inittab might not work.
Installing a new default /etc/inittab replacing customized
/etc/initab might irritate and inconvenience SAs.

The best way to make any modification to
the selection of init-scripts run during runlevel
is to handle that at the very end of sysinit.
Only when sysinit ends do the virtual consoles gettys
become activated.
Therefore, there exists an opportunity
for one last attempt at interaction.
Once runlevels start the action is fire and forget.

And is that really so bad?
The most sensitive parts of booting
happen before runlevel execution begins.
Nothing about runlevel execution should cause the box
to enter into a state where the kernel is crashed
or login is impossible,
provided that the Linux-PAM installation was not already broke.


&gt;<i> As far as I know it's allready working when I was
</I>&gt;<i> prompted for fsck issue.... and the logs were in
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/log.d/{sysinit,runlevel.$RUNLEVEL}
</I>
fscking only happens during sysinit.
By the time runlevel begins a real root filesystem
should be mounted read/write on /
and therefore fscking should not be possible.

&gt;<i> I ask it only in a sequential runlevel.... not in parallel ones....
</I>&gt;<i> I still believe that we won't have to give up on all that you said...
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;prompt the user and then?&quot; well I'll answer &quot;have someone maybe fix it?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> from what I see now, is that we run services without control, it might work,
</I>&gt;<i> it might not work, if some service crash we have no way to fix it easely....
</I>&gt;<i> we have a fast car, without brake, and we force the driver to blind
</I>&gt;<i> himself.... good luck!
</I>
The runlevel log is far from being blind.
Since about 100 init-scripts run during runlevel
I can not read screen scroll fast enough.
If I saw some unusual red
then I check the runlevel log.

As I mentioned before an interactive runlevel requires
not only sequential foreground wrapped execution of init-scripts,
but it also requires a modification of /etc/inittab in order to delay
the startup of gettys until after runlevel execution completes.
Ideally, the way to have that is to create special debug
runlevel 7 that occurs in the /etc/inittab
before the lines for virtual consoles begin.
Ideal placement would be after si: and ca:
assuming ca: occurs before vc[1-6]:

As long as the ca: line exists in /etc/inittab
and has not moved relative to the other lines
then it could be used as an anchor point
inserting the runlevel line just below it.

&gt;<i> what prevent us to use locks?
</I>
There was no obvious gain for the cost of implementing it.

&gt;<i> for me the concept of &quot;required&quot; and &quot;started
</I>&gt;<i> before&quot; has nothing different
</I>
Ah, but it is different.
In the LSB comment section of an init-script
the Required-Start: and Should-Start:
both are used merely as tools for ordering init-scripts.
Take the /etc/init.d/lock init-script for example:

### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Required-Start: proc
# Default-Start: S 1 2 3 4 5
# Short-Description: lock mounts tmpfs on /var/lock
### END INIT INFO

Why does it have Required-Start: proc?
Must /proc be mounted in order to mount /var/lock?
Obviously there is no relationship.
Several init-scripts, especially ones that will run during sysinit,
have a Required-Start: proc
merely in order to assure that /proc
is one of the first init-scripts run during sysinit.

# ls /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S0[01]* | cat
/etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S00loopback
/etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S00media_root
/etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S00proc
/etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S01coldplug
/etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S01dev
/etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S01hostname
/etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S01lock
/etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S01loglevel
/etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S01run
/etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S01sys

On my workstation proc is not mounted first.
But it starts soon enough.

&gt;<i> this is only you that interpret it as such
</I>&gt;<i> for me that /var/locks shall be mounted tmps before starting someservice
</I>&gt;<i> means that the service somervice require service mount_locks_fs
</I>&gt;<i> for me if one service that require something to be run before it's run even
</I>&gt;<i> if it's to have a touched file (not relying on a process to be executing at
</I>&gt;<i> the same time) it require this service to be started....
</I>
That sounds fine.
However, init-scripts do not know
the difference between a Required-Start:
that is used merely for ordering
and a Required-Start: that indicates the specified
init-script or service must have executed prior and
completed successfully.

Besides...
Creating cascading auto-failures during init-script
execution is not desirable.

If lock files were created then what?
Check for them and fail entire chains of init-scripts
because an earlier init-script failed?

Not every box has networking started by
the networks init-script.
Yet the init-script for /etc/init.d/sshd
on almost every box will start something like:

#!/bin/bash

### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Required-Start: $network empty ssh-keygen run
# Required-Stop:  $network
# Default-Start: 2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop: 0 1 6
# Short-Description: sshd provides server for secure encrypted remote logins.
### END INIT INFO


So would you want to sshd to not be started if
the script specified by $network failed when it ran?
Would you want sshd to not be stopped if
the init-script that controls $networks
did not successfully stop?
Furthermore, how do init-scripts check for
a lockfile from $network
when $network specifies a generic service name
rather than a specific init-script?

Oddly enough the /etc/init.d/networks init-script
writes a locfile /var/lock/networks
That is only used to indicate for the init-script
networks that networks was previously started.


&gt;<i> I'm even more sure that we can achieve &quot;out of order stating&quot; : lauch ALL
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/ scripts in parallel without ordering and if dependencies
</I>&gt;<i> are correct, have the services unlocking themselves in the right order.....
</I>
Even init systems designed to create the illusion
of being able to start every init-script in parallel without ordering
merely start ahead of those services other services to
act as stand-ins.
There is no effective way to create a true
orderless concurrent execution of init-scripts.
Some things absolutely must happen before other thins.
Forget about trying to start them all at once
and having them unlock and run in correct order.
It would be slow for the kernel to handle
and cause wear and tear on mechanical fixed-disks
that have their heads constantly hopping all around
the disks reading bits and pieces of files that are all
being requested rather concurrently.


&gt;<i> A requ B C D E
</I>&gt;<i> B req C
</I>&gt;<i> F req E
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A &amp; B &amp; C &amp; D &amp; E &amp; F &amp;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A wait on B
</I>&gt;<i> B wait on C
</I>&gt;<i> C =&gt; free to run!
</I>&gt;<i> D =&gt; free to run!
</I>&gt;<i> E =&gt; free to run!
</I>&gt;<i> F wait on E
</I>&gt;<i> D free the lock...
</I>&gt;<i> E free the lock
</I>&gt;<i> F =&gt; free to run!
</I>&gt;<i> C free the lock...
</I>&gt;<i> B =&gt; free to run!
</I>&gt;<i> B free the lock
</I>&gt;<i> A =&gt; free to run!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> execution order C D E F B A
</I>&gt;<i> C service if failing? D E F services will be executed, B and A who depends
</I>&gt;<i> on it won't.... this is safety!
</I>
It is both slow and resource intensive.
Years ago I had a sorcery that was like that.
Instead of cast queues a spell would start to cast
in it's own process within a screen session
and it would constantly pole and wait for it's turn to go.
If 300 spells were waiting to cast
then that could be 300+ processes waking up periodically
and polling to see if their turn to run has come.

Rewriting sorcery was difficult and Evert constantly
encouraged me to find and fix all the places where
cast would cease to run while spells remained in the cast queue.
Those situations were called &quot;stalls.&quot;

Using numbers to control the execution order of init-scripts
is way better than having 100 init-scripts
doing battle with each other for the use of the CPU
while trying to figure out what should execute next.
And exactly how often should each init-script check?
Check too often and the CPU is hogged.
Check too infrequent and the CPU is idle.
Neither is good.

Having init-scripts run by number is better
because as soon as an init-script is ready to execute
then the init-script can execute.


&gt;<i> as you see I don't even have to care about numbers..... it runs as fast as
</I>&gt;<i> possible! even the sorcery parallel boot won't achieve such speed
</I>
Sorcerer's parallel boot blows away the method
you described by a measure of many seconds.

However, Sorcerer's sysinit is non parallel.
Therefore it is mostly single core
and gains only a slight benefit from SMP boxes.
However, a parallel sysinit would be undesirable.
It might save 3 seconds,
but cause chaos if anything
went wrong or out of order.
And seriously, while fscking filesystems
no other init-scripts should be executing concurrently.

What happens during runlevel start is not as critical as sysinit.
Ordering is also not nearly as important.
Therefore, more concurrent execution of init-scripts is possible.

I wish to demosntrate this in a way that makes sense.
Do ls /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/
How high do the numbers go?
S17?
Now check the S numbers for /etc/rc.d/rc4.d/
How high do the S numbers go?
S04?
S04 indicates that there are 4 steps.
All the init-scripts within a step can execute concurrently.
When they have all finished running
then all the init-scripts of the next step can begin executing concurrently.

# for ((CX=0;CX&lt;5;CX++)); do echo -n &quot;S0$CX: &quot;; ls
/etc/rc.d/rc4.d/S0$CX* | wc -l; done
S00: 15
S01: 14
S02: 10
S03: 5
S04: 3

15 init-scripts run concurrently at S00,
14 at S01,
10 at S02,
5 at S03,
and 3 at S04.

runlevel execution offers good opportunity
for parallelism.

# for ((CX=0;CX&lt;10;CX++)); do echo -n &quot;S0$CX: &quot;; ls
/etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S0$CX* | wc -l; done
S00: 3
S01: 7
S02: 2
S03: 1
S04: 3
S05: 1
S06: 5
S07: 4
S08: 2
S09: 2

In contrast the sysinit execution
offers less opportunity for concurrent execution.
Not much is lost for running them in order.
Also the order of init-scripts might not be proper
for concurrent execution of sysinit init-scripts.
Currently, there is an average of 2.4 init-scripts
run per sublevel for sysinit.
For runlevel 4 the average is 8.8 init-scripts.
And the sublevels also tend to balance load average.
sublevel 00 and sublevel 01 have many init-scripts executing,
but each is fast and simple to run.
Later sublevels contain init-scripts that tend
to start services instead of merely mounting filesystems
and loading modules.
The execution of those init-scripts is more CPU intensive.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> with such script we unsure :
</I>

&gt;<i> - all service are run in their own session leader
</I>
This can be accomplished already without
modifying any init-script.
The execution of the init-script must be wrapped
by another script that writes the $$, PID.
Also setsid must be called before a process begins.
setsid must start that new process.
An invocation of setsid can not
be merely inserted into an init-script.

&gt;<i> - killing the session leader will kill the spawned childs
</I>
Yes, already done.

&gt;<i> - the PID file is reliable
</I>
Yes the PID = Session ID if it was the leader.


&gt;<i> - services can be run out of order
</I>
Nope.
Not going to happen.
100 greedy init-scripts waking up every .01 second
to grab the CPU and check if it can start
would be a bad scenario.
Even having one process control the entire show
polling every 0.01 seconds to see which init-scripts
can be started would be a waste of CPU.

# time /lib/lsb/install_initd
Creating symbolic links to init-scripts.

real    0m2.850s
user    0m1.766s
sys     0m0.875s

That is as much time as required for a BASH script
to properly order all of the init-scripts just one time.
Assuming a C program could do it 100 times faster.
0.03 CPU seconds would be required for each run
and therefore limits the amount of times the ordering
can execute per second to about 10.
Faster than 10 per second and it hogs the CPU.
100 per second and it entirely hogs an entire CPU core.


&gt;<i> - you can even implement a timeout on starting scripts
</I>
Thankfully a timeout is not required.

Ah, I can not find the URL for it now.
Evert sent me a URL about a new system
for init-script startup that is being beta tested.
The idea is that a few services are started initially
such as a socket proxy, an automounter and a few
other services.
And then every init-script that would run for
runlevel startup can be started concurrently.
So about 4 to 8 services start sequentially at first,
and then everything else that follows can run
concurrently without waiting.
For example, even the automounter would handle
events such as mounting /var/ru
 just in time before a process could write a PID file.

The concept is cool.
The implementation is probably workable as
a technology demonstration.
But it might not be any faster than
an implementation such as Sorcerer.
To the contrary attempting to run too many
processes at once is problematic for the CPU
and for the physical fixed-disk as the competition
for CPU, RAM, and disk sectors is too intense.

I am still waiting to read a compelling list
of boons and banes for making a runlevel 7
which runs foreground, sequential, and interactively.

Also I am still thinking about how I want
an interactive sysinit to go.
I am thinking what I want /init.debug to do.
And I am writing that in my todo list.
But I have not yet begun coding it.
Would be nice if I can create an initial implementation
that exceeds expectations.  :)

If definite ideas exist about what you want it to do
then you might want to explicitly state those ideas.
Thus far I have:

initial menu for turning off init-scripts in sysinit;
while running init-scripts:
  option to interrupt execution of init-scripts after error;
  option to set next break point;
  option to open a /bin/bash shell;
after sysinit completes:
 an option to change execution status of sysinit init-scripts
 on the real root filesystem so that next normal boot
 omits execution of init-scripts that were not executed
 during the rdinit=/init.debug boot.

So basically, it does 5 things.
And it makes debugging sysinit
just a little bit faster and easier than
doing it entirely at a bash prompt.
Would this be sufficient?
