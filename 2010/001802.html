</I>
A 1G /boot is usually sufficient.
However, as SAs request and want
more and more software
then /lib /lib64 /sbin /bin will require more space
and likewise new kernel releases tend to require
more space for modules.
1G might be enough /boot to last 5 years,
maybe 10, maybe not.
2G should be plenty while still requiring
merely a fraction of the available space
on 300G to 500G fixed disks.
Better to spend a little more on /boot
than to have to repartition later.

&gt;<i> We used to get by with an 8 or 10 meg /boot - and yes, I do dye my beard
</I>&gt;<i> to keep the gray out ;)
</I>
I also remember those days.
Before switching to modular kernels with initramfs
the recommended size for /boot was about 256M or 512M.
Due to that piece of history modern Sorcerer
only uses about 4 of the 16 available lilo slots for booting.

# du -sm /boot/2.6*
100     /boot/2.6.33.4
101     /boot/2.6.34
101     /boot/2.6.34.1

The space requirements for booting are on the rise.
Used to be less than 64M per directory.
Now about 100M
64*4 = 256M
So 4 images used to fit within 256M /boot
But not now.
Hopefully, SAs that had to adjust boxes
already adjusted them.

Until the boons started to greatly outweigh the banes
I did not want Sorcerer to have
a pre-configured modular kernel.
It is a chore to update the config.
But even more so than that
the space requirements for /boot quadrupled.

But I am hooked on plug'n'pray and
the convenience of being able to easily
install Sorcerer without running utilities
to learn the hardware and browse the
kernel's menus to enable the proper drives.
That was a masochists' egg hunt
that used to be amusing.
But such a skill check is uncommon among modern distros.
And the drawback of course is having
a kernel that requires an hour or more
to compile instead of merely 5 minutes.

Sorcerer could have been on board
at the time distros used initrd,
but I still evaluated against it at that time.
Consequently, important changes happened.
Disk space became very cheap and plentiful
and installing distros from floppy disks went away.
So when I decided upon going with an initramfs
I did not have the traditional consideration of
trying to make the initramfs as small as possible.
For one, the list of modules was huge.
SAs complained if I did not include them all on the initramfs.
That alone is half the size of an initramfs.
Secondly, if the initramfs was already going to be that big
then why should I provide only a limited selection
of cut down utilities from busybox that
can just barely boot a box?
I was looking at the difference
between creating a 32M or a 64M initramfs.
So why not gather almost everything from
/bin /etc /lib /lib64 /sbin and put that in the initramfs?
That way SA have enough to do repairs,
create filesystems, or almost anything that
might be required from the initramfs.
Of course the initramfs never turns out to be as much
help as an Install/Rescue disk,
but the fully stocked initramfs is the next
best thing to a fully stocked liquor cabinet.

So wanting a full selection of modules
on an fully stocked initramfs is how
it came to be 64M.
And over time the initramfs continues growing.
Both gzip and bzip2 compressed initramfs are loadable.
LZMA compressed initramfs do not load.
I tested it.
The latest I/Rs probably have bzip2 compressed initramfs.
And that does save some space.
But on a deployed Sorcerer box
the time required to bzip2 or even gzip
4 initramfs images is not the blink of an eye.
Given that disk space can be provided
then better to just have them uncompressed.

# time gzip -1 initr
real    0m6.748s
user    0m5.941s
sys     0m0.418s

# ls -lah /boot/2.6.34.1/initrf initrf.gz
-rw------- 1 root root 91M Jul 19 16:34 /boot/2.6.34.1/initrf
-rw------- 1 root root 39M Jul 19 20:21 initrf.gz

No doubt even light compression would help,
but at the cost of about 24-30 extra seconds
in generating them to save 42% disk space.
Therefore, I rather spend the space
than trouble the SA to wait for the compression.
Later on /boot becomes tight and SAs complain
then I can introduce an option to compress initramfs images.

So currently, 1G would be enough to hold
almost 10 kernels + initramfs.
2G would be enough for 16.
But if only 4 are stored
then there is even space left over
for the SA to create a swap file if necessary.
/boot sees very little action.
fragmentation on /boot would be regrettable,
but would not cause as much of an impact as
fragmentation on /
Having 2G for /boot would not be disadvantageous
in the short or long run depending upon how the SA
uses the spare space on /boot and how fast
kernel + initramfs images grow in size.

Still the decision is up to the SA.
There is no right or wrong about it,
just compromises.
I want some speed and plenty of utilities on an initramfs.
To me that is worth the disk space.
Aside from the I/R there are almost
no space considerations concerning the initramfs.
But one can look at /etc/init.d/initramfs to
see what I filter out of the initramfs.
I shave off a few megabytes, but not much.
