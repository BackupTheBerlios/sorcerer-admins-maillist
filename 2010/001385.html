<PRE>Look as if the best method of input in X11R7.5 is moving towards evdev.
In general either the combination of
( xf86-input-keyboard + xf86-input-mouse ) should be used or
( xf86-input-evdev )
Having both installed can cause problems,
such as the right arrow and page up acting strangely.

However, that seems to be fixable..
I edited /etc/X11/xorg.conf
And I made certain sections look like this:

Section &quot;ServerLayout&quot;
    Identifier     &quot;Layout0&quot;
    Screen      0  &quot;Screen0&quot; 0 0
    InputDevice    &quot;Keyboard0&quot; &quot;CoreKeyboard&quot;
    InputDevice    &quot;Mouse0&quot; &quot;CorePointer&quot;
EndSection

Naturally, the Identifier and Screen will vary, but the two important lines
are the InputDevice lines

And for those sections I have declared:

Section &quot;InputDevice&quot;
    Identifier     &quot;Mouse0&quot;
    Driver         &quot;evdev&quot;
EndSection

Section &quot;InputDevice&quot;
    Identifier     &quot;Keyboard0&quot;
    Driver         &quot;evdev&quot;
EndSection


Yes, correct, basically, it is practically no information at all.
Why?
Because xf86-input-evdev gathers information about those devices from hal
So naturally, for this to be able to work
then hal must be installed and running.
Seems to work good on my box.
The keyboard works good the mouse works good, even the scroll wheel works.

Now that I have /etc/X11/xorg.conf properly adjusted
I was able to
# dispel --unsafe xf86-input-mouse xf86-input-keyboard
And after that I was able to restart kdm without a problem.

Now those are installed I do not have to specify
CoreKeyboard nor CorePointer in ServerLayout Section.

Having to adjust /etc/X11/xorg.conf
or even knowing that is the solution to making the keyboard
work properly and stop acting as if it is possessed is tricky.
But overall having a more plug-n-play style detection and use
of keyboard and pointers seems a bit easier.

I am adjusting xf86-input to
have a mandatory requirement on xf86-input-evdev
xf86-input-mouse and xf86-input-keyboard are optionals.
Therefore, if a SA wants to stick with the old methods,
either dispel xf86-input, which might require also dispelling xorg
since both spells are profiles.
Or xf86-input-evdev can be exiled first and then dispelled.

To help out there is an evdev manual page installed
if xf86-input-evdev is installed.
Also some parts of the xorg.conf manual page might also apply.
The evdev manual page seems a bit sparse.
And if making evdev work properly still seems to be a lost cause
then xf86-input-keyboard and xf86-input-mouse are still available,
at least for as long as the xorg team continues making releases for
them which are compatible with the overall xorg release.

Happy 2010 everyone.  :)
