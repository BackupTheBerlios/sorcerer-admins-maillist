<PRE>I completed edited the majority of spells in the grimoire.
I removed calls to url()
I removed calls to prepare_install()
I rewrote build() to install to a location specified
by the variable $DESTDIR
Whew!
Took a long time to review all those sources and make files!

Some SAs might wonder why Sorcerer was using sentinel
instead of DESTDIR for confining/tracking installation of software.
The answer is simple.
Sorcerer is such an old distribution that when Sorcerer began
no sources support installation to DESTDIR.
DESTDIR was not standard in autotools nor anything else
when Sorcerer began.
Over the years it has gradually been catching on.
Now DESTDIR has better support than bzip2ed source tarballs.
Yet not every source that supports a DESTDIR type installation
uses the variable DESTDIR.
So the implementation is not uniform.

Today almost all current sources support DESTDIR
or something like it to assist in package creation.
In the case of Sorcerer; packages are not being created.
Even so DESTDIR has some nice benefits that make
finding out what installed where easier than with sentinel.
symbolic links in directories do not have to be canonicalized.
Newer glibc can go ahead and hide the creation of hard linked files
from sentinel and any other preloadable library
and it does not matter.
Everything that should be installed goes from $DESTDIR to /
and therefore is easily tracked with an invocation of find.

Not that anyone will notice a few seconds of difference,
but software will probably compile, install, track a little bit faster now.

For the most part using DESTDIR solves more problems than it creates.
Unfortunately, there are a few obstacles I have yet to overcome.
Sources that create and install linux kernel modules, except linux sources,
often do not support DESTDIR or anything like it.
Also the spell mod-cband,
which installs an apache module
capable of limiting the bandwidth apache httpd consumes,
does not seem to have an obvious method
for transitioning the build() to using a DESTDIR style method.

Most other spells I converted.
Some very old spells I discarded from the grimoire.
And I might have successfully fixed a few spells.
Not by intention, yet indexing seems significantly faster now.

Because this is a very large change
I recommend holding off on rebuilding production boxes.
Definitely, test rebuilds on dev boxes first.
And please report problems.

The most likely problem is that a source will compile
and install files and it will disregard DESTDIR and
install files directly in / or /usr and those files and
directories will become aliens.
Fortunately, thanks to sorcery-alien finding aliens is easy.  :)
So fixing spells that install aliens should not be a terrible problem
to clean up.

Good luck.
