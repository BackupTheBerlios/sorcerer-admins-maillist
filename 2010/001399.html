Thanks.

&gt;<i> I recently grabbed Ubuntu ( don't ask), and built a virtual machine,
</I>&gt;<i> and was running old scripts I had to &quot;cat
</I>&gt;<i> $(/etc/sorcery/logs/installed/$(Package)) | cpio &quot;
</I>
If using as an initramfs
then best usually to pipe that through LC_ALL=C sort
to ensure that directories are created first.
However, I would probably use tar over cpio when possible.

&gt;<i> basically... changed a few lines to &quot; dpkg -L $(Package) | cpio &quot;, and
</I>&gt;<i> built tiny ubuntu images...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had to grab 'bash', 'coreutils', fbset, v86d, freetype (which they
</I>&gt;<i> call libfreetype6) why 6?
</I>
# augur install freetype | grep libfreetype
/usr/lib/libfreetype.la
/usr/lib/libfreetype.so
/usr/lib/libfreetype.so.6
/usr/lib/libfreetype.so.6.3.22

Probably because software authors gave it a soname of:
libfreetype.so.6

&gt;<i>&#160;and libpng (libpng1.2-0) libattr (libattr1)
</I>&gt;<i> !! 1?! why would they mangle package names.
</I>
Unlike Sorcerer boxes,
that more gracefully handle the ELF libraries,
pre-compiled binary based distros must more tightly
specify and control the installed version of libraries.

Calling freetype, freetype6 is actually a smart way to handle it.
Generally any freetype that will install a
libfreetype.so.6.xyz will be binary compatible and usable
by all software that expects to runtime link with libfreetype.so.6

Sorcerer also does something like that, but a bit less clever.
Instead of relying upon the so names of libraries
we appended part of the official version to the spell name
when it must appear as a separate spell.
For example:
gtk+ and gtk+-v1.2
All software that requires the old legacy gtk+ library
requires the gtk+-v1.2 spell.
But we could have called it gtk+1 or gtk+1.2 for example.

Fortunately, Sorcerer boxes rarely require separate spells
with nearly the same name for providing older software.
There is of course gtk+ and gtk+-v1.2 and all of the kde*-v3
and kde*-v4 type spells.
But those are not really as bad as it seems.
For example
/lib/libreadline.so.6
is installed by readline version 6.1
And when readline 7 becomes available
it will install /lib/libreadline.so.7
But the same readline spell can be used.
Therefore, there is no absurd sequence such as:
readline1, readline2, readline3, readline4, readline5, readline6, etc...
But for a pre-compiled binary based distro
all of those separate readline packages names make sense.


&gt;<i>.. SDL, lots of mangling
</I>&gt;<i> around Xorg release stuff... they do SOME case insensitive searches,
</I>&gt;<i> but tracking packages is horrible if you actually know the origin of
</I>&gt;<i> said packages....
</I>
Well, there are advantages and disadvantages to both styles.
With Sorcerer, the source tarball name usually becomes
the spell name.
That is why esound is the name of the enlightenment sound daemon
instead of libesd or esd.
Also readline is the name for readline instead of libreadline.
However, there are many spells that do begin with the word lib
and that is because their source tarball does also
such as libgnome
While it makes sense to me, the Sorcerer spell to software
project naming system is nearly opposite of what distributions
try to do.
But from my point of view pre-compiled based distros
name the packages differently than what software authors want.


&gt;<i> There is a monotone 0.45 which is a 30% performance increase over
</I>&gt;<i> 0.44, besides that I think they did some stuff...
</I>
# montone 0.45 failed compilation
# tm_posix.cpp:(.text+0x15): undefined reference to `clock_gettime'

I will recheck it since it may be caused by Botan,
but if the software fails to compile
then we wait until software authors fix it.


&gt;<i> I'm &#160;having an issue with at76_usb &#160;- it it safe to remove?
</I>
Yes.
at76-usb only compiles with older than current kernels.
It is a driver for a USB wireless network device.
In order for it to work atmel-firmware must be installed.
Then, the at76c50x_usb module for the linux kernel will
automatically be loaded if the device is present.
However, the at76c50x_usb might only work properly in
linux version 2.6.30.4
It has not worked for me in 2.6.32.x kernel versions.
Chances are that you do not have the device.

</I>&gt;<i> What timestamp is wrong that I can fix so it doesn't always regenerate

</I>
It regenerates the initramfs when regenerating it is required.
See the initrf_current() function in
/etc/init.d/initrmafs for information about what it checks.
It does not check very much in order to determine
if the initramfs should be re-generated.
Could you tell me what is changing and why please?
When it discovers that the initramfs requires regeneration
it automatically the reason why to:
/var/log/initramfs.log
After initramfs re-generation
looking at that file first might provide a clue.

&gt;<i> maybe I shoudl reboot....I appreciate your work
</I>
Reboot is only required in a new kernel was installed.
You are welcome.

Unless you know that you are using it
then you probably do not have imap or pop3 sessions
wrapped using stunnel.
I can check if it is broke.
But you may want to
# augur forget stunnel; dispel stunnel

</I>
Yes, I also am irritated by network access during compilation.
I was not carefully aware of the requirements of xfs.
I doubt that anyone would use xfs anymore.
With ample disk space almost everyone installs X11 fonts
to their fixed disk rather than requesting them across the
local network from a X Font Server, provided by xfs.
I recommend:
# augur forget xfs; dispel xfs

&gt;<i> down in building docs that I'll never read and would sooner run
</I>&gt;<i> configure with --without-docs or something.... I guess
</I>
I will try:
      opts --disable-devel-docs
But I do not know if that will convince it
to not try to run xmlto.
But there are other ways to circumvent the problem
if you absolutely require xfs.
Otherwise I will probably just put a broke attribute on it.

Thanks for the bug reports Jim.
