</I>
Traditionally, I use spell names that mimic the source tarball filename.
That is why Sorcerer has esound
instead of esd or libesd.
esound-0.2.41.tar.bz2 is the name of the source tarball
for downloading the enlightenment sound daemon.
Sometimes I create new spells
when the software author changes the name
of the source tarball.


&gt;<i> I think problem is newer DESTDIR based compile. I think Dev86 sets some
</I>&gt;<i> prefixes that it uses to wrong location, based on DESTDIR, so after we
</I>&gt;<i> install Dev86, it still assumes those are located at
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/src/sorcery/.destdir/... and so on...
</I>
I would have expected that problem also with DESTDIR
had it installed any different on the i686 test box.
Fortunately, or maybe unfortunately, it installed from a new cast
the same way it had installed on a previous cast.
I do not understand why.
But I am yet unable to correct a problem
that I can not create.



&gt;<i> lilo compile log tells me:
</I>&gt;<i> ------------8&lt;------------
</I>&gt;<i> bcc -Md -ansi -I.. -I/usr/lib/bcc/include -c -O -DHAS_VERSION_H
</I>&gt;<i> -DHAS_LIBDEVMAPPER_H -DLILO=0xbb920890 -DLCF_BDATA -DLCF_DSECS=3 -DLCF_EVMS

</I>&gt;<i> Unable to execute bcc-cpp.
</I>&gt;<i> ------------8&lt;------------
</I>
I can grep that:

# augur compile lilo | grep bcc-cpp
/usr/lib/bcc/bcc-cpp bios.c -o /tmp/$$000011730 -D__ELKS__ -D__unix__
-DL_bios_start -D__AS386_16__ -D__STANDALONE__ -D__HAS_NO_FLOATS__
-D__BCC_VERSION__=0x001011L -I/usr/lib/bcc/include -0

# augur from bcc-cpp
Dev86:/usr/lib/bcc/bcc-cpp

Also happens to be installed.
That seems useful to me.


&gt;<i> Nowdays its a default on eg. Ubuntu, which is widely used distro, also
</I>&gt;<i> Debian (Squeeze) is switching to use it too.
</I>
I am not so much concerned with whether other distros use it.
I am concerned with how it would work on Sorcerer.
So far, no support for it.
That would be a problem.


&gt;<i> Its been actively developed and maintained, which lilo nor legacy-grub is.
</I>&gt;<i> That's a default win for GRUB2 :-)
</I>
I also have surmised that the active development
on the new grub might bring it out as a winner in the long run.
But I also anticipated that probability with DESTDIR.
The support is good, but not unanimous.
The question then becomes when to switch
in order to reap the benefits and abstain the
cost from bugs and problems.
I have a high confidence when testing new versions of lilo.
That is different from udev.
And confidence in grub is yet untested.


&gt;<i> It has some features that are missing and maybe its not tested yet so much
</I>&gt;<i> as legacy-grub but you cant deny thats the road to go.
</I>
Oh, I do not deny it.
The question remains when to switch.
Better a little late than a bit too soon.
lilo still remains reliable.
And we can not have a system that has
both grub and lilo.
A choice must be made.


&gt;<i> Take a look this page: <A HREF="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2</A> it has some
</I>&gt;<i> info about it.
</I>
That is impressive.
However, I am uncertain about how much of it
is specific to additions made by Debian
above that which grub2 provides.
Cross referencing the above URL with
<A HREF="http://grub.enbug.org/Manual">http://grub.enbug.org/Manual</A>
seems to suggest that Debain maintainers
put a lot of effort into making grub work
a lot like lilo does for Sorcerer.
Even update-grub or something similar must
be run following a kernel update.


&gt;&gt;<i> It might also be a tad bit easier to mis-install it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since it does not use /dev device names.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It uses UUIDs. I think there is still some uses disk+partition scheme too,
</I>&gt;<i> which is confusing.
</I>
Not entirely.
It still uses those unusual grub designations for disks.
set root=(hd0,1)
according to <A HREF="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2</A>
And it gives 1 to the first partition instead of 0 as old grub would.

As far as I know filesystems can have UUIDs,
but disks can not.
UUIDs are not stored in the MBR of a disk?


&gt;<i> Indeed, its not a easy task to handle GRUB2 configuration scripts, because
</I>&gt;<i> if you do it wrong, your box does not boot anymore.
</I>
Yup, that would be a significant concern.


&gt;<i> Anyway, as lilo developments is kinda dead nowdays, its just matter of time
</I>&gt;<i> we have to switch some other bootloader.
</I>
I expected as much since people first started hyping grub.
However, much to my surprise lilo is still a viable alternative.


&gt;<i> One big reason is that uEFI BIOSes are coming, i mean, on server side, uEFI
</I>&gt;<i> is _standard_ nowdays, has been year ot two, atleast on IBM stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since GPT is also part of uEFI specs, you cant use LILO there, so, we are
</I>&gt;<i> actually not even supporting todays servers fully. We are using their legacy
</I>&gt;<i> boot modes nowdays.
</I>
Yeah, I tried to write some spells to help with EFI booting.
Can not find those spells now.
I vaguely recall one of them being called elilo.
Anyway, I have no experience with EFI booting
so I do not have a good idea of what is required for it to work.


&gt;<i> Legacy modes works, not a problem for now, but we are steadily making old
</I>&gt;<i> BIOS obsolete and switch over to uEFI completely and thats scenario where
</I>&gt;<i> you can't use LILO because its missing support. afaik if you have over 2TB
</I>&gt;<i> drives you need to use GPT.
</I>
Yes, a transition from lilo or improvement to lilo seems necessary.
<A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/projects/elilo">http://freshmeat.net/projects/elilo</A>
That is the freshmeat page for elilo.
Whether we can use it as a drop-in-replacement for lilo
or not on EFI boxes I do not know.
Unless someone grants me an EFI box to play with
then someone with some experience should code it.

&gt;<i> I dont have a clue what lilo does if you have
</I>&gt;<i> more than 2TB drive?
</I>
Me neither, except I do not expect that loading a kernel
or initramfs image from beyond the 1024 cylinder would be a problem.
*lol*


&gt;<i> Not saying GRUB2 works perfectly on uEFI systems, but it has GPT support,
</I>&gt;<i> LILO does not have (?).
</I>
I am clueless.

These are good questions to ask.
Even if the transition to grub2 should be fated
then who is willing to put forth the effort to make
it work as smoothly and transparently on Sorcerer
as lilo currently does?
Having used only lilo, syslinux, and isolinux for over a decade
does not grant me any great qualification.
I do not consider myself an expert in everything.  *lol*
Given a choice I am likely to continue using lilo
until SAs submit honed contributions that will
enable grub to be used instead.

Could elilo be the future of lilo on EFI enabled boxes instead of grub?
