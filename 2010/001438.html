<PRE>Doing a manual install is such a chore
that even I would not want to type in the commands.
But if that is what you want:

partition a disk
mark a bootable partition,
use ms-sys to install a bootable MBR to the disk,
create a filesystem
mount the file system
cp /etc and /dev to it
cp all of /var/cache/archive from the I/R
to /var/cache/archive on the file system
unarchive all those archives to the filesystem
create /dev /proc /home /media /media/root /sys /root /tmp
and other directories within the filesystem and give them
appropriate permissions.
copy /etc/skel/ to /root in the filesystem so that root gains
the usual benefits of logging in
mount --bind /dev /proc to their places in the filesystem
Chroot into the filesystem
run ldconfig
edit /etc/lilo* as necessary
edit /etc/fstab as necessary
execute:
/etc/init.d/depmod
/etc/init.d/services.d
/etc/init.d/rc.d
/etc/init.d/lilo.conf
/etc/init.d/initramfs
cd to /etc/networks.d/
do what is required to set up networking,
break the chroot,
unmount bound filesystems,
unmount the filesystem,
reboot,
adjust BIOS/CMOS to boot from fixed disk instead of CDROM,
boot the newly installed Sorcerer,
start updating the box,
complete updating it,
start adding new software.

Please forgive me if I accidentally omitted a few steps.
It is not so much complex as it is tedious.
And the above example is just for a single partition install.

If the menu driven installer breaks
then the SA must already know how to do a manual install
and have some experience with doing manual installs.
Otherwise no pile of docs is going to help
as they brick their shorts and rip out lose hairs.

Being able to do a manual install is
a step up in skill from that of the average SA.
Probably anyone who is not already a senior level SA
who is attempting to manually install Sorcerer has
at best a 5% chance of increasing their probability of success
with the help of documentation.
But they might just end up with a box that prints
LI
and is unable to continue booting.

By far hacking bugs out of the install script as needed
is easier than doing a manual installation.
It is one of the reasons that the installer is a shell script.
However, it has not had a bug that SAs had to
sedit or edit out of it since maybe 2007 or 2008,
not in years at least.

I have good confidence in the current I/R menu driven installer.
It is not broke.
However, there may be errors that only manifest
within certain machine emulation programs.
I know for example that qemu versions 0.12.1 has
some serious bugs,
bugs that cause programs to segfault,
and I have not yet made time to
extensively test qemu version 0.12.2
However, I have confidence in qemu version 0.11.1

Experiencing segfaults and compilation failures
while trying to update the x86_64 I/R image
while running qemu version 0.12.1
does not indicate that a bug exists in cast,
or a bug in coreutils, or a bug in grep.
No, I recognize that the actual cause of the problem
are bugs in qemu version 0.12.1

If someone wants to report a bug that is definitely
within the menu driven installer
then the bug report should _not_ be as follows,

&quot;Because a problem occurred while using the menu driven installer
I have concluded that there is a bug within the menu driven installer.&quot;

That conclusion is spurious.
Until one knows exactly what failed and why
and have eliminated other possibilities such as
a problem with the virtual machine emulator
then all we know is the first statement which is,
&quot;Something unusual that became a problem
occurred while running the menu driven installer.&quot;
That much we can normally trust is a valid observation.

Recently, someone told me that
libical has an absolute requirement on libidn.
He stated the reason for that conclusion was because
when libical and libidn cast at the same time libical will fail.

So I investigated this.
I grepped libical's source.
Nothing about it suggests libidn is used nor required.
Also it does not link with libidn when libidn is installed.

What I discovered was that libical compiles using cmake
and cmake links with libidn.
I suspect that during the upgrade of libidn
for tiny fraction of a second cmake became unable to run
because ld.so does not yet know libidn's libraries have
moved to a different location.
That is probably what caused libical's compile failure.

Therefore, the proper solution to the problem
was to make libidn a solo spell so that no other
spells compile while libidn is compiling.
That entirely avoids the original problem.

But my point in stating the above to show
that an untested assumption based upon an observation
can lead to a spurious conclusion.
While something undesirable happened
while running the menu driven installer,
and it created a problem,
that does not necessarily mean that there is
a bug in the menu driven installer.
Hmmm, maybe that above sentence is confusing.
Let me try to word it differently.
Yes a problem occurred while running the menu driven installer.
No that does not necessarily mean that the cause of
the problem is improper code in the menu driven installer.
The cause of the problem must be investigated
and not merely assumed.

Without a thorough investigation to find out
exactly what failed and why
then to guess that the cause is a bug in the installer
is merely a guess.
A guess is a fine place to start,
but all guesses must be checked out
so that only the verifiable truth remains.

I would love to fix the problem.
All I have to do is make the bug happen while I am using it.
If I can see it then I can analyze it and fix it.
But since it is not happening for me,
I at the mercy of whatever information is provided to me.
So if you want a good fix
please provide good information.  :)

I am not denying that there was a problem.
I merely want to know more about it,
such as what caused it and what can be done about it.

Unlike Sorcerer boxes,
which have individual loadouts of installed software,
the Sorcerer I/Rs are the same no matter who uses them.
Consequently, we should be having a consistently failed
experience if a bug exists in the functions used by the fstab menu
in the menu driven installer.
Since it works for me, that is as much as I can do about it.
The next steps is for someone who has the problem
to thoroughly investigate it,
and also for others to try to replicate it.
There more people who can encounter the problem and analyze it
then the better the fix aught to be.  :)

If I could generate the problem
then I would fix it immediately and
try to have new I/Rs rolled and tested
before the weekend is done.
Both of the I/R working directories are up to date,
and so the only reason I am not releasing a new I/R
at the moment is because I want to improve the
menu driven installer and create a dialog tutorial script.
But if there was a bug in the current menu driven installer
and I could trigger it
then I would be able to release fixes for it very soon.

So please pile up your information and hunt down this bug.
It probably is not in the installer,
but once the cause of the bug is discovered
then there might be changes that can be made to
the installer in order to circumvent the bug.

Such an expectation would be consistent with improvements
made to the script to detect the sorcerer I/R CD even when
it is installed in old buggy CDROMs that tend to immediately
and repeatedly fail mount attempts while the CDROM is
slowly spinning up to speed.

But if the virtual machine emulator is the cause of the problem
then the only work-around possible might be a warning.
I could post in the welcome message that attempts to
install Sorcerer using the menu driven installer within
such and such VM version such and such will fail.
Sometimes a warning is as much as can be done
when I can not take ownership of the problem
nor provide a solution.

Go hunt please.
And when you bring back a bug strapped to a pole
then I will thoroughly roast it for you.
