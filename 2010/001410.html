Hi there, Nathan.

It's nice to see people join Sorcerer. To  be honest with you, installing
Sorcerer is not one of the easiest tasks as once Sorcerer is installed it
tends to stay that way. I install Sorcerer quite often, and the last time I
did a fresh install was about a year ago.

Nevertheless, I would like to help. Can you describe to me where it is that
you are getting stuck?

Sorcerer install can basically be broken up into a few seperate steps.

1. Sorcerer I/R disk boots, and gives you a prompt.
2. The installer is excuted.
3. Partitions are made
4. Files are transferred
5. MBR is updated ( optional )
6. Reboot into Sorcerer.


Can you describe to me which one of these is giving you a problem, please?

I have been considering feedback from SAs
who have attempted to install Sorcerer,
yet did not quite accomplish the task.
Frequently, there is the report
that goes something like,
&quot;It ran out of memory and killed the menu driven installer.&quot;

My best guess about this is that SAs are either not
specifying a &quot;/&quot; root filesystem in the fstab menu,
or not mounting it, or not initializing it before mounting.
If a root filesystem on a physical storage device such as a
fixed disk or USB memory stick is not mounted on
/media/root/
then the install script will attempt to do the installation
to the initramfs/rootfs filesystem which is memory.
This is not desirable.

Now I wrote above that a real filesystem must be mounted
on /media/root
However, the SA does not have to do this manually.
The menu driven installer will be able to do this.
And in most cases the menu driven installer should do this,
rather than the SA.

For a filesystem to be created on a device
the device must first have partitions.
If the fixed disk is not partitioned
then select partitioning from the menu,
I prefer fdisk, and carve out at least one partition.

Even a partition exists on a disk
that partition is not suitable for mounting unless
a filesystem exists on that partition.

In the sorcery's fstab creation menu
that partition should be offered as an entry.
Select it.
Specify that it should be mounted as /
because every box must have a / filesystem.
That is the root filesystem.
Now specify a filesystem for /
In the past I tended to use ext3.
But for testing I use ext4.
Either ext3 or ext4 are good choices.
Once those are entered for that partition
then that is enough information for the menu
driven installer to handle that partition.

I do not recommend installing Sorcerer onto a
filesystem that already has something else installed.
In some cases a SA could manually do this by avoiding
the filesystem initialization menu.
A SA would want to do this if the SA wants to manually
remove everything from that partition except /home/
and has already done so before using the sorcery
menu driven installer.

In the past distributions recommended /home/ be kept
on a separate partition to avoid having to wipe it
while doing a complete re-install of the operating system
that was required every year or two.
However, that has never been a requirement with Sorcerer.
Sorcerer can be installed once and updated forever
as long as those updates are no further than 3 months apart.
Longer jumps run greater risks of encountering
an unexpected problem that the SA would have to manually solve.
However, I digressed.
Sorry.

Please visit the filesystem initialization menu
and select that new partition for initialization.
If a partition does not have a filessystem
then the partition can no be mounted.
So this is an important step.

the menu driven installer will know what partitions
to offer for possible initialization and also what filesystem
to create if the partition is to be initialized.
To be specific the word initialization in this context
means to create a filesystem.

Finally, now that there is a root filesystem
then the mount menu can be visited and
the root filesystem will be mounted as /media/root
After that is successful
then the install menu can be visited.
The menu driven installer will now quickly copy files
to the real root filesystem and extract them.
In qemu this step requires some time.
But on real hardware it is considerably fast.
Still there should be enough time to refill one's
orange juice glass and look for a rainbow outside.

After files are installed
there is merely one more step in order for it to become bootable.
Visit the compile menu.
This one will present many menus that ask questions.
At least selecting default locales will expedite compilation,
because creating a complete set of locales is time consuming
and also wastes about 30M or more megabytes of disk space.
The etc spell can be recast later for the convenience
of being reminded which files in /etc the SA should edit.

After compilation is complete
then the box is ready to reboot.
After booting from fixed disk,
naturally, set a root password,
give the box a name,
set the system and hardware clock date/time,
and finally configure the network by reading files
in /etc/networks.d/ and copying and modifying a template
that describes the network type.
Or if you are feeling lazy and have a DHCP server
then type something like
dhcpcd eth0
to obtain an instant IP address for the eth0 device.
Network configuration is the most manual aspect of
installing a Sorcerer box.

Now that is all done the Sorcerer box is ready
for updating and deploying with the software
required for mission critical operation.
I recommend that this be done in 2 steps.
First, update the box.
# augur easy

Software changes so quickly that half the software
on installed by an I/R is already obsolete by the time
that you receive it.
So having about 100 spells recast is not atypical.

Now that is done the exact mission critical spells to
install on the box can be selected using sorcery or
instead issued as command line parameters to cast.
Figuring out what to installs, if doing it by command line,
is best done with some assistance from augur.
The augur utility has some useful commands for searching
the catalog of available software by keyword, category, attribute.

Sorcerer's catalog of software, also called a grimoire,
has about 3000+ entries in it.
Yes, that does not seem like much compared to a
pre-compiled binary based distro,
but that is because Sorcerer does not chop sources
into -dev packages, -lib packages, -exe packages,
nor does it chop something like coreutils into a bazillaion
smaller package for each of the utilities installed.
With Sorcerer, entire sources are compiled and installed.
Each Sorcerer box can be used for software development.
So what would seem like 12000 or more packages in
a pre-compiled binary based distro only amounts to about
3000 spells in Sorcerer.
In my opinion having fewer spells is less of a brain strain
on SAs for selecting software to install,
yet at the same time receiving much of the same high
quality software provided by other distros.

Installing something like kde-v4 is very simple.
cast kde-v4
gnome is equally simple.
cast gnome

After the optional and switch menus are visited during cast
the rest of the process involving the downloading,
compilation, and installation of software is automatic
and happens in the background at nice 15.
There is no need to wait upon it.
Also additional software can be selected for casting
and added to the cast queue.
sorcery will install the software in the proper order,
and often use multiple CPU cores to compile software
concurrently for faster installation.
This behavior can be set using the CAST_RATE variable
which can be set somewhere under one of sorcery's
configuration menu when the sorcery tool is invoked.

Installing kde-v4 or kde-v3 requires a long time to completion.
However, most other software,
excluding linux-modular and firefox,
installs very fast on box.
The process of waiting for software to install might require
between 30 minutes or several hours depending upon the
load that the SA requested.
This is referred to as the &quot;big wait&quot;
During this time logging out is fine,
just leave the computer on and connected to a network
so that it can complete installation of software.
Since this time is entirely non-interactive
it requires no SA attention.

The &quot;big wait&quot; both that happens during the final deployment
of sorcerer and when updating sorcerer boxes
is the one significant drawback
that is common to source based distros.
Having software compiled for optimal performance
actually requires some time to compile it.

However, the &quot;big wait&quot; is not a big factor in the long run.
During updates a box does not have to be reduced to runlevel 1.
Boxes can be updated while users are logged in
and while services are being provided.
Services will restart as necessary to start running the
newer software once the newer software is installed.
And because updating happens in the background at nice 15
a box is still available for hard work, or watching videos,
or even playing video games while it is updating.
The high nice value tells the kernel to provide cast with
CPU cycles that would otherwise be idle or wasted.
So if nothing heavy is running on the box,
besides the casting of spells,
then updates will happen quickly.
If updating while watching video
then the update will require a bit longer to complete
than if nearly all CPU cycles could be granted to cast.

Please keep in mind that sometime during an update of
gnome or kde-v3 or kde-v4 that the GUI login manager
will be restarted which will probably abruptly end the X
session of any user that is logged in during that time.
Sorry about that.
Hiding the pid for kdm or gdm which is normally in
/var/run/ within a subdirectory called hide
will normally keep those from restarting.

Other ways to avoid inconveniencing users is to schedule
updates by cronjobs that happen during night hours.
At many workplaces workstations are left on during night
and idle the CPU for nearly 14 hours.
Those are awesome times for updating.

Now for the final recommendation.
Each Sorcerer box is unique because it can have a load out
of software on it that might not exist anywhere else.
Consequently, very rarely a problem will occur on a box
that has a very specific load out of software.
And that problem might not occur on my test box during testing.
So I could be unaware of it.
There was a problem like that a long time ago where
maybe db failed to compile if emacs was installed.
Or it was something like that where something failed to compile
because something else was installed.
Consequently, better to stay ahead of breakage
than to have it bust down upon your head.
The way to stay ahead of breaks is to have a box
deployed that is merely for testing, called the &quot;dev&quot; box.
Update the dev box before updating any production boxes.
That way if a problem could happen on the production boxes
then it will first happen on the dev box.

If both the dev box and production boxes are on automatic updates
then the dev box can be given a LAG=3D0 while the production boxes
are given LAG=3D7 in order to create a week's worth of separation.
This way problems will occur on the dev box a week ahead
of when they would occur on the production box.
That gives a SA time to spot a problem and interdict before
it becomes a problem on a production box.

However, using high LAG values on production boxes means
that software updates for both bug fixes and security problems
will occur that much slower than when they become available
in the LAG=3D0 grimoire.
Alas, there is no perfect solution for this.
By default Sorcerer boxes have LAG=3D1
which is useful if the SA was able to set the
date/time for the box, but was unable to do so
so that the box knows what the correct UTC date/time is.
That could happen for example if the box is dual booted
with a windoze operating system that stores date internally
in localtime instead of UTC time.

Probably, after having one or two
successful installations of Sorcerer
then using the menu driven installer
will seem less of an ordeal.
At the moment the menu driven installer
merely simplifies the steps of installation
by invoking required commands with proper parameters.
This is helpful since a SA would not actually have to know
the name of the utility for creating a filesystem or the
parameters to pass to it.
However, the steps involved in installation are not strictly
enforced by the menu driven installer.
Therefore, the SA must be aware of the general path
that one must travel in order to install a POSIX.

After mastering the menu driven installer
perhaps try attempting a manual install that does not
involve using the menu driven installer.
Yes, it is possible.
And doing so will gain confidence in one's knowledge
of how the pieces of a POSIX fit together.

Compared to what used to by required in order to manually
install Debian more than a decade ago, Sorcerer is a bit
more difficult to manually install.
But it involves creating a partition, a filesystem, copying files,
unarchiving tarballs, editing lilo.conf.head
and then running many of the scripts in
/etc/init.d/ in order to handle the tedious things like
generating the sysvinit /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/* symbolic links,
creating the initramfs, installing lilo, etc...

Sorcerer is actually even a bit gentle to the SA that
tries to do a manual install assuming the attempt is
nearly perfect.
For example if a root partition is not specified in /etc/fstab
then there is a menu that appears during sysinit that allows
the SA to specify which partition to mount as the root partition.
But even so, eventually /etc/fstab should be properly edited
to include a root partition.
But not having it that way will not block a box from booting
if the SA is willing to assist.

Another method might be to try to do the manual install,
then fail to be able to boot the box,
so then boot using the I/R
and select the fixed disk partition for the root filesystem.
Now it is loaded, but not yet complete.
Check /etc/lilo.conf.head and /etc/fstab and make corrections.
Now run /etc/init.d/rc.d.
Finally, shutdown -r
At this point the shutdown scripts will run that will do the
necessary things like creating an initramfs and installing lilo and such.
And if it is sufficient then the box will be bootable from fixed disk.

The menu driven installer is a big help to SAs
for being able to install a box quickly for very little SA attention.
Basically, just by pressing arrow keys, space and enter
and pressing / at one point
is all that is required to go through the menu driven installer
after invoking it with sinstall.  :)

That said, however you want to install Sorcerer is
properly the correct method as long as it is bootable
after installation.  :)
After creating one Sorcerer box you might want to
create a chrooted install to use as a template for new boxes.
That way new boxes can be installed by booting from an I/R,
creating a filesytem, starting the network,
scping a compressed tarball,
and then uncompressing it.
Other SAs might temporarily install a disk in a removable drive bay
and then hot plug it into a Sorcerer box and then do the installation
to the removable from the already deployed box.
By this method installing without an CD drive is possible.

Rumor has it that a USB memory drive can be ruined by
dding a bootable CD image, such as Sorcerer's I/R,
to the USB memory drive's device.
According to rumor the USB memory drive then acts as
if it is a bootable detachable CD device.
But once written that way the change can not be undone.
But $10 or less for a USB thumb drive is cheaper
than buying an optical disk drive and also tends to
be faster than installing from CD.
Also most computers created during 2004 or later
are capable of booting from a USB device.
Groovy.  :)

My advice is to keep trying with the installation.
One a person's understanding of the steps required
for installation is complete
then there is practically no way to mess it up.
Failure to achieve an installed Sorcerer box
while using the menu driven installer is usually
due to a SA skipping an important step.
Therefore, be careful.
If a menu is marked as optional,
but you might be uncertain about what it does
then visit that menu and see what it says.

Yes, initializing a filesystem is optional if an
initialized filesystem already exists.
But if it does not already exist
then that menu is not optional.  :)
Maybe that is strange logic for the use
of the word optional.
But the word optional does mean that in some cases
where the SA has already done that step previously
then installation is possible without visiting an optional menu.
For example, when installing Sorcerer on a disk while overwriting
some other operating system then the disk is already partitioned
and therefore visiting the partitioning menu is optional.
However, in order to re-use a partition
then the filesystem initialization menu should be visited
in order to create a new empty filesystem on an existing partition.

After some consideration I am guessing that the use of
the word &quot;optional&quot; is confusing in the context of the menu
driven installer, because the SA must know why a menu
is optional in order to determine if the menu should be visited.

I must consider this in detail to determine how to help SAs
make better choices about skipping optional menus.
I can not simply force SAs to initialize every partition that
is specified in in the fstab menu,
because that could lead to unwanted data loss.
So, maybe I can give SAs some second chance
at skipped optional menus without forcing them
to do them?

Obviously, the in this respect the menu driven installer
is not buggy, but for SAs very new to Sorcerer
the use of the word &quot;optional&quot; is confusing
and perhaps misleading?

Creating a menu driven installer that is lose enough
for senior level SAs to make it do what they want,
yet tight enough to keep new SAs from falling through
the cracks is difficult.
Ultimately, the menu driven installer should be an experience
that is survivable without the use of external documentation
in order to properly navigate the menus.
The use of Sorcerer should be a positive successful
hands-on experience where there is no reading 300 pages
of documentation before unwrapping the CD.
Obviously, the menu driven installer is not there yet.
But you will probably enjoy augur's help,
both the help menu and
the verbose help available on each augur parameter.

Hi there, Nathan.

Ok, so you got to the 3 step, and stuck there.

On the command line, issue:
man cfdisk
and read a little about what partitions are, and how to create them.

I do have a couple of questions for you, though.

Are you going to try and dual boot after this Sorcerer installation, or is
this the only OS on the computer?

If you are going to dual boot, I sure hope you have a backup of your windows
stuff.
In the case of dual booting, I would suggest backing up everything you find
important, then re-installing windows, but taking care to limit it's disk
usage by erasing it's partition off the disk, and then making a 10GB
partition and installing it into there.

Then, I would read the lilo manual on how to do a successful dual boot.
Again, this is not something I have done in a few years.

If, on the other hand, Sorcerer is the only operating system that you are
going to install, things are a LOT simpler.

Here is a short explanation of what is happening. ( For longer explanations,
wikipedia and google are your friends )

Any computer stores files in a a filesystem. Traditionally file systems go
on to devices, like hard drives and so on.
However, you might want to have two or more filesystems on a disk for
various reasons. In order to do this, you have to subdivide your device....
with partitions.

ie:
Say your hard disk is called /dev/sda
It IS possible to create a filesystem on there that spans the whole thing,
but this is almost universally NOT recommended.

So, you would pop into a program like cfdisk ( just type cfdisk at a command
prompt, and hit enter )
and in there you would see your hard disk.

For a one-filesystem install of Sorcerer I would not try it in less than
20GB, and 30GB is recommended.
So, create a partition at the beginning of your disk of about 30GB
This partition will be called /dev/sda1 from now on...
Make the rest of your hard disk into /dev/sda2 ( just make another
filesystem that fills the rest of the disk. )

Now, in the Sorcerer install menu you can specify in the partition table
that:
 /dev/sda1 mounts on /
and
/dev/sda2 mounts on /home

Here / means root, and a root filesystem is any filesystem that mounts on /
( root )

I hope this gets you further along in the install.

However, I have a little word of advice for you. We are not mind-readers,
and find it really difficult to help someone without a description of the
problem.

We would find it very helpful of you could add a short description of the
steps you took to get to where you are stuck.
Also, I find it useful to have a pen-and-paper book open next to a computer
that I am installing, so that I can write down what is happening, and
parameters and so on.

Lastly, Good Luck!

-Evert-

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been considering feedback from SAs
</I>&gt;<i> who have attempted to install Sorcerer,
</I>&gt;<i> yet did not quite accomplish the task.
</I>&gt;<i> Frequently, there is the report
</I>&gt;<i> that goes something like,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It ran out of memory and killed the menu driven installer.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My best guess about this is that SAs are either not
</I>&gt;<i> specifying a &quot;/&quot; root filesystem in the fstab menu,
</I>&gt;<i> or not mounting it, or not initializing it before mounting.
</I>&gt;<i> If a root filesystem on a physical storage device such as a
</I>&gt;<i> fixed disk or USB memory stick is not mounted on
</I>&gt;<i> /media/root/
</I>&gt;<i> then the install script will attempt to do the installation
</I>&gt;<i> to the initramfs/rootfs filesystem which is memory.
</I>&gt;<i> This is not desirable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now I wrote above that a real filesystem must be mounted
</I>&gt;<i> on /media/root
</I>&gt;<i> However, the SA does not have to do this manually.
</I>&gt;<i> The menu driven installer will be able to do this.
</I>&gt;<i> And in most cases the menu driven installer should do this,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than the SA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For a filesystem to be created on a device
</I>&gt;<i> the device must first have partitions.
</I>&gt;<i> If the fixed disk is not partitioned
</I>&gt;<i> then select partitioning from the menu,
</I>&gt;<i> I prefer fdisk, and carve out at least one partition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even a partition exists on a disk
</I>&gt;<i> that partition is not suitable for mounting unless
</I>&gt;<i> a filesystem exists on that partition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the sorcery's fstab creation menu
</I>&gt;<i> that partition should be offered as an entry.
</I>&gt;<i> Select it.
</I>&gt;<i> Specify that it should be mounted as /
</I>&gt;<i> because every box must have a / filesystem.
</I>&gt;<i> That is the root filesystem.
</I>&gt;<i> Now specify a filesystem for /
</I>&gt;<i> In the past I tended to use ext3.
</I>&gt;<i> But for testing I use ext4.
</I>&gt;<i> Either ext3 or ext4 are good choices.
</I>&gt;<i> Once those are entered for that partition
</I>&gt;<i> then that is enough information for the menu
</I>&gt;<i> driven installer to handle that partition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not recommend installing Sorcerer onto a
</I>&gt;<i> filesystem that already has something else installed.
</I>&gt;<i> In some cases a SA could manually do this by avoiding
</I>&gt;<i> the filesystem initialization menu.
</I>&gt;<i> A SA would want to do this if the SA wants to manually
</I>&gt;<i> remove everything from that partition except /home/
</I>&gt;<i> and has already done so before using the sorcery
</I>&gt;<i> menu driven installer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the past distributions recommended /home/ be kept
</I>&gt;<i> on a separate partition to avoid having to wipe it
</I>&gt;<i> while doing a complete re-install of the operating system
</I>&gt;<i> that was required every year or two.
</I>&gt;<i> However, that has never been a requirement with Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer can be installed once and updated forever
</I>&gt;<i> as long as those updates are no further than 3 months apart.
</I>&gt;<i> Longer jumps run greater risks of encountering
</I>&gt;<i> an unexpected problem that the SA would have to manually solve.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I digressed.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please visit the filesystem initialization menu
</I>&gt;<i> and select that new partition for initialization.
</I>&gt;<i> If a partition does not have a filessystem
</I>&gt;<i> then the partition can no be mounted.
</I>&gt;<i> So this is an important step.

</I>&gt;<i> the root filesystem will be mounted as /media/root
</I>&gt;<i> After that is successful
</I>&gt;<i> then the install menu can be visited.
</I>&gt;<i> The menu driven installer will now quickly copy files
</I>&gt;<i> to the real root filesystem and extract them.
</I>&gt;<i> In qemu this step requires some time.
</I>&gt;<i> But on real hardware it is considerably fast.
</I>&gt;<i> Still there should be enough time to refill one's
</I>&gt;<i> orange juice glass and look for a rainbow outside.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After files are installed
</I>&gt;<i> there is merely one more step in order for it to become bootable.
</I>&gt;<i> Visit the compile menu.
</I>&gt;<i> This one will present many menus that ask questions.
</I>&gt;<i> At least selecting default locales will expedite compilation,
</I>&gt;<i> because creating a complete set of locales is time consuming
</I>&gt;<i> and also wastes about 30M or more megabytes of disk space.
</I>&gt;<i> The etc spell can be recast later for the convenience
</I>&gt;<i> of being reminded which files in /etc the SA should edit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After compilation is complete
</I>&gt;<i> then the box is ready to reboot.
</I>&gt;<i> After booting from fixed disk,
</I>&gt;<i> naturally, set a root password,
</I>&gt;<i> give the box a name,
</I>&gt;<i> set the system and hardware clock date/time,
</I>&gt;<i> and finally configure the network by reading files
</I>&gt;<i> in /etc/networks.d/ and copying and modifying a template
</I>&gt;<i> that describes the network type.
</I>&gt;<i> Or if you are feeling lazy and have a DHCP server
</I>&gt;<i> then type something like
</I>&gt;<i> dhcpcd eth0
</I>&gt;<i> to obtain an instant IP address for the eth0 device.
</I>&gt;<i> Network configuration is the most manual aspect of
</I>&gt;<i> installing a Sorcerer box.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that is all done the Sorcerer box is ready
</I>&gt;<i> for updating and deploying with the software
</I>&gt;<i> required for mission critical operation.
</I>&gt;<i> I recommend that this be done in 2 steps.
</I>&gt;<i> First, update the box.
</I>&gt;<i> # augur easy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Software changes so quickly that half the software
</I>&gt;<i> on installed by an I/R is already obsolete by the time
</I>&gt;<i> that you receive it.
</I>&gt;<i> So having about 100 spells recast is not atypical.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that is done the exact mission critical spells to
</I>&gt;<i> install on the box can be selected using sorcery or
</I>&gt;<i> instead issued as command line parameters to cast.
</I>&gt;<i> Figuring out what to installs, if doing it by command line,
</I>&gt;<i> is best done with some assistance from augur.
</I>&gt;<i> The augur utility has some useful commands for searching
</I>&gt;<i> the catalog of available software by keyword, category, attribute.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer's catalog of software, also called a grimoire,
</I>&gt;<i> has about 3000+ entries in it.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that does not seem like much compared to a
</I>&gt;<i> pre-compiled binary based distro,
</I>&gt;<i> but that is because Sorcerer does not chop sources
</I>&gt;<i> into -dev packages, -lib packages, -exe packages,
</I>&gt;<i> nor does it chop something like coreutils into a bazillaion
</I>&gt;<i> smaller package for each of the utilities installed.
</I>&gt;<i> With Sorcerer, entire sources are compiled and installed.
</I>&gt;<i> Each Sorcerer box can be used for software development.
</I>&gt;<i> So what would seem like 12000 or more packages in
</I>&gt;<i> a pre-compiled binary based distro only amounts to about
</I>&gt;<i> 3000 spells in Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> In my opinion having fewer spells is less of a brain strain
</I>&gt;<i> on SAs for selecting software to install,
</I>&gt;<i> yet at the same time receiving much of the same high
</I>&gt;<i> quality software provided by other distros.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Installing something like kde-v4 is very simple.
</I>&gt;<i> cast kde-v4
</I>&gt;<i> gnome is equally simple.
</I>&gt;<i> cast gnome
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After the optional and switch menus are visited during cast
</I>&gt;<i> the rest of the process involving the downloading,
</I>&gt;<i> compilation, and installation of software is automatic
</I>&gt;<i> and happens in the background at nice 15.
</I>&gt;<i> There is no need to wait upon it.
</I>&gt;<i> Also additional software can be selected for casting
</I>&gt;<i> and added to the cast queue.
</I>&gt;<i> sorcery will install the software in the proper order,
</I>&gt;<i> and often use multiple CPU cores to compile software
</I>&gt;<i> concurrently for faster installation.
</I>&gt;<i> This behavior can be set using the CAST_RATE variable
</I>&gt;<i> which can be set somewhere under one of sorcery's
</I>&gt;<i> configuration menu when the sorcery tool is invoked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Installing kde-v4 or kde-v3 requires a long time to completion.
</I>&gt;<i> However, most other software,
</I>&gt;<i> excluding linux-modular and firefox,
</I>&gt;<i> installs very fast on box.
</I>&gt;<i> The process of waiting for software to install might require
</I>&gt;<i> between 30 minutes or several hours depending upon the
</I>&gt;<i> load that the SA requested.
</I>&gt;<i> This is referred to as the &quot;big wait&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> During this time logging out is fine,
</I>&gt;<i> just leave the computer on and connected to a network
</I>&gt;<i> so that it can complete installation of software.
</I>&gt;<i> Since this time is entirely non-interactive
</I>&gt;<i> it requires no SA attention.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;big wait&quot; both that happens during the final deployment
</I>&gt;<i> of sorcerer and when updating sorcerer boxes
</I>&gt;<i> is the one significant drawback
</I>&gt;<i> that is common to source based distros.
</I>&gt;<i> Having software compiled for optimal performance
</I>&gt;<i> actually requires some time to compile it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, the &quot;big wait&quot; is not a big factor in the long run.
</I>&gt;<i> During updates a box does not have to be reduced to runlevel 1.
</I>&gt;<i> Boxes can be updated while users are logged in
</I>&gt;<i> and while services are being provided.
</I>&gt;<i> Services will restart as necessary to start running the
</I>&gt;<i> newer software once the newer software is installed.
</I>&gt;<i> And because updating happens in the background at nice 15
</I>&gt;<i> a box is still available for hard work, or watching videos,
</I>&gt;<i> or even playing video games while it is updating.
</I>&gt;<i> The high nice value tells the kernel to provide cast with
</I>&gt;<i> CPU cycles that would otherwise be idle or wasted.
</I>&gt;<i> So if nothing heavy is running on the box,
</I>&gt;<i> besides the casting of spells,
</I>&gt;<i> then updates will happen quickly.
</I>&gt;<i> If updating while watching video
</I>&gt;<i> then the update will require a bit longer to complete
</I>&gt;<i> than if nearly all CPU cycles could be granted to cast.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please keep in mind that sometime during an update of
</I>&gt;<i> gnome or kde-v3 or kde-v4 that the GUI login manager
</I>&gt;<i> will be restarted which will probably abruptly end the X
</I>&gt;<i> session of any user that is logged in during that time.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry about that.
</I>&gt;<i> Hiding the pid for kdm or gdm which is normally in
</I>&gt;<i> /var/run/ within a subdirectory called hide
</I>&gt;<i> will normally keep those from restarting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other ways to avoid inconveniencing users is to schedule
</I>&gt;<i> updates by cronjobs that happen during night hours.
</I>&gt;<i> At many workplaces workstations are left on during night
</I>&gt;<i> and idle the CPU for nearly 14 hours.
</I>&gt;<i> Those are awesome times for updating.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now for the final recommendation.
</I>&gt;<i> Each Sorcerer box is unique because it can have a load out
</I>&gt;<i> of software on it that might not exist anywhere else.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, very rarely a problem will occur on a box
</I>&gt;<i> that has a very specific load out of software.
</I>&gt;<i> And that problem might not occur on my test box during testing.
</I>&gt;<i> So I could be unaware of it.
</I>&gt;<i> There was a problem like that a long time ago where
</I>&gt;<i> maybe db failed to compile if emacs was installed.
</I>&gt;<i> Or it was something like that where something failed to compile
</I>&gt;<i> because something else was installed.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, better to stay ahead of breakage
</I>&gt;<i> than to have it bust down upon your head.
</I>&gt;<i> The way to stay ahead of breaks is to have a box
</I>&gt;<i> deployed that is merely for testing, called the &quot;dev&quot; box.
</I>&gt;<i> Update the dev box before updating any production boxes.
</I>&gt;<i> That way if a problem could happen on the production boxes
</I>&gt;<i> then it will first happen on the dev box.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If both the dev box and production boxes are on automatic updates
</I>&gt;<i> then the dev box can be given a LAG=3D0 while the production boxes
</I>&gt;<i> are given LAG=3D7 in order to create a week's worth of separation.
</I>&gt;<i> This way problems will occur on the dev box a week ahead
</I>&gt;<i> of when they would occur on the production box.
</I>&gt;<i> That gives a SA time to spot a problem and interdict before
</I>&gt;<i> it becomes a problem on a production box.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, using high LAG values on production boxes means
</I>&gt;<i> that software updates for both bug fixes and security problems
</I>&gt;<i> will occur that much slower than when they become available
</I>&gt;<i> in the LAG=3D0 grimoire.
</I>&gt;<i> Alas, there is no perfect solution for this.
</I>&gt;<i> By default Sorcerer boxes have LAG=3D1
</I>&gt;<i> which is useful if the SA was able to set the
</I>&gt;<i> date/time for the box, but was unable to do so
</I>&gt;<i> so that the box knows what the correct UTC date/time is.
</I>&gt;<i> That could happen for example if the box is dual booted
</I>&gt;<i> with a windoze operating system that stores date internally
</I>&gt;<i> in localtime instead of UTC time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably, after having one or two
</I>&gt;<i> successful installations of Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> then using the menu driven installer
</I>&gt;<i> will seem less of an ordeal.
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment the menu driven installer
</I>&gt;<i> merely simplifies the steps of installation
</I>&gt;<i> by invoking required commands with proper parameters.
</I>&gt;<i> This is helpful since a SA would not actually have to know
</I>&gt;<i> the name of the utility for creating a filesystem or the
</I>&gt;<i> parameters to pass to it.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the steps involved in installation are not strictly
</I>&gt;<i> enforced by the menu driven installer.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, the SA must be aware of the general path
</I>&gt;<i> that one must travel in order to install a POSIX.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After mastering the menu driven installer
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps try attempting a manual install that does not
</I>&gt;<i> involve using the menu driven installer.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it is possible.
</I>&gt;<i> And doing so will gain confidence in one's knowledge
</I>&gt;<i> of how the pieces of a POSIX fit together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Compared to what used to by required in order to manually
</I>&gt;<i> install Debian more than a decade ago, Sorcerer is a bit
</I>&gt;<i> more difficult to manually install.
</I>&gt;<i> But it involves creating a partition, a filesystem, copying files,
</I>&gt;<i> unarchiving tarballs, editing lilo.conf.head
</I>&gt;<i> and then running many of the scripts in
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/ in order to handle the tedious things like
</I>&gt;<i> generating the sysvinit /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/* symbolic links,
</I>&gt;<i> creating the initramfs, installing lilo, etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer is actually even a bit gentle to the SA that
</I>&gt;<i> tries to do a manual install assuming the attempt is
</I>&gt;<i> nearly perfect.
</I>&gt;<i> For example if a root partition is not specified in /etc/fstab
</I>&gt;<i> then there is a menu that appears during sysinit that allows
</I>&gt;<i> the SA to specify which partition to mount as the root partition.
</I>&gt;<i> But even so, eventually /etc/fstab should be properly edited
</I>&gt;<i> to include a root partition.
</I>&gt;<i> But not having it that way will not block a box from booting
</I>&gt;<i> if the SA is willing to assist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another method might be to try to do the manual install,
</I>&gt;<i> then fail to be able to boot the box,
</I>&gt;<i> so then boot using the I/R
</I>&gt;<i> and select the fixed disk partition for the root filesystem.
</I>&gt;<i> Now it is loaded, but not yet complete.
</I>&gt;<i> Check /etc/lilo.conf.head and /etc/fstab and make corrections.
</I>&gt;<i> Now run /etc/init.d/rc.d.
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, shutdown -r
</I>&gt;<i> At this point the shutdown scripts will run that will do the
</I>&gt;<i> necessary things like creating an initramfs and installing lilo and such.
</I>&gt;<i> And if it is sufficient then the box will be bootable from fixed disk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The menu driven installer is a big help to SAs
</I>&gt;<i> for being able to install a box quickly for very little SA attention.
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, just by pressing arrow keys, space and enter
</I>&gt;<i> and pressing / at one point
</I>&gt;<i> is all that is required to go through the menu driven installer
</I>&gt;<i> after invoking it with sinstall.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, however you want to install Sorcerer is
</I>&gt;<i> properly the correct method as long as it is bootable
</I>&gt;<i> after installation.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> After creating one Sorcerer box you might want to
</I>&gt;<i> create a chrooted install to use as a template for new boxes.
</I>&gt;<i> That way new boxes can be installed by booting from an I/R,
</I>&gt;<i> creating a filesytem, starting the network,
</I>&gt;<i> scping a compressed tarball,
</I>&gt;<i> and then uncompressing it.
</I>&gt;<i> Other SAs might temporarily install a disk in a removable drive bay
</I>&gt;<i> and then hot plug it into a Sorcerer box and then do the installation
</I>&gt;<i> to the removable from the already deployed box.
</I>&gt;<i> By this method installing without an CD drive is possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rumor has it that a USB memory drive can be ruined by
</I>&gt;<i> dding a bootable CD image, such as Sorcerer's I/R,
</I>&gt;<i> to the USB memory drive's device.
</I>&gt;<i> According to rumor the USB memory drive then acts as
</I>&gt;<i> if it is a bootable detachable CD device.
</I>&gt;<i> But once written that way the change can not be undone.
</I>&gt;<i> But $10 or less for a USB thumb drive is cheaper
</I>&gt;<i> than buying an optical disk drive and also tends to
</I>&gt;<i> be faster than installing from CD.
</I>&gt;<i> Also most computers created during 2004 or later
</I>&gt;<i> are capable of booting from a USB device.
</I>&gt;<i> Groovy.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My advice is to keep trying with the installation.
</I>&gt;<i> One a person's understanding of the steps required
</I>&gt;<i> for installation is complete
</I>&gt;<i> then there is practically no way to mess it up.
</I>&gt;<i> Failure to achieve an installed Sorcerer box
</I>&gt;<i> while using the menu driven installer is usually
</I>&gt;<i> due to a SA skipping an important step.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, be careful.
</I>&gt;<i> If a menu is marked as optional,
</I>&gt;<i> but you might be uncertain about what it does
</I>&gt;<i> then visit that menu and see what it says.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, initializing a filesystem is optional if an
</I>&gt;<i> initialized filesystem already exists.
</I>&gt;<i> But if it does not already exist
</I>&gt;<i> then that menu is not optional.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe that is strange logic for the use
</I>&gt;<i> of the word optional.
</I>&gt;<i> But the word optional does mean that in some cases
</I>&gt;<i> where the SA has already done that step previously
</I>&gt;<i> then installation is possible without visiting an optional menu.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, when installing Sorcerer on a disk while overwriting
</I>&gt;<i> some other operating system then the disk is already partitioned
</I>&gt;<i> and therefore visiting the partitioning menu is optional.
</I>&gt;<i> However, in order to re-use a partition
</I>&gt;<i> then the filesystem initialization menu should be visited
</I>&gt;<i> in order to create a new empty filesystem on an existing partition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After some consideration I am guessing that the use of
</I>&gt;<i> the word &quot;optional&quot; is confusing in the context of the menu
</I>&gt;<i> driven installer, because the SA must know why a menu
</I>&gt;<i> is optional in order to determine if the menu should be visited.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I must consider this in detail to determine how to help SAs
</I>&gt;<i> make better choices about skipping optional menus.
</I>&gt;<i> I can not simply force SAs to initialize every partition that
</I>&gt;<i> is specified in in the fstab menu,
</I>&gt;<i> because that could lead to unwanted data loss.
</I>&gt;<i> So, maybe I can give SAs some second chance
</I>&gt;<i> at skipped optional menus without forcing them
</I>&gt;<i> to do them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, the in this respect the menu driven installer
</I>&gt;<i> is not buggy, but for SAs very new to Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> the use of the word &quot;optional&quot; is confusing
</I>&gt;<i> and perhaps misleading?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Creating a menu driven installer that is lose enough
</I>&gt;<i> for senior level SAs to make it do what they want,
</I>&gt;<i> yet tight enough to keep new SAs from falling through
</I>&gt;<i> the cracks is difficult.
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimately, the menu driven installer should be an experience
</I>&gt;<i> that is survivable without the use of external documentation
</I>&gt;<i> in order to properly navigate the menus.
</I>&gt;<i> The use of Sorcerer should be a positive successful
</I>&gt;<i> hands-on experience where there is no reading 300 pages
</I>&gt;<i> of documentation before unwrapping the CD.
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, the menu driven installer is not there yet.
</I>&gt;<i> But you will probably enjoy augur's help,
</I>&gt;<i> both the help menu and
</I>&gt;<i> the verbose help available on each augur parameter.
</I>&gt;<i>
