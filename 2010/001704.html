Correct, because output is not interactive,
but instead re-directed into a log file.
In some runlevels the process run backgrounded.
That is definitely non-interactive.
And while the controlling script might stay attached
to the console for runlevels the virtual console gettys
are always started prior to starting the runlevel.
That way a hang during runlevel execution can
not cause a situation where the no one can log into the box.

To implement a step by step interactive boot
requires that all of the above be sacrificed.
No more /etc/init.d/log.d/{sysinit,runlevel.$RUNLEVEL}
No more parallel execution of init-scripts during boot.
No more starting login gettys before completing runlevel.
It must all stay attached and sequential.
That is a lot to give up!

Also if a problem becomes evident because something ran
such as dmsetup
then is there is no error report, because it ran just fine,
and the problem already exists by the time that
a problem due to it is encountered.
Instead of a &quot;stop on error&quot;
are you not wishing more for a &quot;stop before error?&quot;
Not so easy to do?

You want to prompt before each init-script is run?
# ls /etc/init.d | wc -l
154

That is approximately a meager 150 pauses
for SA input during boot.

&gt;<i> 2) if you deactivate partially some start service (for exemple the
</I>&gt;<i> first dm service) other service depending on it might be run,
</I>&gt;<i> there is no real check if a required service
</I>&gt;<i> has or not effectively started or not.
</I>
There is a check.
It is done by the use of lock files.
I ommitted implementing those checks on purpose,
because it merely makes init-scripts slower.
And I would also have to mount a tmpfs on /var/lock.

In the situation you describe I could also have the
init-script dmsetup check that the dm-mod module is loaded.
But that is pointless since it would be loaded unless
the SA disabled that init-script.

At one time all of the dm stuff would be in one hard
to understand slow to execute init-script.
However, by breaking it up into separate init-scripts
then I gain the full benefit of using role specific init-script
design where the entire role of an init-script is to load a module
or is to mount a filesystem.
Then if something does not go according to plan
then a little red string prints instead of silently
not acknowledging the error as if it was a single modprobe
line in a much larger and more complicated init-script.

&gt;<i> in my case mdadm--assemble has not stated because
</I>&gt;<i> I've no config file... however all service that rely
</I>&gt;<i> upon this service are still launched!
</I>&gt;<i> in cryptsetup script I see : required-start : dmsetup
</I>
cryptsetup does require a device mapper,
but does not require the use of LVM2.
In many cases the requirement you see
does not specify that the afore mentioned
service is required.
Instead it merely ensure that the afore mentioned
service starts before this service.

&gt;<i> BUT if I remove dmsetup from the /etc/rc.d/rcS directory.
</I>&gt;<i> ... then do exec /init, then login as root on password prompt,
</I>&gt;<i> cat /etc/init.d/log.d/sysinit | grep crypt,
</I>&gt;<i> I see that the service has started!
</I>&gt;<i> a required service has never started but the script
</I>&gt;<i> is still launched! OUCH!
</I>
That is a complaint that should be filed with the people
who created the design for LSB init-scripts, because
there is no separate way to specify the difference between
a service that is required and a service that should be
started prior.

dmsetup should be started before LUKS encryption.
However, dmsetup is not required to implement LUKS encryption.
Only the device-mapper module must be loaded.
And sometimes modules such as dm-mod
would be load automatically when required
by a program that needs them.

&gt;<i> 2) there shall be an entry stepbystep_init in
</I>&gt;<i> lilo menu that prompt the root for password
</I>&gt;<i> at beginning of /init and ask him at each start
</I>&gt;<i> of a service if he wants to start it and stop if error
</I>
While not impossible to accomplish
it can not simply be laid ontop of what already exists.
The implementation would likely require the specification
of a runlevel as kernel parameter.
For example, nothing is defined as runlevel 7.
So the necessary code could be added as runlevel 7.
Why the new runlevel?

1: init-scripts must be run wrapped.
2: they must be run sequentially.
3: they must be run attached
4: if it is even possible then
   the start of virtual console login gettys
   must be postponed until the runlevel finishes execution.
5: this probably requires a new or modified installation
   of /etc/inittab to accomplish 4:

And what to do in the case of an error?
Allow the person at console to temporarily open
a shell and then

&gt;<i> 4)/etc/init.d/log.d/* files shall be stripped of any color escaping
</I>&gt;<i> characters that are sure beautiful at console
</I>&gt;<i> but pain in the less....
</I>
try:
cat /etc/init.d/log.d/runlevel.* | sed 's:.\[[0-9][0-9]m::g'
The sed statement will probably only remove color codes.

&gt;<i> this is just an idea, but instead of
</I>&gt;<i> creating symlinks into /etc/rc.d/*/
</I>&gt;<i> why not create a whole bash script which will have lines like
</I>
If you want to create a BSD style init
where one absurdly complicated script controls everything
then go ahead and try.

But it would be a huge step backwards on Sorcerer .
Tthe modular System-V style init enables components
to be easily added or removed.
For example:
cryptsetup can be removed.
LVM2 used to be removable, but is currently held down by lilo.
However, the init-scripts installed by LVM2
can still be disabled.

The beauty of the symbolic link sysvinit style with runlevel directories
is that the scripts are pre-ordered to execute in proper order.
It is not as if the the scripts execute in random order.

&gt;<i> -----------------snap
</I>&gt;<i> start_service /etc/init.d/dm-mod
</I>&gt;<i> started_service dm-mod &amp;&amp; cryptsetup
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------end snap
</I>
I could have every init-script that requires dm-mod module
to be loaded to execute a mod-probe
or check for a lock file in /var/lock
However, it is not something of such great importance
that it requires the additional time every boot
to redundantly and repeatedly check.
Probably the only way dm-mod module does not load
is if the SA disabled the init-script.

# chmod 600 /etc/init.d/dm-mod

I can create lock files in /var/lock/
to track the successful execution of every init-script
I never implemented the code because it seemed to be
a waste that slows down booting.
Besides the outcome of many init-scripts can either
be checked with a grep or a process ID.
Not states that I must do locking to indicate
what services have successfully started and/or
which have failed.
Consequently, I do not do it.
For the most part it only requires some modifications
to /lib/lsb/init-functions rather than having to
modify every init-script in /etc/init.d/
However, checking for lock files does require
specific init-script modification.
The LSB specifications do not specify the difference
between an init-script that is listed merely for
ordering purposes as compared with an init-script
that is listed because it must successfully complete
prior to starting the current init-script.

I understand what you are communicating.
You do not want to be run-over and run-down
by a non-stop-able init train of events.
The alternative is purty much a 100 to 200
stopping stations inserted on the line.
Then the SA must fully conduct and steer
the init-process approving each stop
before it happens.
Booting a box would become a serious chore
in that fashion.

Assuming that it is set to stop on error instead
of pause before each init-script executes
then an error must be correctable to be of any use.
And if the SA is expecting an error to happen
then the SA must carefully step through each init-script
to intercept and pre-empt the error.
If not handled on a script-by-script basis
then a menu must be displayed before booting
that allows the SA to select stop points and
to selectively disable init-scripts.
And it would have to be done twice,
once for sysinit and once for runlevel.

&gt;<i>From my perspective:
</I>Problems that occur during runlevel
are not worth correcting until runlevel completes.
Usually such problems are not catastrophic.
The worst problems reported thus far is that
the X server starts without keyboard/pointer input.
And that could be avoided by putting 3
on the kernel command line to boot runlevel 3,
fix the problem then reboot into default runlevel 4 or 5.

Problems that occur during sysinit are rare
and can be the most problematic since
such problems might prevent mounting of
the real root filesytem.
In that situation I want full control.
And full control over what happens means
that I must start using rdinit=/bin/bash
That way I gain a prompt and can control
what executes.
I can set the PATH and then begin executing
init-scripts in /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/ up until the point
where I expect a problem.

SAs aught not be afraid of doing some trouble-shooting
using a command prompt instead of a menu.
A menu is both a convenience and a crutch,
because it exposes and makes easy certain pre-determined
paths while obscuring alternatives that might be better to use.

If SAs agree
then I can implement locking that shows from inspecting
of /var/lock/{fail,work}/ the outcome of init-scripts.
Since it will likely be implemented by wrapping init-scripts
to check the return value
then it will cost approximately twice the usually PID allocation
and /bin/dash execution of the current method of booting.

Anything that interactively modifies the execution of runlevel
requires a new /etc/inittab and new runlevel 7 to implement.
Does not seem a good choice
since a SA should be able to correct errors that happen
during runlevel after runlevel execution completes.

sysinit always runs in series.
The init-scripts run during sysinit tend to be tiny and fast.
Since virtual consoles are not started until after sysinit ends
then sysinit can be made more or less interactive.
I prefer to debug it with initrd=/bin/bash
However, if desired I can create
/init.debug
/init.debug would be like init except it would contain
extra menus for selection of such things as:
which init-scripts to execute;
option menu before execution;
shell on failures, etc...

There are about 40 to 50 init-scripts that execute during sysinit.
Although I do not know exactly how interactive debugging
of sysinit should happen by menus I can at least try to
hack an initial implementation.
Naturally, after trying it,
improvements would be made due to SA feedback.
And it could be selected during boot by adding:
rdinit=/init.debug

LSB comment controlled style System 5 init
has some short-comings.
Yet overall it seems more flexible than a BSD style init.
I rather not create a system for controlling init
that relies upon a single file.

For example, merely having /etc/inittab is troublesome.
A single file controls too much of what happens during init.
I can not replace /etc/inittab distribution wide
because some SAs have modified
more than merely the default runlevel.
The number of gettys and the getty programs
might also be modified.
Replacing /etc/inittab yet preserving the default
runlevel might still inconvenience some SAs.

Therefore, changes that involve modifying
/etc/inittab seem nearly too high a cost
compared to providing a convenience that
many SAs might never use.

Lastly the overhead for using lockfiles and checks
still outweighs the benefits and therefore will
not be implemented without a compelling arugment
that illuminates all the banes and boons and shows
how the boons significant outweigh the banes.

In summary I will create an alternate:
/init.debug
It can be selected during boot by using a kernel parameter:
rdinit=/init.debug
It will only provide interaction while sysinit is running
and when runlevel is reached the box will continue
booting normally as if /init had run instead.

That seems like an adequate compromise.
However, the initial implementation
might be less than desirable.
And the final implementation
might accomplish less than expected.
However, given your example situation
where the omission of running certain
init-scripts provided a booting solution
this goal I can work towards making easier to accomplish.

Is the execution of:
/sbin/dmsetup mknodes
causing the unwanted locking?
What is causing the unwanted locking?
Congrats on finding a way around the problem.
But more precisely what is the problem
and why is it happening, please?

If we know more about the problem then
we might be able to script around it in some cases,
or undo the problem,
or alert the SA what could be causing the problem.

When
/sbin/dmsetup mkdnods
executes
what does it create in /dev/mapper/
other than:
crw------- 1 root root 10, 60 Jun 17 07:35 /dev/mapper/control

Is there something in there such as a:
luks-hda2
Anything to suggest that a partition is
being detected as part of something
that it is no longer part of?

I am still curious as to the cause of the problem.
The problem is probably not distribution wide,
but there might be something that can be changed
in order to help prevent the problem.
Do partitions have the wrong ID number?
Were they previously part of a md-raid, LVM2,
or LUKS encrypted partition?

I want to expect that if something about
the setup of the device mapper is causing problems
then those problems are due to something
odd about the partitions.
But so far that is merely an assumption
that I expect has a less than 50% probability of being so.
And an assumption like that provides me with
no possibility of implementing a detection nor work-around.
If time permits
then please investigate the problem further.
