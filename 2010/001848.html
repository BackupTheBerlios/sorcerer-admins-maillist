Hash: RIPEMD160

I'm not really all that concerned with the speed of boots. My boxes
generally aren't rebooted for several months, sometimes years if their
in production at client sites.

10 seconds here  or there, or even a minute means absolutely nothing to
me (although I can truly appreciate being able to show how quickly a
Sorcerer box boots :) ).

By the same token, the stability of a running machine is everything and
I really couldn't honestly say how long a machine takes to boot anyway,
save for a couple of laptops, since once I power a machine up I'm
typically off doing something else while this occurs, and 'ps' and
'netstat' my important stuff later, and 'tail -f'or 'grep' my logs.

OTOH, dmesg simply isn't enough for me sometimes if there are errors.
Errors which print to the console but aren't included in any logfiles
(used to be a good argument for watching the boot sequence back in the
386 days, when you could actually read it - nowadays, it simply scrolls
by too fast to matter anyway, leaving only that last hundred lines or so
available for inspection.

Having that stuff somehow retained in a 'bootlog' that shows the
&quot;**console messages**&quot; as they actually appear in the console during the
real boot sequence could be a real life saver :)

Just my thoughts.

</I>&gt;<i> and I want to learn the consensus about a potential change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A new proposal is for init-scripts to run slower
</I>&gt;<i> by having those init-scripts that exit with success
</I>&gt;<i> create lock files in /var/lock/ that indicate both the
</I>&gt;<i> name of the init-script that ran and any service name it provides.
</I>&gt;<i> Doing so comes at a cost of overhead,
</I>&gt;<i> and slower runlevel execution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Creating lock files in /var/lock/ is not pointless.
</I>&gt;<i> The intended use of such lock files is to prevent init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> that run later from running if the init-scripts or service that
</I>&gt;<i> they require did not successfully start before it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # grep Required-Start: /etc/init.d/udevd
</I>&gt;<i> # Required-Start: dev-cp sys
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # grep Required-Start: /etc/init.d/udevtrigger
</I>&gt;<i> # Required-Start: udevd
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the dev-cp init-script returns failed or is missing
</I>&gt;<i> then the udevd init-script would never be started
</I>&gt;<i> and if udevd never starts then udevtrigger never starts
</I>&gt;<i> and coldplug events are never replayed.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, no modules are loaded and
</I>&gt;<i> no device nodes are created.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It works something like that.
</I>&gt;<i> One failure during boot could create a rather
</I>&gt;<i> large cascade of auto-failured  init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The current method of executing init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> does not require lock files and normally will
</I>&gt;<i> not create a lock file unless the init-script
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly creates a lock file.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually if an init-script creates a lock file,
</I>&gt;<i> such as /etc/init.d/networks
</I>&gt;<i> then it is that init-script that will also
</I>&gt;<i> check for the existence of a lock file.
</I>&gt;<i> Lock files have limited use and no purpose
</I>&gt;<i> other than what an init-script would define for it's own lock file.
</I>&gt;<i> Naturally, this method has only the overhead that it already has.
</I>&gt;<i> It is neither slower nor faster since it is the default method.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So to recapitulate
</I>&gt;<i> The current method logs errors in red, ignores errors,
</I>&gt;<i> and continues booting as best as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> I floss my teeth and am not afraid of a little bit of red every now and then.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The proposed new method turns a tiny little red mark
</I>&gt;<i> into a huge bloody wound by thrusting in a knife and giving
</I>&gt;<i> it a hard twist.
</I>&gt;<i> Or less metaphorically a tiny error that happens early
</I>&gt;<i> can turn into a mountain of init-scripts that will not be executed,
</I>&gt;<i> just because a prior init-script failed or was missing.
</I>&gt;<i> And the new method is slower and runs more processes as overhead.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So do we go with the devil we know?
</I>&gt;<i> Or do we risk new bugs
</I>&gt;<i> by fixing what is not broken?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Make no assumptions about who wants what.
</I>&gt;<i> This is not about politics or siding with one person or another.
</I>&gt;<i> This discussion is about how each SAs wants their box to run.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the question is,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Do we stay with the current rapid fire and forget init-script launch method,
</I>&gt;<i> or do we add in CPU cycle munching control methods
</I>&gt;<i> that could lead to greater control over the execution of init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> that would probably be used to autofail init-scripts that require
</I>&gt;<i> an init-script that did not run or return with an error?&quot;
