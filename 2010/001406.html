<PRE>I have been considering feedback from SAs
who have attempted to install Sorcerer,
yet did not quite accomplish the task.
Frequently, there is the report
that goes something like,
&quot;It ran out of memory and killed the menu driven installer.&quot;

My best guess about this is that SAs are either not
specifying a &quot;/&quot; root filesystem in the fstab menu,
or not mounting it, or not initializing it before mounting.
If a root filesystem on a physical storage device such as a
fixed disk or USB memory stick is not mounted on
/media/root/
then the install script will attempt to do the installation
to the initramfs/rootfs filesystem which is memory.
This is not desirable.

Now I wrote above that a real filesystem must be mounted
on /media/root
However, the SA does not have to do this manually.
The menu driven installer will be able to do this.
And in most cases the menu driven installer should do this,
rather than the SA.

For a filesystem to be created on a device
the device must first have partitions.
If the fixed disk is not partitioned
then select partitioning from the menu,
I prefer fdisk, and carve out at least one partition.

Even a partition exists on a disk
that partition is not suitable for mounting unless
a filesystem exists on that partition.

In the sorcery's fstab creation menu
that partition should be offered as an entry.
Select it.
Specify that it should be mounted as /
because every box must have a / filesystem.
That is the root filesystem.
Now specify a filesystem for /
In the past I tended to use ext3.
But for testing I use ext4.
Either ext3 or ext4 are good choices.
Once those are entered for that partition
then that is enough information for the menu
driven installer to handle that partition.

I do not recommend installing Sorcerer onto a
filesystem that already has something else installed.
In some cases a SA could manually do this by avoiding
the filesystem initialization menu.
A SA would want to do this if the SA wants to manually
remove everything from that partition except /home/
and has already done so before using the sorcery
menu driven installer.

In the past distributions recommended /home/ be kept
on a separate partition to avoid having to wipe it
while doing a complete re-install of the operating system
that was required every year or two.
However, that has never been a requirement with Sorcerer.
Sorcerer can be installed once and updated forever
as long as those updates are no further than 3 months apart.
Longer jumps run greater risks of encountering
an unexpected problem that the SA would have to manually solve.
However, I digressed.
Sorry.

Please visit the filesystem initialization menu
and select that new partition for initialization.
If a partition does not have a filessystem
then the partition can no be mounted.
So this is an important step.
