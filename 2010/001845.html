<PRE>Probably udev is already running.
Trying to start an already running service looks like:

# /etc/init.d/udevd start
 * udevd starting                                               [ warning ]
 * udevd not started                                            [ failed  ]
 * udevd is running                                             [ warning ]

Alternatively you could execute:

# /etc/init.d/udevd restart

or

# /etc/init.d/udevd-restart start

Or the running udevd processes can be killed off
and start directly from command line.

The udevd daemon waits for events.
coldplug events can be triggered by running
/etc/init.d/udevtrigger
hotplug events trigger automatically
as devices are plugged and/or unplugged.
Both PCMCIA and USB device removal/addition
are both handled as hotplug events.

/etc/init.d/udevsettle is run after
/etc/init.d/udevtrigger
when booting from initramfs.
There are a couple of reasons
for waiting for the completion of
the handling of coldplug events.
First, device nodes for disk are not
immediately available until after udevd
handles those events.
udevd will load modules, load firmware,
and create device nodes in /dev/
and other symbolic links as necessary.
Checking/mounting filesystems can
not be accomplished until after udevd
has finished it's task.

Likewise, other devices, such as networking
devices would also be unavailable until
udevd completes the handling of re-triggered cold plug events.
If networking should start during sysinit,
such as to provide a / or /usr on NFS,
then udev must complete the handling
of coldplug networking events.

Also udev handles these events in parallel
and does a momentary huge loadavg.
The SA would not notice this because
it happens on rootfs all in RAM.
Consequently, hardware detection
and preparations to use the hardware
happen extremely fast while booting.

udevd, the coldplug event re-trigger,
are important parts of booting because
without it the linux kernel only creates
device nodes on devtmpfs for devices
that are compiled directly into the kernel
and can be detected.
The kernel seems to no longer load
firmware and modules itself.
udev is an important bridge to cross
during sysinit before a box is able to
mount the real root filesystem and
transition to it and begin running the runlevel.

Sorcerer boxes should be bootable
even if udevd breaks.
Previously saved list of modules and
a previously saved /dev are reused when booting
using the fast initramfs image.
Normally, those are not used, but
can be explicitly requested by adding
the kernel parameter: coldplug

Having modprobe load the modules in proper order
and use an old /dev should be able to set the box
up the same way udev did on a slightly older boot.
When modules are loaded by modprobe
then modprobe also loads the appropriate firmware.
By copying a previous outcome for udev
a box should enter into a state where it can
check filesystems and mount the real root filesystem.

However, if a box has any hardware changes,
such as disks adding/removing/partitioning
then the fast boot image should not be used.
Use the full image for booting when a box has changes.
The fast image is a fast method for booting when
a box has undergone no hardware changes.

udev is neat.
But new releases have a history of being problematic.
More often than not I find and do not allow for those
terminally ill versions of udev to reach Sorcerer boxes.
However, I implemented a udev safety net for SAs
to easily circumvent a problematic udev.
I want Sorcerer boxes to be reasonably robust.
Since I know udev can be broke
I want to anticipate for that possibility
and be able to handle it without using an I/R CD.

In the past I kept an old udev stored in /etc/udev.old/
that I could copy out to / in that event.
Not the most eloquent solution
and I only had that available on my test box.
Being able to save and replay previously handled
udev coldplug events is an eloquent solution.
