</I>

Good now that is a useful error message.
Failing to mount / will have files copied to
/media/root on the initramfs.
The initramfs will probably fill up all available RAM
And then the kernel will probably kill off some process.

That step of having a real filesystem mounted on
/media/root is very important.

In the fstab menu a / filesystem must be declared
And that filesystem must be either already be initialized
or must be initialized before it is mounted.
Filesystem initialization is also called soft formatting.
Until this is done that area of disk might have random data.
Without a proper proper filesystem there it can not be mounted.

So first declare / in the fstab menu and give it a filesystem type
such as ext3.
Then, at the initialization menu make sure that there is a [*]
in the box where the / filesystem is so that the / receives a
fresh new filesystem.
Unless one knows exactly what they are doing
Sorcerer should be installed into a clean new file system.
If both of those steps are complete
then mounting / should succeed.

However, it could fail.
If installing within a virtual machine emulator
and the file that holds the virtual drive is
not owned by the same user as is running the
virtual machine emulation program or that user
is not granted write permission
then partitioning the disk
and initializing the filesystem will fail.
However, I am assuming that you are installing
Sorcerer on real hardware and not virtual.
So this should not be a problem.

Now if somehow this still does not work...
There is another way!
Switch to a separate virtual console by pressing alt-F2
login.
manually run fsck on a drive,
manually create file systems,
manually mount a root filesystem at /media/root
and then begin the install program.

If doing that portion manually
please still declare a / filesystem in the fstab menu.
However, the skipping the initialization menu is a good choice
since the / filesystem is already mounted at /media/root
Now goto into the mount menu and it will fail,
because it is already mounted.
But that is not a problem.
Then visit the transfer menu and the files will begin
transferring to /media/root

By doing part of the install process manually
one can ensure that /media/root does contain the
filesystem that one wants for the root filesystem.
Doing it partially manually should not be necessary.
But it is possible to do it this way.

Remember that if there is a separate /boot partition
then one must first mount /media/root and then mount
the /boot partition as /media/root/boot
prior to starting sinstall.
The same would be true for other partitions/filesystems
that attach somewhere within /

I apologize that this is not a step by step guide.
I do not have the key presses for navigating the menu
driven installer memorized.
That would be like memorizing each footstep taken
between one's home and the grocery store.
Instead I am familiar with the path to take in order
to walk between the two destinations.
I know where to turn right, where to turn left,
and when to cross the street.
And it makes sense.

Perhaps the best experience that can be expected
when using the menu driven installer is to already be
familiar with what happens during the installation
of an operating system.
That way one can arrive at their desired destination
without having to count and remember each step.

So this is what the journey looks like:
Partition a disk,
using a program such as fdisk.
Mark one partition as bootable.
And give proper filesystem label/types
to the partitions created using fdisk.
Install bootable code to the master boot record,
using a program such as ms-sys

At this point a fixed disk has a bootable MBR,
a partition table, and a few partitions on it.
At this point the fixed disk is like a bedframe and bed.
Yet there are no sheets on it.

Now the filesystems must be created/initialized,
what is also called soft formatting.
This is like putting the clean sheets on the bed.

After the filesystems exist then the can be mounted.
And this is like turning down the covers so someone
can enter in between the clean sheets on the bed.

Now files from the Install/Rescue disk
can be transferred onto the mounted filesystem.
This is like tucking someone into bed.

Finally, lilo, the linux [boot] loader is installed
to the boot block of /boot or if /boot does not exist
then lilo installs to the boot block of /
This step is like adding the warm comforter ontop
of the bed so that the people between the sheets
will sleep comfortably warm all night long.

Of course this example is a bit of an over-simplification.
But it provides an easy to understand analogy of the
installation of an operating system where the necessary
actions are not unlike something simple like preparing a bed
for someone to sleep in.

More than 90% of the files installed on a box will
remain unused during their existence on disk.
And so are like a bed full of small children
that are constantly sleeping.  :)
If everything is done correctly so that / can be mounted
on /media/root then they can all be tucked into bed for
a nice long slumber party.

That said I want some additional information please.
Please log into virtual console 2 alt-f2 during install.
After the partitioning a disk check /dev
ls /dev
If the disk is IDE then there should be names like
/dev/hda1 /dev/hda2 and so forth
that indicate device nodes for the new partitions.
If it is SCSI then there would be names like
/dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 /dev/sda3

If for some reason these device nodes did not appear in /dev
then that would indicate a problem.
It might indicate that udevd is not running.
If udevd is running then the creation of those
new device nodes in /dev would be automatic.
It also might indicating that running fdisk failed.
It could fail because the fixed disk is somehow
write protected.
It might also fail because the SA exited fdisk
by pressing q &lt;enter&gt; instead of w &lt;enter&gt;

If the partition device nodes appear in /dev
Then they should also appear on the fdisk menu
as selectable entries.
If one goes into the fdisk menu and instead chooses device
and then enters in an arbitrary device such as
/dev/hdc4 and specifies a filesystem
then this will not work if /dev/hdc4 does not really exist
In the fdisk menu the partition or logic volumes selected
for filesystems must also exist in /dev

If the device nodes for partitions or logic devices
are not appearing in /dev
then that does not indicate a problem with the menu driven installer.
Instead it is a different problem such as a problem with udev
or a simple error such as qutting out of fdisk instead of
writing the new partition information.

The convenience of using the menu driven installer
comes at the cost of not showing the location of a problem
as clearly as would be observed while doing a manual install.
If doing a manual install one tries to create a filesystem on
/dev/hda1 and there is no hda1 block device node in /dev
then right away one understand that the reason that the
make filsystem program failed was because
/dev/hda1 does not exist.
That does not explain why /dev/hda1 does not exist,
but at least one knows that one must first find out why
/dev/hda1 does not exist and correct that problem
before progressing onward to creating the filesystem.

Whew, sorry if that is a lot to read and follow.
If the outcome of running the menu driven installer
is unsuccessful that might not be due to an error
or misunderstanding on the part of the SA.
Rather if something unexpected is happening such
as device nodes are not being created in /dev for partitions
then that would cause a failure to be able to install.

Probably by understanding what
to expect and what to look for
grants the best probability for being
able to observe where a problem
is happening and surmise the solution.
Because if something unexpected is happening
then even knowing the exact keys to press in order
to complete the menu driven installer
would still not achieve a successful outcome.

As I wrote before the menu driven installer
is very loose and not rigid.
Even if /media/root fails to mount
the menu driven installer will still assume
that everything is fine and allow
files to be transferred from the I/R to /media/root
The reason that it is loose like this is for the convenience
of SAs that want to mix some parts of a manual install
yet still be able to complete the installation using the
menu driven install program.

Yet if /media/root fails to mount
the menu driven installer offers no explanation
as to why this happened nor any alternatives about
what to do about it.

If I were using the menu driven installer and encounters
that error message that /media/root was not successfully mounted
then I would immediately switch to a separate virtual console,
log in, and investigate /dev
and cat /proc/mounts
And look even run the mount command manually
in order to see if that provides additional clues.

As I mentioned previously /media/root might fail to mount
merely because the SA intentionally mounted it prior
to starting sinstall.
The sinstall program does not guess what the SA intends to do.
So there is no definite always right always wrong solution
to do in the event where /media/root fails to mount.
However, that said normally /media/root will mount
if all the SA does is boot, run sinstall, and follow the menus.
If /media/root fails to mount and the SA did not do something
to cause this intentionally
then that hints at a problem
that something unexpected happened
and that the problem should be investigated.

Really, sinstall is a decent install program
and it aught to be able to get the job done.
Without investigating what is happening first hand
on the box that is having a problem
I have an almost impossible time trying to surmise
what the cause of the problem could be.

Anyway that said...
the reason that the menu driven installer is provided
is because listing all the steps possible during a manual
installation procedure is enormous, confusing, time consuming,
and has a huge risk of input error.
The menu driven installer is supposed to be like a taxi cab ride.
Hop inside the car, tell the driver the destination,
and the driver takes the passenger to every location
that the passenger specifies.
It aught to be a nice, fun, relaxing experience.

So I hope we find out what is happening on your box
that successful installation will become possible
without having to attempt a manual install.
