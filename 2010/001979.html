<PRE>&gt;<i> I definitely agree that it's desirable to keep the safety built in. I
</I>&gt;<i> have just taken the default options many times on many spells.
</I>&gt;<i> What I am proposing is that whenever I am bored or hit a spell that is
</I>&gt;<i> particularly difficult to figure out, I might clean it up and send it
</I>&gt;<i> in for approval by you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ie:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> $RANDOM_SPELL config:
</I>&gt;<i> [ ] without $GOOD_OPTION1
</I>&gt;<i> [ ] without $GOOD_OPTION2
</I>&gt;<i> [ ] with &#160; &#160; &#160;$BAD_OPTION1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and so on... This way the options that are safe are always empty,
</I>&gt;<i> unless the SA has explicitly turned something on or off.
</I>
Uhm, well yes, that was the idea I was going for.
The concept of a switch, at the very least,
must be the idea that it is optional and
does not have to be on.
If it must be enabled
then what is point in giving the SA
an opportunity to disable it?


&gt;<i> Troubleshooting why a spell does not work might also be easier like
</I>&gt;<i> this. What would be nice, though, is a way to see what the current
</I>&gt;<i> config for a spell is from augur. And I do still long for the days
</I>&gt;<i> where I could reconfigure a spell without issuing augur forget. It's
</I>&gt;<i> too big of a hammer for some of the surgical configs I want to do.
</I>
Yes it is one big hammer.
But it hits the spot.
No confusion between one or the other.
They swig, they hit.
Yes, the constant complaint about it exists,
but no other problems are reported about it.

Sure it is a big hammer for a small task.
But it is not like riding one's home of bugs
by detonating a thermal nuclear device.
Now that would be insane!
The cockroaches would survive.
:<i>)
</I>

&gt;<i> Two spells that instantly jump to mind are ffmpeg and net-tools.. it
</I>&gt;<i> took me a while to enable ping to be built on my box. :P
</I>
What did # augur forget
fail to allow those spells to reconfigure
on the next cast of those spells?
