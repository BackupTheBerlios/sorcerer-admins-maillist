Ah, I understand now.
That first entry which says device is there for a reason.
It is useful for something.
But I keep forgetting what that something is.

Now, after you partition a disk.
The partitions will show on that menu.
But one must know what to look for.

Let us say that the disk device that was partitioned
was /dev/sda
Then the first partition of /dev/sda is /dev/sda1
The second partition of /dev/sda is /dev/sda2

If the device partitioned was /dev/hda
Then the first partition of /dev/hda is /dev/hda1
The second partition of /dev/hda is /dev/hda2

Additional IDE devices will have names such as:
/dev/hdb
/dev/hdc
/dev/hdd

Additional SCSI devices will have names such as:
/dev/sda
/dev/sdb
/dev/sdc

If they exist then they can be partitioned.
There is an exception of course.
An ATA based CDROM will have a device name such as
/dev/hdb or /dev/hdc or /dev/hdd
However, a cdrom device can not be partitioned.

A SCSI based CDROM has a device name such as
/dev/sg0 or /dev/scd0 /dev/scd1
Yes it confuses SAs also from time to time.
But that aside create at least one partition for Sorcerer
and then select that partition in the fstab menu
in order to fill out the mount point of /
and the filesystem type of ext3
After that it is done.

Hmm, yes, that device at the top of that menu has a use,
but rarely would anyone want to use it.
Since it can be selected it is misleading.
I always assumed that SAs would select the partitions
beneath that corresponds to the partition that they
created for Sorcerer where they want to install it.

Sorry for the confusion.
I wonder what aught to be done about that menu?
