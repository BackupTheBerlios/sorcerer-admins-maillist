<PRE>The at spell did have problems with it.
Thanks for reporting it.
I used at commands more than a decade ago, but not since.
There was a time when it was good for sending
out an automated birthday card or having
a task start after one leaves work.
However, the more useful command is probably
the batch command.
The batch command was designed to be
able to execute commands when the CPU loadavg is low.

When computers were not nearly as powerful as they are now
batch was a useful command.
It is sort of like a printer spool for the CPU.
However, if one has something they want to run,
but also wants to use the CPU for other things
then the better choice is to start a command
and then renice all of it's processes to a high value.

Maximum nice value is probably 19.
I use 20 anyway.
Normal nice value for processes is 0.
Some kernel threads tend to run at nice -5
That makes 'em mean.
Mean processes gain more of the CPU sooner.
Nice processes tend to yield the CPU and use
fewer cycles unless a CPU core happens to be idle.
Even nice 20 processes will run at full bore
if nothing else requires the CPU.
However, if all CPU cores are loaded
then nice 20 processes will tend to use no
more than 5% of the CPU.
Roughly...
Imagine running 2 xz compression commands
concurrently on a single core CPU.
Roughly they would share the CPU 50/50
But if one of the commands was niced to 20
then sharing would be closer to 95/05

Negative nice values are also possible as I mentioned above.
However, using a negative nice value can be dangerous
since a -20 nice process running full bore on a single CPU
will try to starve off every other process.

Any user can raise the nice value of his proccesses.
Only root can lower nice values.
Therefore, a normal user should not ever be
able to renice a process to -20, not even their own processes.

Unless a SA or user has a specific need for at/batch
then the at/batch commands are mostly unused
on modern computers.
cronjobs in contrast still remain essential.

The reason I took time to explain at/batch
was because it is likely to unused these days.
In contrast nice and renice are very useful,
but also many SAs can get by for years without
every knowing or learning about nice.
Modern computers are so powerful
that one does not have to be nice in order to use them.  :)
However, on busy computers where several users
login and share resources then nicing one's
long duration processes is polite.
That way users who are actively logging in and running
commands will have their commands complete sooner
instead of having to share the CPU cores equally
with your processes that will be running for the next
few hours.

Knowing how to nice and write cronjobs
is more than enough to do periodic scheduling
of processes and to do CPU load balancing.
