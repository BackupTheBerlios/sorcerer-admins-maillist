<PRE>well I didn't read all the mail (I'm upset at work so I'm not sure I'll not
flame)
... but the first part I read was for me saying &quot;sorcerer is a fast car
without brakes&quot;

what prevent us to have some runlevel dedicated to interactive statup? in
what is it not doable? As far as I know it's allready working when I was
prompted for fsck issue.... and the logs were in
/etc/init.d/log.d/{sysinit,runlevel.$RUNLEVEL}
I ask it only in a sequential runlevel.... not in parallel ones....
I still believe that we won't have to give up on all that you said...
&quot;prompt the user and then?&quot; well I'll answer &quot;have someone maybe fix it?&quot;
from what I see now, is that we run services without control, it might work,
it might not work, if some service crash we have no way to fix it easely....
we have a fast car, without brake, and we force the driver to blind
himself.... good luck!


what prevent us to use locks? for me the concept of &quot;required&quot; and &quot;started
before&quot; has nothing different... this is only you that interpret it as such
for me that /var/locks shall be mounted tmps before starting someservice
means that the service somervice require service mount_locks_fs
for me if one service that require something to be run before it's run even
if it's to have a touched file (not relying on a process to be executing at
the same time) it require this service to be started....


I'm even more sure that we can achieve &quot;out of order stating&quot; : lauch ALL
/etc/rc.d/rc*.d/ scripts in parallel without ordering and if dependencies
are correct, have the services unlocking themselves in the right order.....

A requ B C D E
B req C
F req E

A &amp; B &amp; C &amp; D &amp; E &amp; F &amp;

A wait on B
B wait on C
C =&gt; free to run!
D =&gt; free to run!
E =&gt; free to run!
F wait on E
D free the lock...
E free the lock
F =&gt; free to run!
C free the lock...
B =&gt; free to run!
B free the lock
A =&gt; free to run!

execution order C D E F B A
C service if failing? D E F services will be executed, B and A who depends
on it won't.... this is safety!

as you see I don't even have to care about numbers..... it runs as fast as
possible! even the sorcery parallel boot won't achieve such speed

all we need is to have all startup scripts have the following line at end of
startup

setsid session_leader $0 $*

in session_leader script
------------------------------------
signal_handler() {
     kill -$sessionID
     sleep 2s
     kill -9 $sessionID
}

trap SIGTERM SIG.... signal_handler
required_service=parse_required $1;
service_name=$(basename $1);
#prevent same service to be run twice at the same time
if [ $2 == start ]; then
  lock /var/lock/$service_name;
  wait_on_lock ${required_service};
  #get back the start()/stop() function in namespace
  source $1;
  #execute the command
  $2;
  #free the other services
  echo $$ &gt; /var/PID/$service_name;
  #wait for child to end
  wait
  #free the service
  unlock /var/lock/$service_name;
else
  $2
  sleep 2s
  kill $(cat /var/PID/$service_name)
fi
--------------------------------------------------
wait_on_lock() {
  for args in $*; do
      while ! [ -e /var/PID/$arg ]; do
             #arctive poling? I don't know the lock mecanism
             sleep 1s
     done
}


with such script we unsure :
- all service are run in their own session leader
- killing the session leader will kill the spawned childs
- the PID file is reliable
- services can be run out of order
- you can even implement a timeout on starting scripts

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- there is no way to have a boot and &quot;stop on error&quot; process
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Correct, because output is not interactive,
</I>&gt;<i> but instead re-directed into a log file.
</I>&gt;<i> In some runlevels the process run backgrounded.
</I>&gt;<i> That is definitely non-interactive.
</I>&gt;<i> And while the controlling script might stay attached
</I>&gt;<i> to the console for runlevels the virtual console gettys
</I>&gt;<i> are always started prior to starting the runlevel.
</I>&gt;<i> That way a hang during runlevel execution can
</I>&gt;<i> not cause a situation where the no one can log into the box.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To implement a step by step interactive boot
</I>&gt;<i> requires that all of the above be sacrificed.
</I>&gt;<i> No more /etc/init.d/log.d/{sysinit,runlevel.$RUNLEVEL}
</I>&gt;<i> No more parallel execution of init-scripts during boot.
</I>&gt;<i> No more starting login gettys before completing runlevel.
</I>&gt;<i> It must all stay attached and sequential.
</I>&gt;<i> That is a lot to give up!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also if a problem becomes evident because something ran
</I>&gt;<i> such as dmsetup
</I>&gt;<i> then is there is no error report, because it ran just fine,
</I>&gt;<i> and the problem already exists by the time that
</I>&gt;<i> a problem due to it is encountered.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of a &quot;stop on error&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> are you not wishing more for a &quot;stop before error?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Not so easy to do?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You want to prompt before each init-script is run?
</I>&gt;<i> # ls /etc/init.d | wc -l
</I>&gt;<i> 154
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is approximately a meager 150 pauses
</I>&gt;<i> for SA input during boot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) if you deactivate partially some start service (for exemple the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first dm service) other service depending on it might be run,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there is no real check if a required service
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has or not effectively started or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a check.
</I>&gt;<i> It is done by the use of lock files.
</I>&gt;<i> I ommitted implementing those checks on purpose,
</I>&gt;<i> because it merely makes init-scripts slower.
</I>&gt;<i> And I would also have to mount a tmpfs on /var/lock.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the situation you describe I could also have the
</I>&gt;<i> init-script dmsetup check that the dm-mod module is loaded.
</I>&gt;<i> But that is pointless since it would be loaded unless
</I>&gt;<i> the SA disabled that init-script.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At one time all of the dm stuff would be in one hard
</I>&gt;<i> to understand slow to execute init-script.
</I>&gt;<i> However, by breaking it up into separate init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> then I gain the full benefit of using role specific init-script
</I>&gt;<i> design where the entire role of an init-script is to load a module
</I>&gt;<i> or is to mount a filesystem.
</I>&gt;<i> Then if something does not go according to plan
</I>&gt;<i> then a little red string prints instead of silently
</I>&gt;<i> not acknowledging the error as if it was a single modprobe
</I>&gt;<i> line in a much larger and more complicated init-script.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in my case mdadm--assemble has not stated because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've no config file... however all service that rely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; upon this service are still launched!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in cryptsetup script I see : required-start : dmsetup
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> cryptsetup does require a device mapper,
</I>&gt;<i> but does not require the use of LVM2.
</I>&gt;<i> In many cases the requirement you see
</I>&gt;<i> does not specify that the afore mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> service is required.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead it merely ensure that the afore mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> service starts before this service.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BUT if I remove dmsetup from the /etc/rc.d/rcS directory.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... then do exec /init, then login as root on password prompt,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cat /etc/init.d/log.d/sysinit | grep crypt,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I see that the service has started!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a required service has never started but the script
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is still launched! OUCH!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is a complaint that should be filed with the people
</I>&gt;<i> who created the design for LSB init-scripts, because
</I>&gt;<i> there is no separate way to specify the difference between
</I>&gt;<i> a service that is required and a service that should be
</I>&gt;<i> started prior.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> dmsetup should be started before LUKS encryption.
</I>&gt;<i> However, dmsetup is not required to implement LUKS encryption.
</I>&gt;<i> Only the device-mapper module must be loaded.
</I>&gt;<i> And sometimes modules such as dm-mod
</I>&gt;<i> would be load automatically when required
</I>&gt;<i> by a program that needs them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) there shall be an entry stepbystep_init in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lilo menu that prompt the root for password
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at beginning of /init and ask him at each start
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of a service if he wants to start it and stop if error
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While not impossible to accomplish
</I>&gt;<i> it can not simply be laid ontop of what already exists.
</I>&gt;<i> The implementation would likely require the specification
</I>&gt;<i> of a runlevel as kernel parameter.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, nothing is defined as runlevel 7.
</I>&gt;<i> So the necessary code could be added as runlevel 7.
</I>&gt;<i> Why the new runlevel?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1: init-scripts must be run wrapped.
</I>&gt;<i> 2: they must be run sequentially.
</I>&gt;<i> 3: they must be run attached
</I>&gt;<i> 4: if it is even possible then
</I>&gt;<i>   the start of virtual console login gettys
</I>&gt;<i>   must be postponed until the runlevel finishes execution.
</I>&gt;<i> 5: this probably requires a new or modified installation
</I>&gt;<i>   of /etc/inittab to accomplish 4:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And what to do in the case of an error?
</I>&gt;<i> Allow the person at console to temporarily open
</I>&gt;<i> a shell and then
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4)/etc/init.d/log.d/* files shall be stripped of any color escaping
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; characters that are sure beautiful at console
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but pain in the less....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> try:
</I>&gt;<i> cat /etc/init.d/log.d/runlevel.* | sed 's:.\[[0-9][0-9]m::g'
</I>&gt;<i> The sed statement will probably only remove color codes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this is just an idea, but instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; creating symlinks into /etc/rc.d/*/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; why not create a whole bash script which will have lines like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to create a BSD style init
</I>&gt;<i> where one absurdly complicated script controls everything
</I>&gt;<i> then go ahead and try.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But it would be a huge step backwards on Sorcerer .
</I>&gt;<i> Tthe modular System-V style init enables components
</I>&gt;<i> to be easily added or removed.
</I>&gt;<i> For example:
</I>&gt;<i> cryptsetup can be removed.
</I>&gt;<i> LVM2 used to be removable, but is currently held down by lilo.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the init-scripts installed by LVM2
</I>&gt;<i> can still be disabled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The beauty of the symbolic link sysvinit style with runlevel directories
</I>&gt;<i> is that the scripts are pre-ordered to execute in proper order.
</I>&gt;<i> It is not as if the the scripts execute in random order.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -----------------snap
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; start_service /etc/init.d/dm-mod
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; started_service dm-mod &amp;&amp; cryptsetup
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ----------------end snap
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could have every init-script that requires dm-mod module
</I>&gt;<i> to be loaded to execute a mod-probe
</I>&gt;<i> or check for a lock file in /var/lock
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is not something of such great importance
</I>&gt;<i> that it requires the additional time every boot
</I>&gt;<i> to redundantly and repeatedly check.
</I>&gt;<i> Probably the only way dm-mod module does not load
</I>&gt;<i> is if the SA disabled the init-script.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # chmod 600 /etc/init.d/dm-mod
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can create lock files in /var/lock/
</I>&gt;<i> to track the successful execution of every init-script
</I>&gt;<i> I never implemented the code because it seemed to be
</I>&gt;<i> a waste that slows down booting.
</I>&gt;<i> Besides the outcome of many init-scripts can either
</I>&gt;<i> be checked with a grep or a process ID.
</I>&gt;<i> Not states that I must do locking to indicate
</I>&gt;<i> what services have successfully started and/or
</I>&gt;<i> which have failed.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, I do not do it.
</I>&gt;<i> For the most part it only requires some modifications
</I>&gt;<i> to /lib/lsb/init-functions rather than having to
</I>&gt;<i> modify every init-script in /etc/init.d/
</I>&gt;<i> However, checking for lock files does require
</I>&gt;<i> specific init-script modification.
</I>&gt;<i> The LSB specifications do not specify the difference
</I>&gt;<i> between an init-script that is listed merely for
</I>&gt;<i> ordering purposes as compared with an init-script
</I>&gt;<i> that is listed because it must successfully complete
</I>&gt;<i> prior to starting the current init-script.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand what you are communicating.
</I>&gt;<i> You do not want to be run-over and run-down
</I>&gt;<i> by a non-stop-able init train of events.
</I>&gt;<i> The alternative is purty much a 100 to 200
</I>&gt;<i> stopping stations inserted on the line.
</I>&gt;<i> Then the SA must fully conduct and steer
</I>&gt;<i> the init-process approving each stop
</I>&gt;<i> before it happens.
</I>&gt;<i> Booting a box would become a serious chore
</I>&gt;<i> in that fashion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming that it is set to stop on error instead
</I>&gt;<i> of pause before each init-script executes
</I>&gt;<i> then an error must be correctable to be of any use.
</I>&gt;<i> And if the SA is expecting an error to happen
</I>&gt;<i> then the SA must carefully step through each init-script
</I>&gt;<i> to intercept and pre-empt the error.
</I>&gt;<i> If not handled on a script-by-script basis
</I>&gt;<i> then a menu must be displayed before booting
</I>&gt;<i> that allows the SA to select stop points and
</I>&gt;<i> to selectively disable init-scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> And it would have to be done twice,
</I>&gt;<i> once for sysinit and once for runlevel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From my perspective:
</I>&gt;<i> Problems that occur during runlevel
</I>&gt;<i> are not worth correcting until runlevel completes.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually such problems are not catastrophic.
</I>&gt;<i> The worst problems reported thus far is that
</I>&gt;<i> the X server starts without keyboard/pointer input.
</I>&gt;<i> And that could be avoided by putting 3
</I>&gt;<i> on the kernel command line to boot runlevel 3,
</I>&gt;<i> fix the problem then reboot into default runlevel 4 or 5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Problems that occur during sysinit are rare
</I>&gt;<i> and can be the most problematic since
</I>&gt;<i> such problems might prevent mounting of
</I>&gt;<i> the real root filesytem.
</I>&gt;<i> In that situation I want full control.
</I>&gt;<i> And full control over what happens means
</I>&gt;<i> that I must start using rdinit=/bin/bash
</I>&gt;<i> That way I gain a prompt and can control
</I>&gt;<i> what executes.
</I>&gt;<i> I can set the PATH and then begin executing
</I>&gt;<i> init-scripts in /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/ up until the point
</I>&gt;<i> where I expect a problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SAs aught not be afraid of doing some trouble-shooting
</I>&gt;<i> using a command prompt instead of a menu.
</I>&gt;<i> A menu is both a convenience and a crutch,
</I>&gt;<i> because it exposes and makes easy certain pre-determined
</I>&gt;<i> paths while obscuring alternatives that might be better to use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If SAs agree
</I>&gt;<i> then I can implement locking that shows from inspecting
</I>&gt;<i> of /var/lock/{fail,work}/ the outcome of init-scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> Since it will likely be implemented by wrapping init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> to check the return value
</I>&gt;<i> then it will cost approximately twice the usually PID allocation
</I>&gt;<i> and /bin/dash execution of the current method of booting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anything that interactively modifies the execution of runlevel
</I>&gt;<i> requires a new /etc/inittab and new runlevel 7 to implement.
</I>&gt;<i> Does not seem a good choice
</I>&gt;<i> since a SA should be able to correct errors that happen
</I>&gt;<i> during runlevel after runlevel execution completes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> sysinit always runs in series.
</I>&gt;<i> The init-scripts run during sysinit tend to be tiny and fast.
</I>&gt;<i> Since virtual consoles are not started until after sysinit ends
</I>&gt;<i> then sysinit can be made more or less interactive.
</I>&gt;<i> I prefer to debug it with initrd=/bin/bash
</I>&gt;<i> However, if desired I can create
</I>&gt;<i> /init.debug
</I>&gt;<i> /init.debug would be like init except it would contain
</I>&gt;<i> extra menus for selection of such things as:
</I>&gt;<i> which init-scripts to execute;
</I>&gt;<i> option menu before execution;
</I>&gt;<i> shell on failures, etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are about 40 to 50 init-scripts that execute during sysinit.
</I>&gt;<i> Although I do not know exactly how interactive debugging
</I>&gt;<i> of sysinit should happen by menus I can at least try to
</I>&gt;<i> hack an initial implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> Naturally, after trying it,
</I>&gt;<i> improvements would be made due to SA feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> And it could be selected during boot by adding:
</I>&gt;<i> rdinit=/init.debug
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> LSB comment controlled style System 5 init
</I>&gt;<i> has some short-comings.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet overall it seems more flexible than a BSD style init.
</I>&gt;<i> I rather not create a system for controlling init
</I>&gt;<i> that relies upon a single file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, merely having /etc/inittab is troublesome.
</I>&gt;<i> A single file controls too much of what happens during init.
</I>&gt;<i> I can not replace /etc/inittab distribution wide
</I>&gt;<i> because some SAs have modified
</I>&gt;<i> more than merely the default runlevel.
</I>&gt;<i> The number of gettys and the getty programs
</I>&gt;<i> might also be modified.
</I>&gt;<i> Replacing /etc/inittab yet preserving the default
</I>&gt;<i> runlevel might still inconvenience some SAs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, changes that involve modifying
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/inittab seem nearly too high a cost
</I>&gt;<i> compared to providing a convenience that
</I>&gt;<i> many SAs might never use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly the overhead for using lockfiles and checks
</I>&gt;<i> still outweighs the benefits and therefore will
</I>&gt;<i> not be implemented without a compelling arugment
</I>&gt;<i> that illuminates all the banes and boons and shows
</I>&gt;<i> how the boons significant outweigh the banes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In summary I will create an alternate:
</I>&gt;<i> /init.debug
</I>&gt;<i> It can be selected during boot by using a kernel parameter:
</I>&gt;<i> rdinit=/init.debug
</I>&gt;<i> It will only provide interaction while sysinit is running
</I>&gt;<i> and when runlevel is reached the box will continue
</I>&gt;<i> booting normally as if /init had run instead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That seems like an adequate compromise.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the initial implementation
</I>&gt;<i> might be less than desirable.
</I>&gt;<i> And the final implementation
</I>&gt;<i> might accomplish less than expected.
</I>&gt;<i> However, given your example situation
</I>&gt;<i> where the omission of running certain
</I>&gt;<i> init-scripts provided a booting solution
</I>&gt;<i> this goal I can work towards making easier to accomplish.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is the execution of:
</I>&gt;<i> /sbin/dmsetup mknodes
</I>&gt;<i> causing the unwanted locking?
</I>&gt;<i> What is causing the unwanted locking?
</I>&gt;<i> Congrats on finding a way around the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> But more precisely what is the problem
</I>&gt;<i> and why is it happening, please?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we know more about the problem then
</I>&gt;<i> we might be able to script around it in some cases,
</I>&gt;<i> or undo the problem,
</I>&gt;<i> or alert the SA what could be causing the problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When
</I>&gt;<i> /sbin/dmsetup mkdnods
</I>&gt;<i> executes
</I>&gt;<i> what does it create in /dev/mapper/
</I>&gt;<i> other than:
</I>&gt;<i> crw------- 1 root root 10, 60 Jun 17 07:35 /dev/mapper/control
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there something in there such as a:
</I>&gt;<i> luks-hda2
</I>&gt;<i> Anything to suggest that a partition is
</I>&gt;<i> being detected as part of something
</I>&gt;<i> that it is no longer part of?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am still curious as to the cause of the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is probably not distribution wide,
</I>&gt;<i> but there might be something that can be changed
</I>&gt;<i> in order to help prevent the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Do partitions have the wrong ID number?
</I>&gt;<i> Were they previously part of a md-raid, LVM2,
</I>&gt;<i> or LUKS encrypted partition?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I want to expect that if something about
</I>&gt;<i> the setup of the device mapper is causing problems
</I>&gt;<i> then those problems are due to something
</I>&gt;<i> odd about the partitions.
</I>&gt;<i> But so far that is merely an assumption
