<PRE>I did not remove gphoto2 and gimp.

I removed: cdf; idlastro; and many other spells.
If I discarded anything important
then please fix the spell so
the source can do a DESTDIR complaint install
and re-instate the spells into the grimoire.

As for the spells I removed,
I avoided selecting any that were bases in
long requirement chain of spells.
For example, I could not possibly remove zlib, glibc,
ncurses and other such spells.
A huge pile of other spells sits upon them.
Spells that were removed looked to be
not DESTDIR compatible and
did not have other spells requiring them.
For the most part they were lone.
Therefore, their removal would not create
holes in installed software.

One exception to the above is libcaca.
It generates screens of
colored text character
that represent a graphic images.
It is a bit abstract and difficult to discern the graphic image.
While amusing it is of no use on a modern box.
It was optionally required by a few video players.
But since libcaca is no longer under development,
along with it's precursor aalib or something like that,
it is best to remove it before it breaks.
And probably I removed it also because
it does not have a DESTDIR compatible install.

My point is that I tried not to blow holes in software
by removing potentially important spells.
I apologize for damage caused by removing
spells for sources that were not DESTDIR compliant.
However, I did not discard spells quickly on a whim.
I checked, edited, and fixed thousands of spells.
It required days of effort.
I was not merely pulling a few weeds out of the garden.
