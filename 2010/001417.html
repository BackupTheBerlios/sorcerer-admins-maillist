&gt;<i> could someone please tell me how to install sorcerer linux as my only operating system in laymans terms ie what to type from partition to completion step by step because i keep getting errors like failed to mount and such thanks.
</I>
The exact commands to type to create a partition
with fdisk vary depending upon whether the disk is empty
or already contains a partition.
However, fdisk is a necessary step.
Even if a partition already exists
with fdisk the partition type can be changed
and the partition can be marked as bootable
or not bootable.
By default fdisk normally creates a partition type
that is appropriate for a linux filesystem.
However, it will not normally mark a partition as bootable.
However, Sorcerer's menu driven installer will probably
do that if the SA forgets.

Now in addition to having a partition
a filesystem must be create on that partition.
This can be done with the mkfs command
or several other commands depending upon
what filesystem one wants to install.
xfs and reiserfs and other exotic filesystem types
tend to have different command line programs
for creating those filesystems.
Fortunately, a SA does not have to learn
those program names or parameters if the SA
is using the Sorcerer menu driven installer.

However, the SA must visit the fstab menu
and specify which partition should be /
and the filesystem type for it.
I used ext3 on /
However, other SAs might want to try ext4,
although ext4 has not been available for long.
ext3 has been available for almost a decade.

Now that the menu driven installer knows which
partition should be / and what filesystem should be on it
please visit the file system initialization menu.
On this menu please remember to highlight the partition
and pres space so that the check-mark or [x]
is filled into the brackets.
Then, pressing enter will indicate to the menu driven installer
that the filesystem should be created.
It will double check with the SA
that it has permission to remove all data on that partition.

My guess is that upon visiting this menu
that some SAs might be unfamiliar with how to use
dialog's checklist.
dialog is the program used for Sorcerer's menu driven install.
The reason for this selection is because lxdialog,
a variant of dialog, is used for the kernel's make menuconfig.
In the past all Sorcerer SAs were expected to be able to
successfully complete a make menuconfig on the linux kernel.
And that required the skill of being able to use dialog.

Perhaps the use of dialog is not intuitive for all new SAs?
Unfortunate if that is the case;
never the less dialog should be mastered because
almost any menu presented in the sorcery tools
is generated using dialog.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
