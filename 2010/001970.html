<PRE>&gt;<i>From the linux-custom camp:
</I>
Apart from lightning fast compilations, fast boot times and a lean
/boot, linux-custom offers the ability to run without initramfs by
building everything needed into the kernel.

It also offers the ability to explicitly turn off hardware that is not
required/dodgey.

So it's well worth the time tuning the config for linux-custom. This
localmodconfig thing looks like it could be a great help for
linux-custom. It requires building the full linux spell, booting it
once, and then updating the linux config spell, right? I have trouble
seeing how it would help someone running the linux spell, apart from
helping that person cast the linux-custom spell.  :)

hmm.....

It seems worth the trouble on a build box where the hardware is not
going to change for years and years, but the kernel might be re-built
a few times.

Saying all that, the linux spell has the benefit that you just don't
have to care about what gets plugged into the machine, and also you
are able to run your linux on many different boxes... Ideal for
installers and people who don't rebuild/reboot their boxes all too
often.

I'm glad that we have the choice between lean and all-you-can-eat when
it comes to linux kernel in Sorcerer.

Thanks for all the hard work, Kyle.

I normally have trouble figuring out whether [x] mean on or off.

What would have been helpful, would be consistency across the
spells... or, consider the following two equivalent spell options:

[ ] with $OPTION
[x] without $OPTION

To me that would mean this option is not run, right? If we make &quot;with&quot;
and &quot;without&quot; standard across spells, then we could pick and choose
the defaults for spells without confusion.
