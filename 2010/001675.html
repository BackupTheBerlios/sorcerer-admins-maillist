Almost nothing works 100% of the time for 100% of all cases.
Overall the use of PID files works good in almost all cases.
PIDs for a session leader seem to also be the SID.
If that assumption is okay
then we do not have to guess at what number the SID should be.


&gt;<i> Let's take the example of a broken service that spawn several child then

</I>&gt;<i> so I think we need both
</I>
While a bit on the rare side
that problem obviously can not be solved with a PID file.
It might be solvable using a SID if all children
are within the original session.
The SID would probably be the PID of the session leader
that has already exited or crashed.
If the SID is treated as a SID instead of a PID
then that should work.

&gt;<i> another annoying thing is that I would like to have a way to stop on each
</I>&gt;<i> error of service start and stop at startup and shutdown.
</I>
Once a runlevel change is requested
what happens next is automatic and non interactive.

There are rare cases during sysinit
and/or during shutdown where
a message is displayed and a timed option
for the SA to present the root password in
order to obtain a root prompt is granted.
Only someone sitting at the console can
provide the root password and gain a root prompt.

sysinit and shutdow/restart are special
because as far as runlevels go they do not
have TTYs/virtual consoles.
If someone runs telinit or
switches the runlevel
I doubt there is a way to interact
directly with that person.
At best a sulogin could be presented
for a console login if someone happens
to be at the console, knows the root password,
and is looking at the console and not X.


&gt;<i> I noticed that several services display red error lines... but never have
</I>&gt;<i> time to see what the process neither investigate... so I think that a &quot;debug
</I>&gt;<i> services&quot; boot option could be a good help.
</I>
Most &quot;red&quot; messages are not fatal.
Most would not interrupt the booting process.
Almost all of the worst potential problems have
a contingency plan.
Please take the next two cases as examples:

1. If udev fails
then device nodes can be restored
from a previously saved dev directory
and modules are loaded in correct order
from a previously saved list.

2. If / is not specified in /etc/fstab
then someone at the console is prompted
to select / from a list of block devices.

Messages saved from sysinit,
the kernel ring buffer, and runlevels
can be reviewed in the logs stored at
/etc/init.d/log.d/
Therefore, those messages are not lost
if not immediately investigated.
After a box finishes booting
the SA can then decide to handle/investigate the
red messages or ignore them.


&gt;<i> If this option is set,
</I>&gt;<i> sequential launch of services shall be enforced, each service that don't
</I>&gt;<i> start shall prompt the root password, the same shall be done when stopping
</I>&gt;<i> services at the end.
</I>
For boxes that have at least one red message
the timeout could create an excessively long
reboot/boot start-up time.
Not a great idea since SAs start to panic if a box
does not become available for login within 3
minutes after issuing a remote reboot request.

The primary purpose of sysinit and the runlevel
is to get the box up and booted so that someone
can log in or the box can start providing services.
It should do so with as much automation as possible.
If the SA must fix something
then the SA should enter
rdinit=/bin/bash
as a linux kernel parameter.
Then the SA will gain full control of
the box prior to the box running /init
on the initramfs.

If a box can boot and mount the real / filesystem
then this is best.
Why?
Because ctrl-c does not work for process 1,
the SA can not abort programs when interacting
on console or while running process 1.
The SA is provided with no virtual consoles.
Solving problems after a box finishes booting
is usually much better than pausing/interrupting
the boot sequence and allowing the SA to
try to do something about them then.
I also tend to conjecture that fixing problems
after booting completes tends to be safer.
Any problem that led to a cascade of failures
can usually be solved by fixing and running
a few init-scripts in sequence.

If thorough debugging is required
then the SA should probably start with
rdinit=/bin/bash

One of the reasons why scroll might overwrite
the login prompt on a Sorcerer box is because
gettys on virtual consoles are enabled prior to
the start of the runlevel.
That way no hang or problem in the runlevel execution
can keep the SA from being able to log in.
Sorcerer boxes are design to try to achieve
as normal a state as possible and provide a login
so that an remaining errors can at that point
be fixed by the SA.

Does anyone else want an interactive booting process?
I can only guess how to do it for sysinit.
Since the runlevel is started by /sbin/init
and happens in the traditional non-interactive way,
pause and interruption of runlevel execution
does not have an obvious method.
When runlevel executes init-scripts in parallel
no method for interruption and pause is possible.

Does anyone have an idea where
having booting stop and allowing the SA
a shell prompt would be useful?

&gt;<i> thanks and regards
</I>
I am thinking about it.
Nothing comes to mind where
interaction is require during boot
where a method for interaction is not
already provided.
Worst case scenarios still require
booting with rdinit=/bin/bash
And second to worst case scenarios
fail to mount the real / and
keep the initramfs mounted as /
Anything worse than a worse case scenario,
such as the kernel or initramfs being corrupted
or a problem with lilo's installation to the boot block
and/or MBR those types of rescues require
an Install/Rescue disk.
