The update already went out in the last LAG=0 grimoire.
It compiles.
Whether it runs okay I do not know.
Today I am playing with trying to make thunderbird compile.
I doubt anyone is using it.


&gt;<i> KDE is a lot of junk that I'm not using,
</I>
Now that is an interesting observation.
To make a point about how the new KDE-v4
compilation method is superior and customizable
I created the very fancy kdeedu-v4 spell
The spell has a huge amount of switches that can be used
to disable the compilation and installation of many
sub-components of kdeedu that might not be of interest.
kig = KDE interactive geometry
khangman = a word/phrase guessing game.
kalgebra = x = y + z
Really, I do not use any of that.
I only use the kiten Japanese/English dictionary.
So I have most of kdeedu-v4 disabled
and therefore it tends to compile quickly
and not require much disk space.

Something similar can be done for nearly all kde*-v4 spells.
But no SAs have expressed an interest in creating
very slim and precise KDE installations.

KDE has a lot of junk in the trunk,
but that does not prevent the SA
from deciding to put it on a diet to achieve a slim installation.
In order to rework the other KDE spells we only need SAs
to express some interest in having it done.
Otherwise I will be allocating time to improving other things.

&gt;<i> and since I end up with most
</I>&gt;<i> of gnome just to play with monodevelop (which doesn't have a spell, I
</I>&gt;<i> should have noted the missing dependancies, but gnome-sharp wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> happy about building and
</I>
gnome is considerably more fragmented than KDE,
but also a serious tangle of programs that is difficult to visualize.
Recently, I was testing to see if libIDL and ORBit2 can be
deprecated.
Yet they are still required by at-spi.
And although at-spi2-atk and at-spi2-core exist to eventually
replace at-spi; those new spells do not yet act as drop-in replacements.
And a few gnome programs that require the at-spi accessibility
library therefore also pin down libIDL and ORBit2.
However, I read that eventually the use of cobra orbs
will be deprecated from GNOME.
and libIDL has an annoying requirement on an old version of bison.


&gt;<i> I think mono-addins is missing a dependancy
</I>&gt;<i> on like gtk-sharp or something )
</I>
Thanks for finding that.
I added it to the spell.


&gt;<i> I dunno, do KDE packages play well with creating startup shortcuts in
</I>&gt;<i> the program menu when installed?
</I>&gt;<i> or is it still a manual feat to
</I>&gt;<i> attach a KDE thing to the menu - at which point, it becomes easier to
</I>&gt;<i> just launch from a terminal.
</I>
There was a discussion about that.
Installing a standard something.desktop file in
/usr/share/applications/
will cause the software to show up on menus.
firefox is a good example of that.
those *.desktop files is about as easy as copy and edit.

However having KDE applications appear on other
desktop environment menus is not so easy.
Partly, because KDE installs in /opt/kde4/
and partly since it would not use the */share/applications/
directory in a flat manner, but also would have subdirectories.
