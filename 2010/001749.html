</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, no breaks.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> If it does not break
</I>&gt;<i> then it does not require fixing.
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally, I wish it could be that way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>yes but sadely it won't..... there are always unseen cases that will require
manual fixing....


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what prevent us to have some runlevel dedicated to interactive statup? in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what is it not doable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, it requires that /etc/inittab also be modified.
</I>&gt;<i> I could try to sedit in the required line,
</I>&gt;<i> but that might not work because it requires an assumption
</I>&gt;<i> that /etc/inittab looks something like the one provided by
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> Sediting a heavily modified /etc/inittab might not work.
</I>&gt;<i> Installing a new default /etc/inittab replacing customized
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/initab might irritate and inconvenience SAs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>what has to be modified in inittab?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The best way to make any modification to
</I>&gt;<i> the selection of init-scripts run during runlevel
</I>&gt;<i> is to handle that at the very end of sysinit.
</I>&gt;<i> Only when sysinit ends do the virtual consoles gettys
</I>&gt;<i> become activated.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, there exists an opportunity
</I>&gt;<i> for one last attempt at interaction.
</I>&gt;<i> Once runlevels start the action is fire and forget.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>not sure I well understood.......


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And is that really so bad?
</I>&gt;<i> The most sensitive parts of booting
</I>&gt;<i> happen before runlevel execution begins.
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing about runlevel execution should cause the box
</I>&gt;<i> to enter into a state where the kernel is crashed
</I>&gt;<i> or login is impossible,
</I>&gt;<i> provided that the Linux-PAM installation was not already broke.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>well seems that this assumption is incorrect since it happens that something
about runlevel execution cause the login to be impossible since the rootfs
is inaccessible.... yes you can login into the ramdisk but rootfs is
inaccessible


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As far as I know it's allready working when I was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prompted for fsck issue.... and the logs were in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; /etc/init.d/log.d/{sysinit,runlevel.$RUNLEVEL}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> fscking only happens during sysinit.
</I>&gt;<i> By the time runlevel begins a real root filesystem
</I>&gt;<i> should be mounted read/write on /
</I>&gt;<i> and therefore fscking should not be possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>yes I agree


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I ask it only in a sequential runlevel.... not in parallel ones....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I still believe that we won't have to give up on all that you said...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;prompt the user and then?&quot; well I'll answer &quot;have someone maybe fix it?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from what I see now, is that we run services without control, it might
</I>&gt;<i> work,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it might not work, if some service crash we have no way to fix it
</I>&gt;<i> easely....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we have a fast car, without brake, and we force the driver to blind
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; himself.... good luck!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The runlevel log is far from being blind.
</I>&gt;<i> Since about 100 init-scripts run during runlevel
</I>&gt;<i> I can not read screen scroll fast enough.
</I>&gt;<i> If I saw some unusual red
</I>&gt;<i> then I check the runlevel log.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>the problem arise when red lines occurs on runlevel 0 or 6..... how do you
check a runlevel log that is no more?
seems that there are issue unmounting drive because I'm not the only one to
have fsck clean some orphan on startup....
services are in my opinion one of the most important part of the stability
of the box.... all red lines require immediate SA intervention in my
opinion.... warnings lines only require from time to time checks and I would
like to have an INFO lines instead of warning for information such as
startup of service....



&gt;<i> As I mentioned before an interactive runlevel requires
</I>&gt;<i> not only sequential foreground wrapped execution of init-scripts,
</I>&gt;<i> but it also requires a modification of /etc/inittab in order to delay
</I>&gt;<i> the startup of gettys until after runlevel execution completes.
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally, the way to have that is to create special debug
</I>&gt;<i> runlevel 7 that occurs in the /etc/inittab
</I>&gt;<i> before the lines for virtual consoles begin.
</I>&gt;<i> Ideal placement would be after si: and ca:
</I>&gt;<i> assuming ca: occurs before vc[1-6]:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As long as the ca: line exists in /etc/inittab
</I>&gt;<i> and has not moved relative to the other lines
</I>&gt;<i> then it could be used as an anchor point
</I>&gt;<i> inserting the runlevel line just below it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>not sure that it's a good idea.... I think that kernel parameter is a better
idea....


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what prevent us to use locks?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There was no obvious gain for the cost of implementing it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for me the concept of &quot;required&quot; and &quot;started
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before&quot; has nothing different
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, but it is different.
</I>&gt;<i> In the LSB comment section of an init-script
</I>&gt;<i> the Required-Start: and Should-Start:
</I>&gt;<i> both are used merely as tools for ordering init-scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> Take the /etc/init.d/lock init-script for example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ### BEGIN INIT INFO
</I>&gt;<i> # Required-Start: proc
</I>&gt;<i> # Default-Start: S 1 2 3 4 5
</I>&gt;<i> # Short-Description: lock mounts tmpfs on /var/lock
</I>&gt;<i> ### END INIT INFO
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why does it have Required-Start: proc?
</I>&gt;<i> Must /proc be mounted in order to mount /var/lock?
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously there is no relationship.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>maybe not... maybe.... /etc/mtab is usually a link to /proc/mounts or used
to be....
this means that to mount other fs proc has to be mounted...


&gt;<i> Several init-scripts, especially ones that will run during sysinit,
</I>&gt;<i> have a Required-Start: proc
</I>&gt;<i> merely in order to assure that /proc
</I>&gt;<i> is one of the first init-scripts run during sysinit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # ls /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S0[01]* | cat
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S00loopback
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S00media_root
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S00proc
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S01coldplug
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S01dev
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S01hostname
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S01lock
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S01loglevel
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S01run
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S01sys
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On my workstation proc is not mounted first.
</I>&gt;<i> But it starts soon enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I still don't see what is the difference....  anyway if proc service has no
Required-Start then it'll obviously fail in S00.... if this is just to have
/proc mounted in the first steps... well fine... what is the problem? what
prevent to do it? nothing... neither the LSB nor anybody prevent it... it's
not against the rules... you can list in Required-Star whatever service the
linux distribution decide to be started before...


&gt;<i> &gt; this is only you that interpret it as such
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for me that /var/locks shall be mounted tmps before starting someservice
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means that the service somervice require service mount_locks_fs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for me if one service that require something to be run before it's run
</I>&gt;<i> even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if it's to have a touched file (not relying on a process to be executing
</I>&gt;<i> at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same time) it require this service to be started....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That sounds fine.
</I>&gt;<i> However, init-scripts do not know
</I>&gt;<i> the difference between a Required-Start:
</I>&gt;<i> that is used merely for ordering
</I>&gt;<i> and a Required-Start: that indicates the specified
</I>&gt;<i> init-script or service must have executed prior and
</I>&gt;<i> completed successfully.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Besides...
</I>&gt;<i> Creating cascading auto-failures during init-script
</I>&gt;<i> execution is not desirable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If lock files were created then what?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>lock shall be tmpfs.....


&gt;<i> Check for them and fail entire chains of init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> because an earlier init-script failed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>what do you prefer? have the system stop and wait for fixes or try to force
it running and have un-predictable side effects?  at this time writing we
have the second behavior.... it might work, it might not work, it might
destroy lot of files.... you can't tell me that you can insure me that a
service that WILL misbehave if another isn't started won't be started if the
other isn't..... especially because I HAVE THE CASE....


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not every box has networking started by
</I>&gt;<i> the networks init-script.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet the init-script for /etc/init.d/sshd
</I>&gt;<i> on almost every box will start something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #!/bin/bash
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ### BEGIN INIT INFO
</I>&gt;<i> # Required-Start: $network empty ssh-keygen run
</I>&gt;<i> # Required-Stop:  $network
</I>&gt;<i> # Default-Start: 2 3 4 5
</I>&gt;<i> # Default-Stop: 0 1 6
</I>&gt;<i> # Short-Description: sshd provides server for secure encrypted remote
</I>&gt;<i> logins.
</I>&gt;<i> ### END INIT INFO
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So would you want to sshd to not be started if
</I>&gt;<i> the script specified by $network failed when it ran?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>YES


&gt;<i> Would you want sshd to not be stopped if
</I>&gt;<i> the init-script that controls $networks
</I>&gt;<i> did not successfully stop?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>wrong assumption... stop occurs in reverse order.... anyway in my point of
view if sshd stop don't work this require IMMEDIATE SA ATTENTION, ALL
STARTED SERVICES SHALL BE STOPABLE

Furthermore, how do init-scripts check for
&gt;<i> a lockfile from $network
</I>&gt;<i> when $network specifies a generic service name
</I>&gt;<i> rather than a specific init-script?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>if multiple init script provide the same service name only one shall be run.
there shall be only one $network lock file, containing a pid of the service
handler....


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oddly enough the /etc/init.d/networks init-script
</I>&gt;<i> writes a locfile /var/lock/networks
</I>&gt;<i> That is only used to indicate for the init-script
</I>&gt;<i> networks that networks was previously started.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>well that's bad...


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm even more sure that we can achieve &quot;out of order stating&quot; : lauch ALL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/ scripts in parallel without ordering and if dependencies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are correct, have the services unlocking themselves in the right
</I>&gt;<i> order.....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even init systems designed to create the illusion
</I>&gt;<i> of being able to start every init-script in parallel without ordering
</I>&gt;<i> merely start ahead of those services other services to
</I>&gt;<i> act as stand-ins.
</I>&gt;<i> There is no effective way to create a true
</I>&gt;<i> orderless concurrent execution of init-scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> Some things absolutely must happen before other thins.
</I>&gt;<i> Forget about trying to start them all at once
</I>&gt;<i> and having them unlock and run in correct order.
</I>&gt;<i> It would be slow for the kernel to handle
</I>&gt;<i> and cause wear and tear on mechanical fixed-disks
</I>&gt;<i> that have their heads constantly hopping all around
</I>&gt;<i> the disks reading bits and pieces of files that are all
</I>&gt;<i> being requested rather concurrently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I still don't agree... it's doable with signals.... you can stop a process
anytime in sleeping and wake it up.... all that you require is atomical (ie
locked) write to a file in order to store the pid of the service that want
to be woken by the required service. Then have the waiting service sleep for
the timeout, and have it trap SIGUSR1 for example.... once the required
service decide that other services can be woken, it'll lock the waiters_pid
file, create the service PID file, kill SIGUSR1 all pid and free the lock an
destroy the waiters_pid file.....
no process are running/polling appart the current starting service, none of
the waiters are consuming ressources....



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A requ B C D E
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; B req C
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; F req E
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A &amp; B &amp; C &amp; D &amp; E &amp; F &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A wait on B
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; B wait on C
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; C =&gt; free to run!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; D =&gt; free to run!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; E =&gt; free to run!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; F wait on E
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; D free the lock...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; E free the lock
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; F =&gt; free to run!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; C free the lock...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; B =&gt; free to run!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; B free the lock
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A =&gt; free to run!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; execution order C D E F B A
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; C service if failing? D E F services will be executed, B and A who
</I>&gt;<i> depends
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on it won't.... this is safety!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is both slow and resource intensive.
</I>&gt;<i> Years ago I had a sorcery that was like that.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of cast queues a spell would start to cast
</I>&gt;<i> in it's own process within a screen session
</I>&gt;<i> and it would constantly pole and wait for it's turn to go.
</I>&gt;<i> If 300 spells were waiting to cast
</I>&gt;<i> then that could be 300+ processes waking up periodically
</I>&gt;<i> and polling to see if their turn to run has come.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm merly certain that I can write something based on signals that won't
require much polling time...


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rewriting sorcery was difficult and Evert constantly
</I>&gt;<i> encouraged me to find and fix all the places where
</I>&gt;<i> cast would cease to run while spells remained in the cast queue.
</I>&gt;<i> Those situations were called &quot;stalls.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>in my case there can't be stalls since all service have a timeout..... if
one service fails, all the waiters will fails gracefully on timeout....


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using numbers to control the execution order of init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> is way better than having 100 init-scripts
</I>&gt;<i> doing battle with each other for the use of the CPU
</I>&gt;<i> while trying to figure out what should execute next.
</I>&gt;<i> And exactly how often should each init-script check?
</I>&gt;<i> Check too often and the CPU is hogged.
</I>&gt;<i> Check too infrequent and the CPU is idle.
</I>&gt;<i> Neither is good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having init-scripts run by number is better
</I>&gt;<i> because as soon as an init-script is ready to execute
</I>&gt;<i> then the init-script can execute.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
not sure : counter example :
S01fastService1
S01fastService2
S01HUGELongStartService
S02fastService3

fastService3 only rely on fastService1...... but fastService3 is run after
HUGELongStartService.... CQFD (in french what has to be demonstrated)



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as you see I don't even have to care about numbers..... it runs as fast
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible! even the sorcery parallel boot won't achieve such speed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer's parallel boot blows away the method
</I>&gt;<i> you described by a measure of many seconds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>ready to bet?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, Sorcerer's sysinit is non parallel.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore it is mostly single core
</I>&gt;<i> and gains only a slight benefit from SMP boxes.
</I>&gt;<i> However, a parallel sysinit would be undesirable.
</I>&gt;<i> It might save 3 seconds,
</I>&gt;<i> but cause chaos if anything
</I>&gt;<i> went wrong or out of order.
</I>&gt;<i> And seriously, while fscking filesystems
</I>&gt;<i> no other init-scripts should be executing concurrently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>if none of the init-scripts concurrently running are modifying/mounting the
fscked filesystem then I don't see why.....


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What happens during runlevel start is not as critical as sysinit.
</I>&gt;<i> Ordering is also not nearly as important.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, more concurrent execution of init-scripts is possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wish to demosntrate this in a way that makes sense.
</I>&gt;<i> Do ls /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/
</I>&gt;<i> How high do the numbers go?
</I>&gt;<i> S17?
</I>&gt;<i> Now check the S numbers for /etc/rc.d/rc4.d/
</I>&gt;<i> How high do the S numbers go?
</I>&gt;<i> S04?
</I>&gt;<i> S04 indicates that there are 4 steps.
</I>&gt;<i> All the init-scripts within a step can execute concurrently.
</I>&gt;<i> When they have all finished running
</I>&gt;<i> then all the init-scripts of the next step can begin executing
</I>&gt;<i> concurrently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # for ((CX=0;CX&lt;5;CX++)); do echo -n &quot;S0$CX: &quot;; ls
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/rc.d/rc4.d/S0$CX* | wc -l; done
</I>&gt;<i> S00: 15
</I>&gt;<i> S01: 14
</I>&gt;<i> S02: 10
</I>&gt;<i> S03: 5
</I>&gt;<i> S04: 3
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 15 init-scripts run concurrently at S00,
</I>&gt;<i> 14 at S01,
</I>&gt;<i> 10 at S02,
</I>&gt;<i> 5 at S03,
</I>&gt;<i> and 3 at S04.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> runlevel execution offers good opportunity
</I>&gt;<i> for parallelism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # for ((CX=0;CX&lt;10;CX++)); do echo -n &quot;S0$CX: &quot;; ls
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S0$CX* | wc -l; done
</I>&gt;<i> S00: 3
</I>&gt;<i> S01: 7
</I>&gt;<i> S02: 2
</I>&gt;<i> S03: 1
</I>&gt;<i> S04: 3
</I>&gt;<i> S05: 1
</I>&gt;<i> S06: 5
</I>&gt;<i> S07: 4
</I>&gt;<i> S08: 2
</I>&gt;<i> S09: 2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>no need to prove me that... I'm already aware of that.... only rcS script
have to be really careful on dependency listing...

I'm out of time... will read this during the vacation
