&gt;<i> Good work on the Sorcerer updates.

Thanks.


&gt;<i> Am I right in assuming that the Sorcerer I/R's without xorg will also be a
</I>&gt;<i> smaller download than the current ones?
</I>
Not yet certain how much smaller.
But I am also removing some rarely used
wide loads such as samba and nfs.
Seriously, any SA can just scp over
any files needed without using NFS and/or samba.


&gt;<i> In that case, I might be tempted to wait a while till they are out.
</I>
I never did make the time to cook something up using gtk+
for a GUI type install experience.
I was thinking that with xine and X installed
there could even be instructional videos.
But I suppose that will not be.

&gt;<i> I am extremely limited on the download bandwidth that I can use at work.
</I>
I am using 64M sliding window xz's LZMA implementation
to compress the archives.
It could not be much smaller.
Nearly half the load is probably the initramfs
which is merely gzip compressed.
The kernel might be able to support a LZMA
compressed initramfs, but I do not like it,
because LZMA lacks a magic.
If the kernel starts supporting xz compressed
initramfs then I would do that as long as all
the kernels available can handle it.
For now I know they can all handle gzip compressed.

&gt;<i> Thanks for the info. I might even try going from linux-custom to linux
</I>&gt;<i> again...
</I>
Aside from having nice small stripped modules
sometimes modules that look unnecessary
can be unloaded.
Just because it is fat on disk
does not make it fat in RAM.
The amount of RAM consumed by the kernel
is somewhat in proportion to the total RAM.
However, on many boxes kernel consumption,
caching and buffers not counted,
can be under 30M
It is not like the old days when running
linux on a 16M box was possible.
But also it is not unreasonable.

Nearly, the only way I could provide a linux kernel
that is not modular yet can boot most boxes
is to include all the SCSI SATA PATA EIDE
and filesystem drivers into the kernel.
And there was a time when that could work
if I carefully weeded out the buggy SCSI drivers
that caused kernel crashes during booting.
However, now that makes for a kernel that
is too large to boot.
Creating a monolithic generic rescue kernel
would be difficult with a modern linux kernel.
It was possible at a time when a generic EIDE
driver was available that could work without
chipset specific drivers.
But now there is possibly plenty of hardware
which requires drivers for the chipset.
When it comes to graphics, audio, and disks
there is not as much standardization.
VGA and SVGA to some extend,
AC97 audio to some extent,
and generic BIOS driven EIDE on some boxes.

One thing that does seem to work good is removable
SCSI mass storage on digital cameras.
So far I have owned 3 cameras with that
and I have not required gphoto2 to download pictures.
I just plug in the camera and mount the SCSI drive.


&gt;<i> But I need to have a list of things that need to be installed, scripts in
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/init.d that need to be run in order to have a valid initram
</I>
(
find /etc/init.d -maxdepth 1 -type f
find /root/.sorcery/grimoire/*.d/init.d.on/ -maxdepth 1 \
-type f -printf &quot;/etc/init.d/%f\n&quot;
) | sort | uniq -d | xargs chmod 700

That should turn on the init-scripts that must be on,
unless you removed them from /etc/init.d/


&gt;<i> My last one loaded the kernel, but then could not mount the root filesystem rw.
</I>
That does seem strange.
Even if the init-scripts were not needed
I wonder why you turned them off?
I wonder if there could be bugs in the init-scripts
that are causing the problem?
They work okay for me,
but years have past since I transitioned a box
from a monolithic kernel to a modular one.

Also please check that initramfs and init-scripts are installed.
