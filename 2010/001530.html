<PRE>Yes it is a fun thing.
Some programs write directly to console
and others use an absurd loglevel.
As for those that write to the kernel log
I can set the loglevel to a point where nothing
would be displayed on console.
But that would also hide very important error messages
that a SA should become immediately aware of.

Now there is yet another solution.
That error message seen obfuscating the login
is actually due to something odd that Sorcerer is doing.
Sorcerer makes available all of the gettys even before
the first runlevel init-script executes.
This has several effects.
First, a hang during runlevel startup will not
prevent someone from being able to login at a virtual console.
Second, getty login is made available faster than usual.
Third, annoying programs that print to /dev/console
or the kernel log with an absurd loglevel will write
to the screen causing scroll and possibly obscuring
the welcome and login prompt.

So the other solution is obviously....
Do not activate getty logins until after
the runlevel has completed which is probably
what most other POSIX do.
However, that would make a hang or even
a long delay during runlevel startup very annoying!

So that is why Sorcerer boxes risk a slightly
messy welcome/login prompt in order to
ensure that a login prompt definitely appears.
Depending on how many services start during
runlevel and the speed of the fixed disk
and whether errors occur and other factors
the time to complete the runlevel might vary
between 1 second and over a minute.
For most modern boxes the delay is minimal.
However, just in case a bad init-script or service
could potentially hang the runlevel startup
I decided that starting the gettys first
was the lesser of two evils.

Like with many implementations there might not
necessarily be a right or wrong way to do it.
However, given the customizability of Sorcerer
some SAs will eventually write an init-script
that hangs the runlevel startup.
At least with this method of implementation
the worst case scenario is not as bad as it could be
since the SA can log in and view the runlevel log to
find out how far the runlevel progressed.
Definitely, we risk sacrificing a good appearance
for avoiding the situation where a SA is unable to
login to the box to fix an unanticipated error during boot.

Of course like any aspect about Sorcerer
it is open to debate as long as someone will
provide both lists of boons and banes to discuss.
