That might be something strange having to do with gdm.
Perhaps after a user logs out gdm quits
then restarts with a new PID?


&gt;<i> 2) the process might have spawned a child and exited (ie the main executable

</I>&gt;<i> 3) a service that has crashed but spawned childs (who are then now attached

&gt;<i> I've no solution to propose,

We could quit using a PID file for gdm
and instead query the PID as needed.
That method is only good as long as processes
called gdm are really the gdm we expect.

&gt;<i> but is there a way to kill all a tree? ie kill the process and all it's
</I>&gt;<i> childs?
</I>
Yes.
However, I would not normally do that,
especially if the parent PID is already dead.
Instead I tend to use pkill.
Given a command such as
# pkill -u root &quot;^gdm$&quot;
That would precisely kill processes that are called exactly gdm.

&gt;<i> is there a way to assign a group id or something like that that remains for
</I>&gt;<i> all childs of the process? if yes we could set it, and then kill all the
</I>&gt;<i> process of the group....
</I>
Yes, but startup would be somewhat more complex.
Something would have to run before gdm
to switch the group to a non root group such as gdm.
And of course a gdm group must exist.
And if a gdm group exists then so should a user gdm
just to keep the numbers lined up.
Yet gdm could not run as user gdm,
because after someone logs in it must switch
to the user that logged in.

Hmm, gdm is rather strange for a daemon.
It does not background itself.
Overall it is almost like a full gnome session
when it runs instead of merely a login manager.
And it does have it's own user and group.
killing /usr/sbin/gdm-binary
seems to bring it down okay or not
since it did not return to console.

The gdm-restart shell script is funny.
It check for a PID file and errors 1 if it is not found.
And if a PID file is found it writes &quot;Not supported&quot;
and does not restart gdm.
*lol*

Perhaps the gdm authors are aware that gdm
is not a daemon that behaves appropriately?
Although gdm does not background itself
it does write it's own PID file.
If it's PID file is incorrect
then that would be because of a bug with gdm.

The /usr/sbin/gdm-stop provided with gdm
basically kills off the the PID specified in gdm's PID file.

Hmm...
And of course there are your observations
about the remaining child PIDs of gdm
that fortunately have the UID of gdm.

I can avoid this problem
that is to say make the init-script incorrect
and have it kill gdm-binary and every processes
owned by gdm and X.
But that is a bit messy.
Hmm, gdm is a bit tricky to kill off.
And using kill -9 does leave that
gdm-simple-slave alive.

How do you want to stop and restart gdm?
&gt;<i>From the look of it gdm is not intended
</I>to be stopped or restarted.
It does not behave like a normal daemon.
My guess is that it is intended to be started
directly by init at runlevel 5 as if gdm were a getty.
But that would not be possible on Sorcerer.

The docs differ a bit from the actual scripts.
For example part of the docs for gdm states

&quot;          &lt;command&gt;gdm-restart&lt;/command&gt; stops and restarts GDM by sending
          the GDM daemon a HUP signal.  This command will immediately terminate
          all sessions and log out users currently logged in with GDM.
&quot;

Actually, the script does not do that.
Nor does the gdm-safe-restart

&quot;          &lt;command&gt;gdm-stop&lt;/command&gt; stops GDM by sending the GDM daemon
          a TERM signal.&quot;

According to the docs
the Sorcerer init-script is doing the correct action
by trying to send TERM to the PID specified in gdm's PID file.

I was reading gdm-2.30.2/docs/C/gdm.xml
After a quick glance I did not notice anything
about gdm's configuration on Sorcerer that is
incorrect or faulty.

My best guess is that current gdm is buggy or incomplete.
If the Sorcerer's gdm init-script invoked gdm-stop
the result would be the same.
I guess that sometimes gdm must be manually stopped
by the SA by selectively killing associated processes.

While not a command I normally use
see the pstree command for a way to show
all spawned children processes.

I am open to suggestions for what you want to do with gdm.
