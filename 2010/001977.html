<PRE>&gt;<i> Normally, a SA wants to expect

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I want to give that more consideration

</I>
I definitely agree that it's desirable to keep the safety built in. I
have just taken the default options many times on many spells.
What I am proposing is that whenever I am bored or hit a spell that is
particularly difficult to figure out, I might clean it up and send it
in for approval by you.

ie:

$RANDOM_SPELL config:
[ ] without $GOOD_OPTION1
[ ] without $GOOD_OPTION2
[ ] with      $BAD_OPTION1

and so on... This way the options that are safe are always empty,
unless the SA has explicitly turned something on or off.
Troubleshooting why a spell does not work might also be easier like
this. What would be nice, though, is a way to see what the current
config for a spell is from augur. And I do still long for the days
where I could reconfigure a spell without issuing augur forget. It's
too big of a hammer for some of the surgical configs I want to do.

Two spells that instantly jump to mind are ffmpeg and net-tools.. it
took me a while to enable ping to be built on my box. :P
