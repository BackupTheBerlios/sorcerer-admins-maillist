You still do, although the staff of Freenode is small, vlunteer, adn
overburdened so it may be some time before there's a response.


&gt;<i> I forgot how IRC works  :)

LOL

&gt;<i> Having someone who is a fair and knowledgeable representative of Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> on the IRC channel would be nice, but
</I>&gt;<i> as we all know in most IRC channels with hundreds of people logged in
</I>&gt;<i> none of them are awake and listening.
</I>&gt;<i> *lol*
</I>

Yes I've been to those planets ;)

&gt;<i> With Sorcerer's IRC channel the truth is more obvious
</I>&gt;<i> since nobody is logged in.
</I>
Pekka's there, and I'm there now whenever I'm online.

Here's the particulars I posted to Grimdin (Pekka) in the channel:
<A HREF="http://freenode.net/group_registration.shtml">http://freenode.net/group_registration.shtml</A>

Basically, you're the owner of the group, which includes the #sorcerer
channel, but I don't know of the specific controls they talk about in
the page above, or what you need to do to add ChanOPs or even change the
topic to get rid of the old, obsolete *wox.org* URLs that really do need
to be changed.

I'll pledge to remain in the channel whenever I'm online, but then
again, as you inferred above, it may be like many other channels where
the lights are on but nobody's home - or seemingly not listening.

Freenode is the best network, IMO, for support forums, while Dalnet is
fading and EFnet is a rather scary place. Most decent channels
supporting projects are on Freenode.

Most script kiddies are on EFnet.

Regardless, it's good to know all is well :)

</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, not 100% is working, then again it never is.
</I>&gt;<i> That is not so bad because problems are often caused by
</I>&gt;<i> software authors, libtool, and other non Sorcerer/sorcery related factors.
</I>&gt;<i> The goal is 95% usability.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually we meet that.
</I>&gt;<i> If not then it is because the are some &quot;forever broke&quot; spells
</I>&gt;<i> in the grimoire which I have not removed.
</I>&gt;<i> By &quot;forever broke&quot; it means that it is broke
</I>&gt;<i> and the software author has discontinued making releases for it.
</I>&gt;<i> Some things surprise me.
</I>&gt;<i> I was expecting that aviation was forever broke at version 0.1,
</I>&gt;<i> but then the software author made a 0.2 release.
</I>&gt;<i> It compiles and installs, but is still unusable.
</I>&gt;<i> *lol*  Maybe that qualifies version 0.2 as broke also.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The fixing broke spells has a low priority.
</I>&gt;<i> Next attempts are usually made when time is available
</I>&gt;<i> or when the software author makes new releases.
</I>&gt;<i> Removing broke spells tends to happen after the software's website becomes
</I>&gt;<i> unreachable or owned by a DNS squatter.
</I>&gt;<i> Feel free to try to fix the changes and submit the fixes into the grimoire
</I>&gt;<i> for spells that have the broke attribute.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for the quiet...
</I>&gt;<i> Many people are doing the year end rush
</I>&gt;<i> to try to complete tasks which either should not
</I>&gt;<i> or can not linger into 2011.
</I>&gt;<i> The end of the year can be stressful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For those with a few minutes to play
</I>&gt;<i> there are some December Install/Rescue images
</I>&gt;<i> that I uploaded near the beginning of the month.
</I>&gt;<i> They passed testing.
</I>&gt;<i> So they will probably work.
