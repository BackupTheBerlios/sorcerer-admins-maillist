</I>
My thought about /etc/init.d/networks
is that /etc/init.d/networks more or less fits the archetype of an init-script.
It runs a start program and a stop program.
/etc/networks.d/ is not considered part of the /etc/init.d/networks init-script
It is run as a separate program rather than sourced in.
That seems like a different issue and different discussion.


&gt;<i> mount has it's config file as /etc/fstab, so the idea is not so very new.
</I>
If setting up a network was more like mounting a file system,
more like defining a file system device and and mount point association,
and more like defining a swap file or swap device
then I could understand having an /etc/nettab
The important aspect about /etc/fstab
that makes it different from
a configuration file for an init-script
is that /etc/fstab is used directly by programs such as:

/sbin/mount
/sbin/umount
/sbin/swapon
/sbin/swapoff

With a few exceptions
/etc/fstab is a configuration file for a program
invoked by an init-script,
but it is not normally a configuration file for an init-script.

If /etc/fstab was a file sourced in or read in by an init-script
and used as parameters for starting an additional program
then that would be more what I expect from a configuration
file for an init-script.

Therefore, my idea of a configuration file for an init-script
is a file that contains information that is used directly by
the init-script and perhaps handed as command line parameters
to the programs an init-script runs.
However, a configuration file for an init-script would not be like
/etc/networks.d/ nor like /etc/fstab.
/etc/networks.d/ is more like it's own program.
/etc/fstab are configuration files most often used
directly by programs run by init-scripts.
However, at times even those lines blur.

I am not saying that /etc/init.d/conf.d/networks
would be un-doable for the /etc/init.d/networks init-script.
However, I have no idea how /etc/init.d/conf.d/networks
could become a replacement for /etc/networks.d/


&gt;<i> modules also have a config file...
</I>
The files in /etc/modprobe.d/
such as /etc/modprobe.d/i915.conf
Those can contain configuration information for modules.


&gt;<i> most services that start have a config file,
</I>
Do they?
I would not normally consider a config file for a program run by an init-script
to necessarily be the same as a config file for an init-script.
Therefore, my perspective is that an init-scripts will rarely have a
config file.


&gt;<i> Maybe some launch feedback, as is done now.
</I>&gt;<i> The init could call the script, and stick something about that in the
</I>&gt;<i> log, and the program could then say fail, launched, success or
</I>&gt;<i> whatever would be most fitting....
</I>i&gt; So, the log file could look very much similar to what we have today,
&gt;<i> maybe even shorter...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ie:
</I>&gt;<i> calling: /etc/init.d/mount &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [success]
</I>&gt;<i> calling: /etc/init.d/networks &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [fail &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;]
</I>&gt;<i> calling: /etc/init.d/bootmisc
</I>&gt;<i> calling: /etc/init.d/kdm-5 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;[launched]
</I>

Code to provide that additional information can be added to
/etc/init.d/prc
It would make the logs somewhat longer.
But it would help make evident the location of a problem
provided that init-scripts are running in series.
Instead of having to grep some text from init-scripts in /etc/init.d/
The log would show exactly what init-script was ran.

 * loopback configuring                                         [ warning ]
 * loopback configured                                          [ success ]

Seeing that alone does not indicate that the
information was printed during the execution of
/etc/init.d/loopback

Lines such as:
 * Run /etc/init.d/loopback
 * loopback configuring                                         [ warning ]
 * loopback configured                                          [ success ]
 * Ran /etc/init.d/loopback

Or perhaps printing
/etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S00loopback
would show more precisely
what is running and where a problem
might be happening if init-scripts are
being run in sequence.


&gt;<i> It would look cool, but I have no idea whether this might actually be feasible.
</I>&gt;<i> I might hack it a little, and see just how badly I can break the init
</I>&gt;<i> on my boxes. Luckily, just casting init-scripts can bring that back to
</I>&gt;<i> normal.. :)
</I>

I did not have such information print
because it will make information during sysinit
and runlevel scroll faster and longer.
And the additional information is only useful
during serial execution of init-scripts.
However, it does make sense to have it.

When I go looking for a problem
I look for the problematic init-script
by grepping for text from log scroll
in files located in /etc/init.d/
to see which init-script can print it.
That lacks a certain eloquence and convenience.
