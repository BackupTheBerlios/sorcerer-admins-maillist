<PRE>new Install/Rescue images can be downloaded.
The best reason to download and burn a new CD
is avoid problems with bugs in LVM2.

Thanks to some conversation with Evert Vorster;
installation can be even easier or more complex
depending upon the SA's preference.
The first selection on the main menu is the skill mode.
Novice skill provides just enough in order to accomplish
disk partitioning, creating file systems, and installation.
I hope that before 2011 I will have a chance to see
if my mother can manage to install Sorcerer using novice menus.
That would achieve a new level of Sorcerer novice SA friendliness
that would be beyond my expectations.

In contrast to the novice skill mode is the expert skill mode.
That is definitely the mode for SAs that want
MDRAID, LVM2, LUKS encryption or any combination of
one, more, or all of the above choices.

Also as an alternative to creating separate MDRAIDs
or slicing and dicing a MDRAID with LVM2
a MDRAID can now be partitioned like a disk; yes with fdisk.
That way a SA could elect for a RAID-5 for redundancy protection
of data across 3 or more fixed disks while at the same time
enjoying the simplicity of being able to partition the end result.

Thanks to Evert voicing his interest in BTRFS,
I added initial support for installing Sorcerer onto BTRFS.
BTRFS is still an experimental file system.
It's on disk format is changing.
Therefore, the question is not what to do if BTRFS breaks,
but what to do when BTRFS breaks.
So, please no BTRFS on production boxes
and make backups of files stored on BTRFS,
and yes make separate backups and not a COW on the BTRFS.

BTRFS is rather odd when compared to other file systems.
First, sub volumes can be created on BTRFS.
That is a bit like logical volumes with LVM2,
except that a BTRFS sub volume will not
require file system initialization.
Also a COW, copy on write, sub-volume can be created on BTRFS.
Although I have not made time to thoroughly play with BTRFS,
I read bits and pieces while using google to gather information
that suggest that some SAs have high hopes for the future of BTRFS
and that some expect that BTRFS might even dethrone ext
as the default file system.
We shall see.
And if it happens the Sorcerer menu driven installer
is nearly ready for the transition as is.

However, currently, installations involving some types of MDRAIDs,
any type of LVM2, XFS or BTRFS should also have a dedicated
/boot partition of file system type ext2 size 2G.
XFS lacks a dedicated boot block.
I do not know if LILO can locate kernels and initramfs on XFS.
LVM2 logical volumes might have a dedicated boot block,
depending upon the file system installed,
yet since a logical volume since it is not a partition
a boot-able MBR would not be able to chain to and load
a lilo in the boot block of a file system on a LVM2 logical volume.
I do not know if lilo can locate kernels and initramfs
on a familiar file system when installed on a logical volume
rather than a partition.

Although installation of lilo into the MBR is possible
I am not supporting it.
Having lilo installed in the MBR
might enable the use of some installation types
without a dedicated /boot block.
I am not testing this.
Therefore, when using a combination that is not tested
be sure to test it and expect that it might fail.
Most combinations that are guaranteed to work
will have a dedicated /boot ext2 partition of size 2G.
Rather than complain
please accept it as a tiny investment in the probability of success.

If a SAs feels confused or uncertain about what to do or what can be done
then selecting the skill menu presents not only a choice to select skill mode,
but that choice is also followed by useful information that is easy to forget.
Or should I say easily forgotten useful information?
Although this does not fully accomplish
my initial intention to add help screens
to almost every menu
this addition should still be useful
in helping SAs decide what to do.

When available RAM during installation permits
a few extra archives will be extracted to the initramfs.
And also some menus will offer the SA
the opportunity to read a manual page before proceeding.
It might be useful.

I tested nearly every combination of of installation
that I expected should demonstrate problems
if bugs exist in the menu driven installer.
After about a half dozen tests or more
I started tracking them in my todo list to avoid repeating tests.

Part -&gt;         LUKS         -&gt; FS
Part -&gt;         LVM2         -&gt; FS
Part -&gt;         LVM2 -&gt; LUKS -&gt; FS
Part -&gt; RAID -&gt;                 FS
Part -&gt; RAID -&gt; LVM2 -&gt; LUKS -&gt; FS
Part -&gt; RAID -&gt; Part -&gt; LUKS -&gt; FS

Partitions are simple for installation.
Software RAIDs could be very useful.
LVM2 is mostly a matter of SA preference,
for SAs that would prefer not to do partitions.
And LUKS encryption is essential
when encryption of file systems or swaps is desired.

UUIDs are used for addressing file systems,
except when LUKS encrypted.
Device names are used to address swaps
and LUKS encrypted file systems and
LUKS encrypted swaps.
Hopefully this does not cause inconvenience.

Last and definitely not least
we again have Pekka Panula to thank
for the awesome bandwidth and virtual
hosting provided for Sorcerer.
Due to this awesome hosting
we enjoy fast downloading with
and no waiting and competing for
anonymous login slots on a ftp server.
