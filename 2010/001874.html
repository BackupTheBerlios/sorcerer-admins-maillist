An example of that would be
when networking is set up on a wireless interface
that has a propensity to disconnect.


&gt;<i> what I was proposing is to not rely on the service that might die, have
</I>&gt;<i> different bugs from each others, but an service manager, that will be common
</I>&gt;<i> and then share the same issues (then easier to fix)
</I>&gt;<i> such process have to :
</I>&gt;<i> - not consume any resources in normal operation (appart a little bit of
</I>&gt;<i> memory) ie not access the FS, not use the CPU, unless asked for it
</I>&gt;<i> - use mechanism not involving &quot;slow&quot; devices such as hard drives....
</I>
And such a service manager would know
how to check if networks is still up
given how the type and amount of network
interfaces on a box varies?

The concept of writing a monitor program is not new in Sorcerer.
It was called the Sorcerer immune system.
All sorts of things can be monitored provided
that it is hand coded.
Unfortunately, the idea of a single program that monitors
anything and everything that could be wanted
is doomed to fail from the start.

&gt;<i> not consume any resources is achieved by the use of SIGNALS, the process
</I>&gt;<i> mainly sleep, waiting for a signal to occurs, this signal can be for
</I>&gt;<i> signaling that a child has died (SIGCHLD), that a communication service has
</I>&gt;<i> some request to do (SIGIO)
</I>
Yup, that is the Sorcerer immune system.
By loading the BASH preloadable /usr/libexec/bash/sleep
the monitoring process can sleep at will
without wasting resources to invoke /usr/bin/sleep


&gt;<i> fast communication between process is achieved by the use of unix sockets, a
</I>&gt;<i> small protocol has to be implemented like
</I>&gt;<i> &lt; REGISTER PID
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> REGISTER OK
</I>&gt;<i> &lt; STOP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> STOP OK
</I>&gt;<i> &lt; STATUS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm running and my childes are also
</I>

PIDs?  Again?
If a process needs nanny sitting and has a PID
then /sbin/init does this.
search for respawn in the manual page for inittab

echo $$ &gt; /var/run/$PIDFILE
is a plenty fast enough way to write a PID
that requires no sockets, no listening daemon,
and is already supported by the majority
of software that writes PID files.


&gt;<i> each service begin by reading a configuration file saying what initscript
</I>&gt;<i> provide what service, what it requires and other informations gathered into
</I>&gt;<i> the init script itself, that file can be created when doing the rc
</I>&gt;<i> symlinks.....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> then after that on a startup a service wrapper do
</I>&gt;<i> 1) open or create the unix socket
</I>&gt;<i> 2) start the child service in it's group idea
</I>&gt;<i> 3) wait for an event (either child exit or opening socket or communication
</I>&gt;<i> on the socket)
</I>&gt;<i> 4) do the cleanup on exit (kill the group ID)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> overhead? a socket opening.... communication through a socket (almost
</I>&gt;<i> instant, only involve kernel)
</I>&gt;<i> no lock file, no PID file.... a reliable communication between services (if
</I>&gt;<i> a service exit, the communication channel will close and the clients will be
</I>&gt;<i> notified....)
</I>&gt;<i> JL
</I>
And what is done about all the services
that write their PIDs to /var/run/$PIDF ?
Will you start them
then wait for an indeterminate amount of time
for the pid file to appear
to cat the content of the pid file to a socket?

Evert,
do you still have that hyperlink to the SysV init replacement
that uses the automounter and socket buffer?
I know there is already a project that does what JeanLuc wants.

Doing a web search I found:
<A HREF="http://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/cinit/">http://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/cinit/</A>
But that is not the one that uses the automounter
and socket buffers, yes?
It has some links to other inits at the bottom.
<A HREF="http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/systemd.html">http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/systemd.html</A>
Ah, that is the URL I want JeanLuc to have an opportunity to read.

The idea is that it starts about 5 services before everything
such as whatever is required for an automounter
a socket buffer and other stuff.
Then the expectation is that ever other service
can be started in parallel.
Looks awesome, except, there is no way
to hop across the transition from the initramfs rootfs
to a real root filesystem.
Also the re-execution of coldplug events for udevd
is not something that should be done in parallel.

Attempts at creating perfect parallelizing init-script
executions always have drawbacks.
They have exceptions that can not be run in parallel.
They can not cross over a divide such as the
transition between initramfs to real rootfs.
They are incredibly complicated and require
that the person maintaining the init system have
extensive knowledge about the services started
to include what they require started,
the sockets they use and create,
and what else will try to communicate with them, etc...

34 lines to achieve a good amount of parallelization
during runlevel init-script execution is not a bad compromise
between simplicity and speed.
And I barely have to know anything about the services
that a box in order to create init-scripts.
I only must know what must be run before.

Creating a more complicated init is easy.
Creating a better init is difficult.
I knew that much back when there was a discussion
about how to improve Sorcerer init-scripts.
That discussion lasted a year before deciding
to stay with System V and implement a
LSB compatible method to control order of execution.

The discussion about how to improve init-scripts
lasted at least a year before any implementation was created.
And even then the transition was not easy and would
have been much bumpier without Jan helping to spot
and fix problems with init-scripts.

Discussion about what would be a better method for
execution of init-scripts should at least have a duration
of a year so that we can avoid regret.
Such a change probably ultimately requires the modification
and testing of hundreds of init-scripts.
That requires considerable effort.
Would be very regretful to introduce a system for
running init-scripts that is too complicated to understand
when something undesirable happens.

I do not understand why complexity and control
is favored over simplicity and robustness.
Complexity and control of init-script execution
can be increased without a gain of even a
0.0001% better probability of a successful boot
when something unexpected happens.

Increasing the probability of a successful boot
even when undesirable events happen
can be achieved by the improvement of init-scripts.
Robustness is achieved not by increasing
the complexity and control of the system that
is used to execute init-scripts.
Robustness is achieved by writing better init-scripts.
