<PRE>Thanks for that.
There are a number of strange things
that Sorcerer boxes do that depart from
the expected way to do them
For example:
First, log files that are created during boot are stored
in /etc/init.d/log.d/
Yes that is not in /var/log/
Why?
Because /var/log/ would not exist on an initramfs
and /etc/init.d/log.d/ would exist
After the real root filesystem is mounted
the tmpfs mounted at /etc/init.d/log.d/
is simply moved to the /etc/init.d/log.d/
on the real / partition.
That does not require a copy or a write of those
files to the real / filesystem and thus saves on unnecessary
disk wear and tear.

Second, Sorcerer boxes have an /etc.ori/
What is /etc.ori/  ?
It contains nearly the same files are are stored in /etc/
But the files in /etc.ori/ remain unmodified from the files
originally installed by the spell or source.
In that fashion a SA can more easily uncustomize
a configuration file since a backup of the original
is already available in /etc.ori/
Also /etc.ori/ barely uses any space.

Not in any documentations or specifications
have I seen written anything about providing
an /etc.ori/ nor anything like it.
However, in the past SAs did complain about
either not being able to easily uncustomize configuration files
or being able to easily know the exactly what the difference
is between the customized and uncustomized versions.
However, now with /etc.ori/ all those problems are easily
surmountable.
And since /etc.ori/ is right there in /
the SA is certain to notice that it exists.

My point is that Sorcerer is not necessarily constructed in a way
that strictly conforms to specifications, but rather allows
some departure from the norm based upon what SAs
say that they want or require.

Sorcerer, for example can run LSB compliant init-scripts.
However, most Sorcerer init-scripts are not LSB compliant
although they start with typical LSB init-script comment section.
Sorcerer init-scripts are made to be smaller, faster
have less potential for bugs as compared to
strictly LSB compliant init-scripts.

By providing such conveniences Sorcerer
yields a bit more control over to the SA
than it would compared to a source based distro
that does not deviate from specifications
in order to better meet SA requirements.
However, even with that there are still many aspects
that are determined at the distribution level are not
easily customizable by SAs.

For example, init-scripts are critical importance.
They exist in /etc/init.d/ and therefore are
stored under /etc/ which is a location
that is normally used for configuration files.
However, /etc/init.d/ are not treated as configuration files
and therefore they are not allowed to be customized.
Modifications to spell owned files in /etc/init.d/
are lost when the spell is updated.
However, a SA could elect to create a different spell
that provides the original spell and also installs what
the SA requires for init-scripts.
And that new spell can be stored in the local grimoire.
This extra effort is required so that SA do not
accidentally mess up a box by modifying files in
/etc/init.d/ that aught not be modified or would
disappear or change in their role upon an update.

A good example of semi-volatile init-scripts
are those which are installed by the init-script spell.
Those are init-scripts which would be required
on all Sorcerer boxes.
However, unlike pre-compiled binary based distros
that might install init-scripts for software which is not installed,
Sorcerer boxes tend to only install init-scripts for the software
which is installed.

SAs can still disable init-scripts from automatic execution
by giving the init-script a mode of 0600 instead of 0700

So in summary, yes some weird things happen in Sorcerer,
but they are due to what SAs have requested in the past.
And overall the changes tend to provide
a greater boon than bane.
But the way some things are done in Sorcerer
might be entirely different from every other distribution.
Yet usually that is not a bad thing.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes it is a fun thing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some programs write directly to console
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and others use an absurd loglevel.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for those that write to the kernel log
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can set the loglevel to a point where nothing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be displayed on console.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But that would also hide very important error messages
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that a SA should become immediately aware of.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now there is yet another solution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That error message seen obfuscating the login
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is actually due to something odd that Sorcerer is doing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorcerer makes available all of the gettys even before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the first runlevel init-script executes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This has several effects.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First, a hang during runlevel startup will not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prevent someone from being able to login at a virtual console.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Second, getty login is made available faster than usual.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Third, annoying programs that print to /dev/console
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or the kernel log with an absurd loglevel will write
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the screen causing scroll and possibly obscuring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the welcome and login prompt.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So the other solution is obviously....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do not activate getty logins until after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the runlevel has completed which is probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what most other POSIX do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, that would make a hang or even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a long delay during runlevel startup very annoying!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So that is why Sorcerer boxes risk a slightly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messy welcome/login prompt in order to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ensure that a login prompt definitely appears.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Depending on how many services start during
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> runlevel and the speed of the fixed disk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and whether errors occur and other factors
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the time to complete the runlevel might vary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between 1 second and over a minute.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For most modern boxes the delay is minimal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, just in case a bad init-script or service
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could potentially hang the runlevel startup
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I decided that starting the gettys first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was the lesser of two evils.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Like with many implementations there might not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessarily be a right or wrong way to do it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, given the customizability of Sorcerer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some SAs will eventually write an init-script
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that hangs the runlevel startup.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At least with this method of implementation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the worst case scenario is not as bad as it could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since the SA can log in and view the runlevel log to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> find out how far the runlevel progressed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Definitely, we risk sacrificing a good appearance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for avoiding the situation where a SA is unable to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> login to the box to fix an unanticipated error during boot.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course like any aspect about Sorcerer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is open to debate as long as someone will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provide both lists of boons and banes to discuss.
