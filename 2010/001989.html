<PRE>&gt;<i> Well, you did say that Sorcerer is running without a
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/config, and I'm just saying that a lot of the things
</I>&gt;<i> called during the init of a system has a config file already.
</I>
Okay, that makes sense.
init-scripts is more about starting services
than providing configuration information.
Almost all services that would be started
expect to find their configuration information
supplied in configuration files.
When parameters are excepted or even expected
is when that parameter would specify a non-default
location for configuration files.
That is more my impression from experience
rather than a statement of fact.


&gt;<i> I don't want those files to be moved, either... &#160;it has taken me long
</I>&gt;<i> enough to learn where they live, and the software authors also expect
</I>&gt;<i> their files in specific places.
</I>
For better or worse the names of directories
and locations of files in /etc/
is a matter of long standing legacy.
Even the trick I did involving lilo's configuration file
still required that symbolic link /etc/lilo.conf
to appease SAs that expect to find an /etc/lilo.conf
For the most part Sorcerer tends not to break the traditions,
but instead it bends them and might do things that are not
explicitly forbidden like providing an /etc.ori/

One of the last big moves on a pan distribution level
was the attempt to make most software that installs multiple header files
to install them within a directory in /usr/include/
instead of installing all the header files directly in /usr/include/
I vaguely recall a bit of a problem with some software
not compiling for expecting that readline's header files
would be installed directly in /usr/include/
Fortunately, something like that was as easily overcome as adding
&quot;-I/usr/include/readline&quot; to CFLAGS

However, overall migration of files tends to cause stress
and sometimes a bit of confusion.
udev authors seemed brave to me when they changed
the definitions for rules so that permissions could
be specified with rules instead of having two types of files.
Then they did something even more shocking by moving
their rules files out of /etc/
I do not dislike where udev has arrived,
but there was stress at several transitions.

However, that trivia probably does not contribute
to the main topic of the conversation.

&gt;<i> So far, it looks like almost all the config files are somewhere in
</I>&gt;<i> /etc. Which is a good thing. I really can't think of a spell that
</I>&gt;<i> would benefit from having a config that does not already have a config
</I>&gt;<i> now.
</I>
I try to force all config files, yes even those for kde,
to be installed in /etc/
Probably I am missing a considerable amount.
The convenience of something like /etc.ori/ and /etc.sav/
sort of depends on a configuration file being in /etc/
and not /opt /usr or some other directory.


&gt;<i> There may be some room for improvement in the init-scripts, but is it
</I>&gt;<i> worth the effort to go scratching around there?
</I>
I changed a few lines in share, a few in cast,
and added 3 to init-functions.
The effort for the support is not immense.
But such changes cause a cumulative performance degrade
and are wasteful if they are not being used.
That is why I am checking my email frequently
to see if anyone has sent me an example
of a custom init-script for httpd or some other service
in order to give a good indication of how the stock spells
should be improved in order that SA can modify a configuration
file for the init-script instead of having to create a custom init-script
to start such services.


&gt;<i> We really should just submit wanted changes to the init-scripts to
</I>&gt;<i> you, together with motivations and working code. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Lines such as:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;* Run /etc/init.d/loopback
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;* loopback configuring &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [ warning ]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;* loopback configured &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;[ success ]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;* Ran /etc/init.d/loopback
</I>

Ah, I already tested that code.
Works fine for sysinit and serial run levels.
I am using cyan for the color of the *

&gt;<i> This is a bit over the top, and not what I was suggesting at all.
</I>
Too bad, because logging the start and end of an init-script
is the only clear way to see if the error message printed
belongs to that init-script.
And in some cases it might not even if it is enclosed.

&gt;<i> In my example, it was expressed in one line, not four, which is half the
</I>&gt;<i> line length of the normal Sorcery init-script log.
</I>&gt;<i> In your example, it would be written to the log as:
</I>&gt;<i> init: /etc/init.d/loopback &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; [success]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first part of the line already says you are calling the script, so
</I>&gt;<i> no need to say [warning]
</I>&gt;<i> The script returns it's status at the end of the line, and then it's
</I>&gt;<i> on to the next init script.
</I>
The warning lines are important.
They indicate that an action is about to happen.
If the warning line prints and the outcome line does not print
then that indicates that actions in between caused a hang,
delay, or some problem.
My understanding of the use of LSB style logging from init-scripts
is that the attempted action should be explained,
executed, and then the outcome revealed.
One line can not properly replace two lines
since the action happens in between the two lines.


&gt;<i> This is good too.
</I>&gt;<i> Now if we only could get the scripts to output their messages into the
</I>&gt;<i> logs as well, that would be fantastic... but that is for another time.
</I>
They do.
All non dialog output from init-scripts is logged.
Programs that are invoked that decide to write
their output directly to console or the kernel buffer
might not be logged.
That is not an init-script.
That is a program being run by an init-script.
If the program outputs on stdout or stderr
then it's output will be logged.

&gt;<i> I dunno.. these are just ideas I wanted to run past you to make
</I>&gt;<i> troubleshooting troublesome init scripts easier.
</I>
I would not have implemented the code
had I not anticipated the outcome.
Boon: trouble shooting init-scripts might be easier.
Bane: logs from sysinit and runlevel execution become larger.
It is nearly an evenly weighed trade-off.

&gt;<i> Well, if we did it this way:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> init: &#160; $INIT_SCRIPT
</I>&gt;<i> $INIT_SCRIPT: $EXIT_STATUS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> we get the benefit that no script can hide by just not printing
</I>&gt;<i> anything to the log.
</I>&gt;<i> The logs will be exactly as long as they would have been if the init
</I>&gt;<i> scripts have all had a line for starting and a line for exit status.
</I>
An important consideration is being neglected.
One must assume that at any time that something
that is happening within an init-script might not return.
It might hang, forever.
Waiting for a return state before printing means
that no warning is given about what is being tried.
Do we want to be debugging a hang scenario
without knowing which init-script was executing
and without knowing what was being tried?
We can not await an outcome before printing.
Before then something terrible might have already happened.



&gt;&gt;<i> That lacks a certain eloquence and convenience.
</I>&gt;<i> Yup, especially when that script is assumed to be so simple that it
</I>&gt;<i> cannot fail, and thus did not print an entry in the first place.
</I>
The thing is that those really simple init-scripts
that would exit without printing anything
is that they do exit because they did nothing that would
not be done in an init-script that does nothing
but starts and quits.
If such simple init-scripts were to fail bad
then that would indicate a problem in /lib/lsb/init-functions
that effects all init-scripts that source in /lib/lsb/init-functions.
So basically, the init-scripts that print nothing and exit are zero threat.

In other words the init-script is like a guy
who accidentally walking into a woman's bathroom.
Better that he immediately turns and departs
without startling anyone by announcing that he is here
and this is not the expected place.


&gt;<i> I could try this on my system first, and see how it goes...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do a lot more rebooting than most, since I run Sorcerer on my
</I>&gt;<i> laptop, so I am more exposed to init-scripts, and I have to say that I
</I>&gt;<i> will be the prime benefactor as well, should we decide to make the
</I>&gt;<i> process more transparent.
</I>
I hope debugging problems involving init is fun.

I do not recommend testing such changes
except on a dedicated test box or virtual machine.
I kept backups of /etc/init.d/prc and /etc/init.d/rcS in /etc/before/
so that if booting was a problem
then I could
rdinit=/bin/bash
# cp /before/* /etc/init.d/
# exec /init

Anyway, I want to re-iterate again
that for what could go wrong,
such as udevtrigger loading module i915.ko
thus causing the screen to blank forever,
a line should be printed before an event happens
rather than awaiting the outcome of the event.
A quick eye could spot that a screen blanked
forever just as udevtrigger began.
However, no eye could spot that correlation
if first the screen blanks forever
and then the line about udevtrigger is printed.

Just like a regular SA I made the kernel config change,
recompiled, installed, rebooted and encountered the problem.
And I debugged it the same way I would any init-script,
maybe the same way that most any SA would probably
try to discover and circumvent a problem during sysinit
on a Sorcerer box.
At first, I restarted the box as usual a few times
just to see that the problem was repeatable and
to have a very good look at exactly what printed
just before the screen blanked.

I had reasons such as that in mind
when I decided about when and how init-scripts
should print messages.
The screen scroll is formidable,
however just maybe the last line printed
will be a good enough clue to direct a SA
to peck at the problem in the correct init-script.

I am hoping that if init-script quality can be sufficiently improved
so that SAs will avoid solutions that require custom init-scripts
then SAs will probably receive less opportunities to
encounter and debug problems involving sysinit and runlevel start.
I prefer Sorcerer init to work without fail.
However, the i915.ko loaded by udevtrigger
causing a forever blank screen situation
is an example of a hardware specific problem
that would not be seen on every box.
That was not a bug in any init-script.
However, the problem was still formidable.
And initially the problem was debugged as if the problem
was a problem with an init-script.
So I was thankful to see exactly what was attempted
just before the screen went blank.
