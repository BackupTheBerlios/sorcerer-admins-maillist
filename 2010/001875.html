I concur not merely because of the ease at which a
LSB style init-script can be dropped into /etc/init.d/ and activated.
I concur due to the ease of which a LSB style init-script
can be created.

Some sources do provide LSB compatible init-scripts.
Some of the init-scripts or sample init-scripts
provided by software authors look like 20 pages of garbage.
In those situations I read the init-script,
make sense out of what it does,
and then write a LSB compatible init-script.
Learning enough to understand and write
a LSB compatible init-script only requires
reading only one tiny webpage.

<A HREF="http://refspecs.linux-foundation.org/LSB_4.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/initscrcomconv.html">http://refspecs.linux-foundation.org/LSB_4.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/initscrcomconv.html</A>

The web-page even has a new note in yellow at the bottom.
However at the time I began providing LSB compatible init-scripts
and introduced parallel execution of init-scripts during runlevels
the LSB documentation provided nothing to suggest
that parallel execution was possible or intended.
But to an extent parallel execution is possible.

With time the LSB specification for init-scripts
has become the long wide middle road.
It is more advanced than what was originally used in Sorcerer.
Yet it is not so advanced that it requires a replacement
for the System V style /sbin/init program.
This method lacks lightening speed
and my implementation is not high on lockfiles.
However, traveling the wide large well paved middle road
for init-script execution is not without benefits
with almost no sacrifice in simplicity.
The LSB method requires the exact same knowledge
of ordering as would required for the original method,
but without the headache of having to decide
init-script symbolic link numbers manually.

A method best suited to replace the current simple method
should also probably be able to execute LSB
compatible init-scripts without requiring modification
of the init-script nor additional information about the
init-script or services than what is provided in the init-script.
Basically, an ideal replacement would be a drop-in replacement.
That way we do not sacrifice the boon
of having a system for execution of init-scripts
that is backwards compatible with LSB.

Unfortunately, the LSB comments probably do not
provide enough information to be able to create
an ideal method of parallel execution.
Therefore, after a length amount of consideration
and honing we end up with a method for executing
init-scripts that not unlike what we already have.

Therefore, if a better more robust booting of boxes is desired
then the means to achieve that would be to create better
init-scripts that can anticipate and check for problems
then provide solutions and circumvention of those problems
automatically without having to provide a BASH prompt
to the SA without a clue about what to do.
