<PRE>Hi there...

How big is your power supply?

I use 1000W PSU, but that is because I have had issues with power
supplies before. I really have no idea of how much power my system
actually consumes.

Just through googling around a little, I come up with varying results
on power usage.

Some say memory uses 10w per 128mb, others say it's about 10W per stick.
Oh. if you have only one memory stick on your system, you might be
able to double the memory speed by adding another. Most modern
motherboards do a raid 0 on the memory, so the most important thing to
look for is FSB speed. If your motherboard is a modern one, your FSB
speed should be about a gigahertz. Memory speed is only half that for
the affordable stuff, so this is why manufacturers have moved to raid
0 on memory. They call is something different, but the effect remains
the same.

Hard drives use most power when spinning up, and then after that
relatively little.

Have you tried using the nvidia-settings program? There you can
underclock your GPU and try to lower the power consumption like that.

I have had some fun with a dodgey sound card. I got a replacement for
my sound card that blew, but now my machine is rebooting when I do a
lot of transcoding, but not when I load up the system with recompiles.
Hmm.. I might try to renice the transcoding and see if that makes a
difference.
