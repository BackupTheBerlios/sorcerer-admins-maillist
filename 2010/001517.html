<PRE>Okay a detailed analysis of the installation issues were asked for. And
considering that there are no documents related to installing Sorcerer,
and the emailed docs that are now in the recent archives of this list are
inaccurate (in that they do not describe what really occurs in
chronological order, and therefore leave out so much of what happens that
the user does not know what to skip or when - in fact, If I read it
correctly, it indicated to just do the install and let Sorcerer figure out
on it's own how to configure /etc/fstab, format the file systems, etc...),
I decided to do a write up on the installation program, showing exactly
what happens, when, in the hopes that this might shed some light on just
where SAs are having issues.

And I'm not a beginning SA either. IMO, given the current state of the
sinstall process, it would be better (even for a noob) to just perform the
fdisk, fstab, mkfs's, swapons, etc., by hand.

We really need to fix the sinstall process so it can be understood by
people, IMO, and I would like to help with that process as well as develop
a comprehensive set of docs to make the installation, compile, and
configuration process straight-forward and understandable.

This will go a long way towards the adoption of this really kewl distro :)


-----### The Installation Process as it currently is ###-----

Immediately after selecting the default keyboard mapping, a message is
displayed saying:

&quot;rpcbind: cannot bind * on udp6: address already in use&quot;
&quot;rpcbind: cannot bind tcp6: address already in use&quot;

then the screen to continue the boot process comes up. Selecting continue
boot displays:

&quot;Welcome to Sorcerer.&quot;
&quot;Please login as root.&quot;
&quot;Press enter for password.&quot;
&quot;/sbin/sinstall
to begin a menu driven installation.&quot;

Then a login prompt comes up, but before one can enter, 'root', and press
enter for the blank password they are disrupted by a message saying:

&quot;Fri Mar12 11:55:16&quot;
&quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sorcerer-admins">root at hostname</A>:~# /Mar 12 11:55:18 hostname.unknown kernel: Error: Driver
'pcspkr' is already registered, aborting...&quot;
&quot;Mar 12 11:55:18 hostname.unknown kernel: piix4_smbus 0000:00:07.0: SMBus
base address uninitialized - upgrade BIOS or use force_addrr=0xaddr&quot;

At this point, if you know what's going on, you can enter root in the
middle of a blank field, and then you'll get the password prompt.

When you enter the blank password, you receive a message saying:

&quot;~bash: /: is a directory

Fri Mar 12 12:05:47

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sorcerer-admins">root at hostname</A>:~#&quot;

At this point, if the user is not completely confused, they can enter
/sbin/sinstall, and bring up the installer.

lsmod (optional) #I do nothing

modprobe (optional) #I do nothing

rmmod (optional) #I do nothing

mbr (optional)  #I enter this, choose /dev/hda, and it sets the MBR
(presumably).

partition (optional) #I enter this, and create a /dev/hda1 of about
18GBytes (18431.86), set it bootable, create a /dev/hda2 of about 3GBytes
(3042.91), out of a total of 20GB, set its type to '83', write the new
partition table, and exit.

(That's actually the display from cfdisk, which I don't use. I use fdisk,
because I'm more comfortable with it, so the actual report is:

/dev/hda1	*	1	35714	17999824+	83	Linux
/dev/hda2		35715	41610	2971584		82	Linux swap / Solaris

At this point, the installer reports that both the 'mbr' and 'partition'
sections are &quot;complete&quot;, so I move on to &quot;modify_fstab (required)&quot;.

The user is presented with a rather confusing menu that displays the
following:

device		mount filesys option d o
/dev/hda1	none unknown defauults, natime 0 0
/dev/hda2	none unknown defaults, natime 0 0
/swap		none swap defaults 0 0

Now, I don't really have a problem with /etc/fstab, but getting through
this section is totally confusing.

I'll go through these one by one, saving &quot;device&quot; for last, since it is
the weirdest.

/dev/hda1:

Device	/dev/hda1
Mount	/
Filesystem	ext4
Options		defaults,noatime
Dump		0
Order		0
Feature		-0 dir_index,filetype,sparse_super
Check
Encryption
Empty		All fields removing entry

Basically, all I did was set the mount point to &quot;/&quot;, and chose the &quot;ext4&quot;
filesystem (which is the default). Everything else looks good to me.

Now on to the next partition, /dev/hda2, which I have designated as a 3GB
Swap partition, since this is a source based distro that needs a lot of
virtual memory for compile time.

Device	/dev/hda2
Mount	/
Filesystem	ext4
Options		defaults,noatime
Dump		0
Order		0
Feature		-0 dir_index,filetype,sparse_super
Check
Encryption
Empty		All fields removing entry

At this point, I do something wrong and the /dev/hda2 entry disappears, I
try to edit the /swap entry and it disappears too, then I try to check out
the device entry and something unintelligible flashes by the screen to
fast to tell what it says, I'm told that something didn't get completed,
and since I can't seem to put back the /dev/hda2 entry to give myself a
big swap disk, I move on...

Since I know that something has gone bad wrong, I checkout the entry
entitled, &quot;reload fstab&quot;. That seems to put everything back to the way it
originally was, so I go back and do the fstab again:

So I enter the /dev/hda2 again and set the mount point to /swap. Then I
set the filesystem to swap, when I come out of that screen, it says my
mount point is none, but that the filesystem is swap.

I figure that for some reason, the installer system must be correct so I
move ahead...

I enter the /swap selection on the screen that I had no understanding as
to why it existed in the first place (Interestingly enough, it said that
the swap size was only 256MBytes), select &quot;Device&quot;, then edit nothing
because something flashes across the screen and the menu appears again. I
&quot;Done&quot; exit back to the main fstab menu but before I get there it says

&quot;Essential fields are missing, Emptying entry.&quot;

It throws me completely out of the fstab edit sub-menu and back to the
installer. So I go back into the edit fstab sub-menu and this looks about
as good now to me now as it's going to (I've gone through this several
times - there are no docs to help out here.

It shows:

device		mount filesys options d o
/dev/hda1	/ ext4 defaults,noatime 0 0
/dev/hda2	none swap default 0 0


So, since I haven't been into the &quot;device&quot; entry yet, I do so:

hm... Okay now, it says, &quot;Please visit every menu item except the Empty
All Fields&quot;. So I will, but first, the display looks like this before I
edit it:

Device
Mount
Filesystem	swap
Options
Dump
Order
Size
Check
Empty		All fields removing entry


Note that there is a &quot;Size field instead of a feature field, and the
&quot;Encryption&quot; field is not there.

First, I go into &quot;Device&quot;, and something unintelligible flashes across the
screen.

Next, I go into &quot;Mount&quot; I enter /swap, but when exiting, it says &quot;none&quot;.

But it now says the following, which looks as good as I can get it (sine
it won't let me put /dev/hda2 into &quot;Device&quot;, and won't let me enter the
mount point of &quot;/swap&quot; either). So I make one more adjustment (to &quot;Size&quot;)
before moving on, noting the new settings below before doing so:

Device
Mount		none
Filesystem	swap
Options		default
Dump		0
Order		0
Size		3042 #(because, according to cfdisk, /dev/hda2 is 3042.91)
Feature		-0 dir_index,filetype,sparse_super
Check
Empty		All fields removing entry

&quot;Essential fields are missing, Emptying entry.&quot;, is the message I get at
this point, which I find interesting, so I go back into &quot;modify_fstab&quot;
from the main install menu to take a look:

It shows:

device		mount filesys options d o
/dev/hda1	/ ext4 defaults,noatime 0 0
/dev/hda2	none swap default 0 0

hm... I would prefer if that &quot;device&quot; entry wasn't there, since I don't
know what that is, but the other two entries look really good. Let's move
on...

modify_fstab is showing as (complete)

Since there aren't ANY installation docs (Which I'm considering writing as
a manual, BTW) the next two entries are &quot;init_filesys (optional)&quot;, and
&quot;mount (required)&quot;.

Now, I know you can't mount  before &quot;mkfs -t...&quot;, so I choose
&quot;init_filesys&quot; - even though it says &quot;optional&quot; - BECAUSE IT IS NOT
OPTIONAL - You MUST format the partition in real life before you can mount
and copy files over....

The screen says:
&quot;[ ] /dev/hda1		/ ext4 defaults,noatime 0 0&quot;
&quot;[ ] /dev/hda2		none swap default 0 0&quot;

Hey this looks good, actually, maybe I did it right this time! so I select
both and wait while the (presumably) mkfs -t ext4, mkswap, swapon, etc.,
whatever... goes through its process....

&quot;[*] /dev/hda1		/ ext4 defaults,noatime 0 0&quot;
&quot;[*] /dev/hda2		none swap default 0 0&quot;

It asks me to confirm that all data will be lost. Sure, no prob!

&quot;mkfs.ext4 -0 dir_index.filetype,sparse_super /dev/hda1&quot; appears to be the
command it's going to run. Looks good to me, so I select &quot;Yes&quot;.

&quot;writing inode tables: x/130&quot;...
&quot;creating journal (32768 blocks):&quot;...
&quot;Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done&quot;...

And then it takes the user back to a screen that says:

&quot;ext4 successfully created on /dev/hda1&quot;. I select &quot;OK&quot; and...

&quot;Please confirm it is okay that all data on /dev/hda2 is lost?&quot; I choose
&quot;Yes&quot;...

Now it says, &quot;mkswap /dev/hda2&quot;. I choose &quot;Yes&quot;...

&quot;swap successfully created on /dev/hda2&quot;. I  am about to choose &quot;OK&quot;, but
then the mount and install takes place and it always bombs on the
installation of files.

How does everything look so far? Did I do everything correctly? I've done
a lot of installing over the years, From MCC and SLS, and Yggdrasil LGX,
to many years of manually setting up fdisk and fstab with Slackware, but
this was really confusing for me.
