<PRE>there's no /bin/setsid and I'm not sure where it should come from.


...this is based from a iso 20100925 ia32 (oh, revisited, that's the
lasted ia32 image too, on silverice)

I had only just started installing this vmware image.  (quite some time ago)

today I learned I needed a linux box, so I started it up again and
started to update.

augur sync was ... confused a bit.

I finally got the network up, and managed a cast grimoire - which then
started puking becuase it didn't have several commands (version was
one)...
I used lynx, grabbed the latest sorcery (since I know these often come
in pairs), tried to extract it, but there's no 7za (thta's what I
would run under windows) p7zip?  ya no p7zip either.  Oh is see it's
xz, like the file extension - clever :)

This one had the correct modules fro the kernel, so I was able to
mount my windows shares, copied it out, extracted to a
'sorcery(...).tar' ran the install, did a augur sync (was unfortunatly
I was in in /root/.sorcery/grimoire looking for what 7zip was called,
so that started a long chain of 'indexing.... indexing....
indexing....' had to abort it (many ctrl-c's) moved out to /root and
got the augur sync to index.

augur scry is sitting with a bunch of perl-- modules in [wait] and
bin86[wait]  ... there are 274 spells in ~/.sorcery/queue/cast waiting
but no signs of motion

Oh ya /usr/libexec/sorcery/leech can't find /bin/setsid  nor can cast
... so I guess that's where I'm stuck.

okay I guess there is a download happening - but it's not appearing on
augur scry  (148 wait 1 download 132 aquire) 3 at the top are [wait]
then a list of the last few events; but no idea what sort of progress
the download is making.

... well whatever it was downloading that finished, so now I'm  (147
wait  132 aquire ) no download... and nothing going.

*shrug* I guess I can try and make some things go.... but I'm gone for now

</PRE>
