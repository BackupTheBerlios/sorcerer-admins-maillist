<PRE>First, the important stuff.
# augur progress $spell $version
That no longer sets a custom version.
Instead:
# augur progress $spell custom $version
# That set's the version progress for $spell to custom
and the version for $spell to $version.

And now for some good examples:

# echo rsyslog | augur avail
rsyslog av      5.6.4
rsyslog beta    5.7.8
rsyslog devel   6.1.5
rsyslog iv      5.6.4
rsyslog stable  5.6.4

iv happens to be what I am using for installed version.
av is used for available version.
However, beta and devel are available version progress.

# augur progress rsyslog devel

# augur progress
rsyslog devel

# echo rsyslog | augur avail
rsyslog av      6.1.5
rsyslog beta    5.7.8
rsyslog devel   6.1.5
rsyslog iv      5.6.4
rsyslog stable  5.6.4


And now the available version for syslog has changed to version 6.1.5

# echo rsyslog | augur avail av
rsyslog 6.1.5

That also verifies the change.

Notice also that I am not typing

# augur available rsyslog
6.1.5

Although I can type that it provides less information.
Short of looking at a spell
the avail augur command provides quick and easy to read information
about available version progress.

If wondering why &quot;iv&quot; and &quot;av&quot;
for &quot;installed version&quot; and &quot;available version&quot;, respectively
then that choice was to further minimize the size of the grimoire's index.
Perhaps at least installed version information did not have to be included
in the index, but it it is useful to see when using augur's &quot;avail&quot; command.

For software projects where the use of progress such as
&quot;secure&quot; &quot;unstable&quot; and &quot;legacy&quot; applies
then those spells can still use those version progress.

# echo libX11 | augur avail
libX11  av      1.4.0
libX11  iv      1.4.0
libX11  stable  1.4.0
libX11  unstable        1.4.1


And for SAs that dislike typing shift backslash to create the | pipe symbol
The above command can be typed by typing
augur avail
then type libX11
finally press ctrl-d to end input.

That nearly makes augur seem interactive.

Now to regress to the first paragraph of this email.
Using the version progress of custom to set a custom version makes sense.
But since this is arbitrary version progress
then an arbitrary name can be used also.

# augur progress rsyslog weird 6.2.0
# augur progress | grep rsyslog
rsyslog weird 6.2.0

# echo rsyslog | augur avail
Indexing Complete
rsyslog av      6.2.0
rsyslog beta    5.7.8
rsyslog devel   6.1.5
rsyslog iv      5.6.4
rsyslog stable  5.6.4

That example sets rsyslog's version progress to weird
and set's rsyslog's version to 6.2.0
Yes, it is custom, but it is also weird, is it not?
The same effect would happen if using devel or beta
as long an additional parameter follows the version progress.
That additional parameter becomes the version.

# augur progress
wine    unstable
rsyslog weird 6.2.0

In this example rsyslog's version progress is weird
while wine's version progress is unstable.
However, notice how the version for wine is not listed.
And yet the version is listed for rsyslog.
This indicates straight away that rsyslog's version
is fixed at version 6.2.0
So when subscribing to a version progress
please be careful to not include the version
or it will become fixed instead of updating
with the version progress.


Is not arbitrary version progress complex?
And yet this was a SA requested feature
by SAs that want me to do more work and
for them to do less spell editing and customization.  :)
Fortunately, arbitrary version progress is entirely optional.
When version progress is not specified for a spell
then that spell follows the stable version progress for updates.

So in summary arbitrary version progress can be used to
exile spells, to set to custom version,
to follow version progress the spell provides,
and to order delivery pizza.
Unfortunately, the pizza functionality is not included in this version
of sorcery.
However, please read augur's help screen
and the help screens for individual commands
to stay apprised of what they do.

# augur help progress


That will display a rather lengthy help screen
which explains how to use augur progress.
Good luck.
