<PRE>Boxes will run two sshd concurrently.
No this is not a mistake.

The primary sshd running on port 22,
which is the IANA assigned port number for ssh,
connects to the box's real root file system.

The secondary sshd running on port 30,
or the port specified in /etc/ssh/sshd_config_keep ,
connects to the keep.

In this fashion the keep is now available to SAs
without doing a virtual console login.

In addition ssh and scp are now provided on the initramfs
and therefore while logged into the keep the SA can easily
copy or access files from another computer via ssh.

Training in the keep is now more comfortable for SAs.
Instead of walking to a dev box and doing a boring virtual console login
please continue to enjoy the comfortable workstation chair.
Explore the keep from the comfort of X using
a terminal emulation program and ssh.

In addition this provides another benefit.
If a box becomes inaccessible via ssh after an update
then the sshd running on the keep will still be running.
Therefore, a SA can still
remotely log into the box via the keep and
then discover the problem.
Therefore, this change should makes remote boxes
somewhat more robust and accessible.
Such problems should already be very rare.
But we can sleep more comfortably with the safety net.

However, this change is not without drawbacks.
The sshd running on the keep will remain vulnerable
after openssl and opensshd receive security updates.
The openssl and openssh on the keep
update to the newer version when the box is truly rebooted.
Therefore, please add additional adequate security
precautions in order to protect the port assigned to the keep.
The port number is specified in /etc/ssh/sshd_config_keep
sshd on the keep can be disabled by running
# chmod 600 /etc/init.d/sshd_keep
Therefore, this enhancement is entirely optional
and can be disabled where the reward seems
less than commensurate with the risk.

This update will become available in a couple of days.
sshd on the keep will not start running until after reboot.
/etc/ssh/sshd_config is not modified.
/etc/ssh/sshd_config_keep is created from a stock /etc/ssh/sshd_config
with 2 lines modified.
Customize as desired.
Root login is not allowed by default.
Good luck.
