<PRE>Hi there, Sorcerer Admins.

This is something of an old debate, but I do have a few thoughts on
the subject, and would like to hear what other Sorcerer admins think.

I recently discovered that binutils was compiled with -O3, and created
an ld that was segfaulting on my hardware.
I forced it to -O2, and recompiled. ld no longer segfaults on my arch.
( Intel Centrino2 )



When I first started using Sorcerer, there were no CFLAGS in spells,
and whatever the SA decided to compile for was accepted. Being young
and on a slow machine, I compiled an entire system with -O3. --- And
was sorry I did. Not only did it take much longer to compile, it was
also horribly broke.

After reading quite a bit on the subject, and quite a few days
experimenting, me default is  -O2 since -O2 is what most binary
compiled software is shipped with. As such is by far the most tested
configuration.

Sorcerer's default -Os only makes a difference on ancient hardware
which has tiny cache and slow memory bandwitdh. On a modern machine I
can't tell the difference.

-O3 is used very rarely, because speed gains are not universal and
have to be measured on a case by case basis. Whatever speed gains are
achieved are offset against possible instabilities that this
optimization level may cause. A few notable exceptions are ffmpeg, and
Mesalib, for which the authors recommend -O3 for their sources, and
thus get a bit of testing.


So, it is my position that a distribution should not apply -O3 to it's
core utilities, like we are doing in bash and binutils. While this may
work on some architectures, it may be unstable on others, and we
should aim for stability rather than speed.

Sorcerer already has a tool for specifying special CFLAGS for specific spells.
The way I think it should work is as follows:

An SA like Kyle, that spends the majority of his time in bash, might
want to test bash with -O3. If it's stable enough, create a
/etc/sorcery/cpref file where -O3 is applied.
augur cpref $SPELL $CONF_FILE_NAME would then only apply -O3 for that spell.

Another SA might want to do it with mysql to squeeze a little more out
of the hardware available.

I use a lot of video stuff, so I would compile my video utilities with
-O3, and leave the rest of my boxen as stable as possible.


In the end, I suppose it boils down to this....


As a control freak Sorcerer SA, I want to have control over what
compiler flags my sources get compiled with. But I am also lazy, and
don't want to be over-riding all CFLAGS everywhere, as some spells
actually only compile with very specific compiler flags. Specifically,
I don't want to be overriding a spell's CFLAGS to make my box more
stable.

The CFLAGS in the spells then override the CFLAGS I specify in
/etc/cpref/default, as they should. Putting CFLAGS in spells are
useful when a spell is unstable/uncompilable with safe options, or
have very specific CFLAG requirements.



Lately I have seen -O3 cropping up in the grimoire more and more
often, and I feel that this is a practice that needs to be
discouraged, as it may make some architectures unstable.

Putting -O3 on spells should be done by the SA for spells on his own
system only, the only exceptions being sources where the source
authors actually specify -O3.
An SA that then want's to mess with a spell's CFLAGS can do so through
augur cpref, for his own box, but can't blame the distribution for any
instability that it causes.


I feel that even though Sorcerer is a sources-based distribution, I
would rather that Sorcerer be known for rock solid stability and ease
of maintenance.

Anybody have a different view?
