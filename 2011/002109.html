<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>The devel sorcery is nearly ready to become the stable sorcery.
It has many bug fixes, many changes, many new conveniences
and some things differ from the traditional sorcery used for years.

The first and foremost change is the least apparent.
cast dispel and leech have been sliced and diced to the point where
they run only as daemons, retrieve tasks from their respective queues
and do not process command line parameters.

Consequently, parameter parsing and dialog screens were moved into
augur modules.
This change makes cast, dispel, and leech smaller, more simple, single
layer programs.
They run faster, are easier to debug, and require less memory.
A more simple description is that each program was reduced to it's
essential parts.
The non essential parts that either might not run or run once and then
is no longer required
were moved into augur modules where they are discarded from memory
when no longer required.
Also as augur modules they are a bit easier to maintain.

SAs' concern now is now shifted to preparing the content of the cast,
dispel, and leech queue
before starting the action.
For that task augur is used.
In that respect it makes augur more like menu driven sorcery.
However, the main command to prepare the queues is definitely not menu driven.

The command to prepare queues is
# augur queue

To skip a lengthy description here is the output from
# augur help queue

The queue command lists adds or removes spells from the queues

Examples:

# augur queue                   lists the content of all queues.
# augur queue -bash             remove the bash spell from all queues.
# augur queue -cast/bash        remove the bash spell from the cast queue.
# augur queue firefox           adds firefox to the cast queue

When a timestamp, as described by man touch, proceeds a spell
then that spell is added to queue with the timestamp.
However, the time stamp is only applied
to the spell that it immediately proceeds.
spells may be provided as parameters or piped on stdin.

Useful examples to simulate legacy commands

To simulate: # augur clear
# augur queue | sed &quot;s:^:-:&quot; | augur queue



Preparing queues differs only slightly from legacy methods.
Yet the queue command is more flexible in how parameters are processed.
Also spells to add and remove to queues can be provided on standard input
instead as parameters for SAs that enjoy connecting programs with pipes.

Running
# augur queue

Prints the content of the queues.
Therefore, SAs can easily verify that the queues are proper
before executing

# augur begin

The begin command begins the invocation of dispel, leech, and cast
in order to process the queues.
However, it also first runs
# augur configure
and loads the leech queue as required
so that the spells in the cast queue can
will have required sources downloaded.

So overall it is not overly complex.
However, since this is sorcery
it does anticipate the odd things that SAs might try.

# augur begin firefox

That for example will do very much the same as:

# augur queue firefox
# augur configure
# augur begin

Therefore, if parameters are present or standard input is present
then the &quot;begin&quot; command will first execute the &quot;queue&quot; command.
I consider this a nice convenience.
However, Evert suggested that the conveniences are not enough.
So I compromised and created even more conveniences.

The first compromise which might not be indefinite is
that /usr/sbin/{cast,dispel,leech} check for the presence of parameters.
If parameters exist then they properly invoke
# augur queue
in order to set up the queue
So for the moment they function nearly as did their legacy counterpart.
But nothing other than a spell name can be processed as a parameter.
And the code for processing parameters still only exists in augur.

However,
# cast firefox

That command will not invoke a complimentary
# augur scry
nor
# augur scry $SPELL

It will however return to a bash prompt quickly,
because cast, dispel, and leech run in the background.

To ensure that SAs are fully pleased with devel sorcery
even further conveniences were added.
First, there are two new aliases added to root's environment.
&quot;au&quot; and &quot;aug&quot; can be typed instead of having to type &quot;augur&quot;
And command completion on &quot;au&quot; and &quot;aug&quot; works exactly
the same as if &quot;augur&quot; was typed instead.

Yet that is not the pi&#232;ce de r&#233;sistance or the most unconventional convenience.

# augur help a

Root's environment contains three aliases:

&quot;au&quot;  invokes augur.
&quot;aug&quot; invokes augur.
&quot;a&quot; is a convenience wrapper for augur.

Examples:

# a c $SPELL    augur begin $SPELL; augur scry $SPELL
# a d $SPELL    augur queue dispel/$SPELL; dispel
# a l $SPELL    augur queue leech/$SPELL; leech
# a r           moves spells from fail to cast queue then runs # augur begin
# a t $SPELL    augur begin $SPELL; augur check $SPELL


That is the help screen for the &quot;a&quot; module.

The following command line is rather lengthy to type
# augur queue firefox; augur configure; augur begin; augur scry firefox
and it can also be accomplished by typing
# augur begin firefox; augur scry firefox
Yet that is not nearly as fast to type as merely:
# a c firefox

The &quot;a&quot; alias is added to root's environment.
And in the future I might add new conveniences to &quot;a&quot;
that are too terse of an implementation to be worthy
of having their own module.

An example of that is the transition of the &quot;retry&quot; module to
# a r

Because &quot;a&quot; &quot;au&quot; and &quot;aug&quot; are implemented as aliases
they only work provided that root is running an interactive BASH shell.
They do not exist as scripts or files on disk.
And &quot;a&quot; &quot;au&quot; and &quot;aug&quot; can not be run from scripts
since they do not exist as file names.

So as comparison example:
# cast firefox
The above line is the legacy method for starting the compilation or
restoration of firefox as an installed spell.
It is short enough to be painless to type.
# a c firefox
Is the new method.
With a bit of practice it not only becomes as fast to type as the legacy method.
Since it requires one less key stroke it might even become faster to type.

Given the way this email began
did it seem as if the changes to sorcery
would become a terrible inconvenience for SAs?
Yet instead through much discussion and compromise
almost all of the goals were achieved
while the possibility of even greater convenience
was implemented with the new augur &quot;a&quot; module.
Yes it is a win/win/win scenario.
The changes achieve:
more speed; less RAM consumption; easier to maintain; more convenience;
and my favorite is the masterful method of queue manipulation with
&quot;augur queue.&quot;

Cultivate a habit of using # augur queue; augur begin
or the &quot;a&quot; conveniences
and then no tears will be shed when all legacy support is removed
and /usr/sbin/{cast,dispel,leech} no longer process parameters.


Given the above changes a SA might be wondering about changes to:
# augur easy
# augur sync
# augur newer
# augur update

Those commands still work exactly the same and should be used.
However, prior to executing # augur update
SAs can easily display and edit the queues using
# augur queue

Some SAs might be wondering about additional non spell parameters
that were accepted by the legacy cast and dispel.
Many of those parameters were made into features.
It is the best way to make them act consistently.
However, the new dispel offers no protection from SA blunder.
Spells queued for dispelling are removed
even when required by other installed software.

Output from:
# augur lone
# augur uproot

can be used to set the dispel queue.
However, for SAs that might want greater assurance
and prevention of blunderful dispelling
should probably use sorcery's menu driven dispel menu.
As we already know sorcery's selection of spells for removal
works exactly with the same logic as used to undress.
An example of that logic would be,
&quot;The option to remove socks does not become present
before shoes have been selected for removal.&quot;

With these changes the command line tools will very much
do as the SA requests without protest nor refusal.

Thanks for making time to read this summary of changes.
While it does not cover all the changes
the above should prevent the sudden onset
of the feeling of &quot;noobness.&quot;  :)


P.S.

While I am at the moment still testing it,
Evert suggested that the content of event logs
also be written to the tail of the cast/compile log.
That way
# augur log compile $SPELL
will have at the bottom the reason for an event such as a &quot;Auto Fail.&quot;
This seems like a fine idea,
especially since I still have yet to decide how
# augur event
should be adjusted to present additional verbose information
and yet still be easily sed; grepped or viewed on a 80x25 terminal.

Although changes were expected first quarter
the testing dragged on longer than expected
to ensure a higher level of quality.
Therefore, the new multilib I/R and improved sorcery
are obviously now expected sometime during this second quarter.
multilib sorcery and the changes to spells in the grimoire
have achieved a high degree of excellence.
So hopefully all this good stuff will be headed
to Sorcerer SAs in the very near future.

SAs eager to see the new sorcery in action
can change sorcery's progress to &quot;devel&quot; on their developmental box.
It probably will not cause any bad breaks.
But if it does then please report the problems.
