<PRE>Nobody was interested in Sorcerer with full selinux support.
Consequently, that subproject died a long time ago.

However, the use of mandatory access control to enhance security
is not a bad idea.
Yet finding the best implementation may prove challenging.

I recently began playing with tomoyo.
It seems to work decently.
It is include in the vanilla linux kernel.
It requires no helper libraries like selinux.
It has a learning mode like grsecurity.
It lacks a master password like grsecurity has.
Individual domains can be set to unenforced, learning mode, report
mode, or enforced mode.

It is effective for creating boxes for remote services.
That way if the security of the remote service is thwarted
then access to which files can be read, modified, and executed
can remain limited even if the account has root access.
Consequently, a service can be &quot;locked in the box.&quot;
It is a bit like a chroot jail, without the chroot,
and with the ability to disable the ability to mount a path out.

What I have in mind differs somewhat.
Rather than harden the security of individual services
I would rather erect a diamond wall.
Consequently, when not in a permissive domain
then I prefer that the full illusion of root access
be given yet with the limitations of not actually
being able to modify files in /etc /bin /sbin /usr /opt, etc...

A clever Sorcerer SA had a method for this
by segregating file systems on different mount points
and remounting them read-only when expected that
they should not be modified.
The flaw of this method is the same as security by obscurity.
The defense is overcome by merely knowing
that the file system must be remounted read-write.

Anyway, I digress.
What I want to explain is that I can probably achieve
the type of security that I desire with tomoyo.
It would involve careful implementation of domains
that have many regular expressions.

However, does anyone else have a preferred method
that perhaps unlike tomoyo can be made to enforce
permissively except where explicitly denied?

Ultimately, what I desire is not only enhanced security
where all services are properly locked in their boxes,
but also where gaining full root privilege requires running /bin/sulogin
That way if effective user ID 0 is awarded by sshd or
by exploiting a bug in a root owned process
then full root privilege is not granted until
we are certain that the user
has truly authenticated himself with the root password.

Does this seem like a good idea?
Is anyone in the boat with me on this idea?
I am not saying that we must use tomoyo
to implement enhanced security.
But unless someone has a better suggestion
then tomoyo seems like a method
that can accomplish the task with a reasonable
amount of headache and toil.

Once enhanced security is implemented
then nothing will differ from a user's point of view.
However, gaining root will become slightly more
annoying since we will be typing
$ /sbin/sulogin -p
instead of
$ su -

And before anyone asks why not with
# su -
the answer is that # su -
does not prompt for a password
because the effective user id is already root.

Additionally, I want to provide limited default rules
for services that should operate
the same on all Sorcerer boxes such as ntp.
Consequently, Sorcerer SAs that do not want to learn tomoyo,
but want to keep the enhanced security
will only have to learn to type
# /sbin/sulogin -p
and
$ /sbin/sulogin -p

Therefore, all gain and no pain for lazy Sorcerer SAs.
And the rest of us will have a reasonable tool for
locking each process into a form fitting box.

It might not be a perfect solution.
A user with a rootkit might be able to gain effective root access,
but without the full privilege of root.
Consequently, no change could be made to /etc /sbin /bin /usr /opt
And perhaps /var and /home can also be protected.
The unauthorized root would probably be able to
to run processes as root, perhaps bind to port &lt; 1024,
and maybe kill other processes.
Yet hopefully the limit of the damage that could be done
could be stopped short of allowing any change
that would survive reboot.

The full scope may be difficult to achieve.
With tomoyo domain transition is achieved
when a new process is run.
Therefore, the controlling domain does
not have an apparent correlation with the user id.
Yet this transition based upon user id
might be an a task that can be accomplished.
Yet without it an unauthorized root acquired by exploiting
a bug would probably gain sufficient permission to
# rm -r /home
Or sneakily modify/plant certain files
in someone else's home directory.

Hopefully, that explains the concept of the virtual diamond wall.
The virtual diamond wall allows the normal level
of user permission that one would expect.
However an unauthorized acquisition of root encounters
a transparent yet impenetrable wall that prohibits file modification
until explicit authentication with sulogin is achieved.

It seems like an easy concept yet unfortunately is a challenging implementation.
Does anyone else like the idea and want for a Sorcerer box that can do that?


P.S.

grsecurity can nearly accomplish the diamond wall effect out of box
by having an uberuser password which one must authenticate with
before gaining the full privilege of root.
Unfortunately, grsecurity is not part of the vanilla kernel.
