<PRE>That is a good point.
-O2 is part of the Sorcerer's default optimization.
It has long been a reliable stable optimization.
It is not as fast as compilation with -O or -O0

I feel reasonably safe using -O3 on software
that I use regularly and have tested and expect
that it can entirely use a core.
However, I do not mind discontinuing the use of -O3
if that is the consensus.
The two main reasons for -O3 is performance and
to deter SAs from trying -O3 on spells that do not have it.
However, if we want to ban the use of -O3 distribution wide
then sorcery can be made to check and replace -O[3-9] with -O2.

If going in the direction of less optimization for preferred stability
then another question that might be worth asking is which software
aught to be compiled -O0?
-O0 is produced no optimization with minimal compile time.
How much of KDE benefits from -O2 or firefox?

Possibly, we may want to reconsider Sorcerer default optimization?
Why not use -O0 -march=native for default optimization
and use -O2 on source that is expected to be capable of
running a core full bore?

&gt;<i>From the gcc manual page:
</I>
       -O3 Optimize yet more.  -O3 turns on all optimizations specified by -O2
           and also turns on the -finline-functions, -funswitch-loops,
           -fpredictive-commoning, -fgcse-after-reload, -ftree-vectorize and
           -fipa-cp-clone options.

If someone has a source for which -O3 is unusable
then a good exercise might be to compile it with -O2
and enable each of the above optimizations and try
the outcome to see which optimization makes the code
segfault or the program not run properly.

The reason we use -O2 on everything is basically the same
reason that noob SAs would want to try -O3 on everything.
But I have long known -O2 is overkill because most processes
do not hog the CPU.

So how about -O2 for CPU intensive software
such as glibc, gcc, xz, bash, coreutils, MesaLib, etc...
and -O0 for everything else that runs gently
or spends most of it's time sleeping?
And sorcery can prohibit the SA from setting -O3,
because those additional optimizations can specified
individually if desired.
