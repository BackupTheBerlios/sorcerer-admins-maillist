<PRE># augur req
works exactly the same as the functions it exposes.
It accepts spell names on stdin
and it writes spell names on stdout.

Yet some SAs are either displeased or perplexed
by having to provide spell names on standard input.
Luckily today I am providing a lesson in BASH
that shows examples of # augur req
that are not shown by # augur help req

Naturally, I show only one method in # augur help req
I do not want to confuse SAs
that are new to BASH scripting.
However, as expected there is usually
2 or more methods for BASHing something.
Below I demonstrate 4 methods.

To start with let us assume that we want an arof list for MesaLib.
arof stands for &quot;All Requirements Of&quot;
Therefore, the arof list for MesaLib are all the spells
that must be installed before MesaLib can be installed.

Method 1:

# echo MesaLib | augur req arof

Method 2:

# augur req arof
MesaLib
^d

And the ^d means holding down the control key while pressing d.

Method 3:

# augur req arof &lt;&lt; EOF
MesaLib
EOF

EOF is just the capital characters E O and F.
However, any single word will work in place of EOF.
Just chose something other than a spell name such as.

# augur req arof &lt;&lt; WTFisSTDIN
MesaLib
WTFisSTDIN

And for those who are wondering exactly that.
stdin or standard input is whatever input
is connected to a program.
Input might come from the keyboard.
It might come from a device.
It might come from the forking process that
starts the new process.
It might come from a pipe.
It might come from a socket.
stdin could even come from across the Internet.
When expecting more than a handful of bytes
then the choice method for input is stdin.

Method 4:
# augur req arof &lt;&lt;&lt; MesaLib

Method 4b:
# augur req arof &lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;MesaLib
firefox
aumix&quot;

Method 4b allows for addition spells to be specified
until the SA closes off the string by adding the second double quote character.
And yes, spell names must be separated by a line feed.

I have read the bash manual page more than 100 times.
However, just reading it slowly once
might be sufficient in order to learn alternate methods.
Method 3 shows an example of &quot;Here Documents.&quot;
Method 4 shows an example of &quot;Here Strings.&quot;

When I taught system administration
I provided assigned reading to students.
I recommended all the manual pages
installed by: coreutils, grep, bash.
The list seemed longer back then
because coreutils had not yet become.
It was provided by binutils, shellutils, and textutils.
Also the manual page for findutils,
and the info page for sed are useful.
I did not expect my students to write BASH scripts.
I only expected them to gain enough knowledge
so that if they must write BASH scripts
then they would know where to look
in order to begin the task.

There is no requirement for any senior level SA
to become my student.
However, does any senior level SA
wanted to admit knowing less than
what my students know?
:<i>)
</I>
There are additional more complicated methods.
I leave the learning to the SA to discover them.
Probably most SAs will be satisfied with method 4.
Method 4 is probably the fastest
I hope this helps.

I intend to leave # augur req
the way it is now.
It will only accept spell names on stdin
and not as additional parameters.

I do this not to invoke the ire of SAs.
I do this to motivate them to learn
what they should already know.

A SAs's power is almost directly proportional to their BASH scripting skill.
If not BASH then whatever shell they prefer like C Shell or Korn shell
becomes their wand from which their magic is manifest.
Do we prefer that our wands remain tiny and flaccid?
Or do we prefer that our wands become long and erect?
Make time to open those tomes that we call manual pages.
Make time to hone the magic.
The modern magic is waiting to flow into
anyone who dares to comprehend it!
