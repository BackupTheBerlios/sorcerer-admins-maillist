Okay I'll try to respond to this with my take on it, w/o being too
verbose ;)

Yes. I agree that is good. However, there's a point further down that

</I>
I'll be honest here, I haven't seen the immediate prior, or the the I/R
just before that. I think the last I/R I used was from about a year ago.

I did give up trying to install KDE, etc., because the casts kept
failing and I was lost in the ever moving augur target. Trying old, way
past deprecated things such as scry that weren't even currently used
that way, etc.

So not only are my Sorcerer boxes cli based servers (and running good I
might add), but I'm not familiar with the latest install script.

That having been said, expert is what it is. Novice, to me means, &quot;Hold
my hand a little and explain things in a manner that won't insult my
level of experience as a seasoned admin, because I just need to know
what *This* requires of me.&quot;

The last install I did was sufficient for me, and I know you've made
improvements upon that since.

Automatic... um... yeah, I'll address that below too...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So maybe an automatically created /boot partition for &quot;novice&quot; mode,
</I>&gt;<i> and merely the 2G size enforcement for &quot;expert&quot; mode?
</I>&gt;<i> I can not help making the &quot;novice&quot; mode of the installer
</I>&gt;<i> extremely unpalatable for experienced SAs.
</I>&gt;<i> But we always that the option to switch modes and re-partition.
</I>
I liked the last install I did, with one exception. It told me what I
needed to do as far as run fdisk, create your partitions, swap, choose
your mount points, etc.

Great for the seasoned SA, who is worried he/she might forget a step,
but knows how to do it with a couple of nice reminders. This is usually
my choice on an install, to, &quot;Tell me what I need to do and in what
order, and let me do it myself&quot;.

Something unique, that I like in what you've done, is to enforce a
minimum of 2GB for a /boot - but only where it's required (i.e., not
with ext3 or ext4).

Now, for the problem I had, which (and this might sound a little stupid
on my part) by default, wanted to create an /etc/fstab with a *swap
file*, instead of mounting SWAP on it's own type 82 partition.

I had never done that before, and the thought of it actually makes me
cringe. I have, for the past 18yrs or so, always created a type 82
partition, and put my swap there.

In my case, I had to run sinstall twice before I figured out how to do
that in one step. Once to get through the fdisk and fstab part of the
install, and once to point choose the now existing partition as the
place to mount swap.

That might sound silly, but I still do not understand why someone would
want a swap file, instead of a swap partition.

Okay, moving on. From what it sounds like (and I'll create a new VM in
vmware  to see it for myself in a few minutes here), the requirement now
is that an SA *must* create a /boot of *at least* 2GB &quot;if&quot; he chooses
something like xfs, which needs one - perfect!

Anything more isn't 'novice', IMO, but rather, n00b, and deserves to be
below in your proposed *Automatic* mode ;)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The novice mode could be made to query an installation device from the SA
</I>&gt;<i> and automatically create a 2G ext2 /boot partition, 4G swap, and to put
</I>&gt;<i> the rest on an ext4 / or is that too harsh?
</I>
To reiterate and clarify, too harse, IMO :)

&gt;<i> Besides an ext2 /boot would probably be unnecessary with an ext4 /
</I>
Precisely.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Should the menu driven installer have a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;novice&quot; mode an &quot;expert&quot; mode and an &quot;automatic&quot; mode?
</I>
I'll never use an *automatic* mode, but yes, I think that's a good idea...

&gt;<i> Perhaps it should start in automatic mode and ask the SA just one questions?
</I>&gt;<i> Which /dev/sd* device to install Sorcerer?
</I>
Okay this isn't something that most of us will use, yet I think perhaps
it's not a bad idea so people coming to the distro can just say, install
on /dev/sda and off it goes. Yes. for &quot;Automatic&quot; - something I would
never use.

I believe it will make it more palatable for some to adopt Sorcerer.
They just want to see a box light up. Then, hopefully, they fdisk and do
it right later once they know it's bitchen.

And another point you raised a couple of times here, is that many of us
(including myself) had to change the way we think when it comes to
Sorcerer, in regards to what should be sufficient for a /boot - due to
they way we had been raised, so to speak ;)

for example, back in the 386 days, it was enough to create a /boot of
8MBytes  on a Maxtor 514MByte drive that had more than 1024 Cylinders ;)


&gt;<i> With merely the answer to that question
</I>&gt;<i> I can lay that down a Sorcerer installation
</I>&gt;<i> faster and easier than a 4 course meal.
</I>&gt;<i> Is that what new Sorcerer SAs actually require
</I>&gt;<i> so that Sorcerer is no longer too difficult to install?
</I>
That's a judgement call on your part Kyle. I'll never use an automatic.
In fact, I looked at an automatic install once in the Redhat 4 or 5
days, just to see - it was ugly, but perhaps necessary for the sake of
adoption. As I recall, it would build a system that wasn't even usable
for longer than a month or so.

And I was also totally freaked out around the RH 6 time, when I first
saw that disk druid thingy. Gawd I hate it when a company insists that
we use those distros.


&gt;<i> then we can abandon all hope of him/her being able to deploy
</I>&gt;<i> a console only server box.
</I>
Usually all I need. I run mostly Slackware, Sorcerer and yes, a deb
server here and there when I think that someone else will be taking over
the admin from me later.

Although I would really like to try a Sorcerer workstation out and see
how all that comes together, it didn't happen for me starting with the
I/R's I was using as late as six or eight months ago.

But having come from Jolix, SLS, Slack, Yggdrasil, etc., I just don't
see any other way to manipulate a disk other than fdisk - I don't even
like the cfdisk front end, or care much for that grub stuff either LOL.

The problem with making novice too n00b, is I often mount my /home off
somewhere in the distance and traditionally like a /var on it's own
partition too (for no good reason anymore). having /usr/local separate
is nice too sometimes ;)

Just the prompts telling me what I should be doing next, and yes, to
avoid the botching of an install, your safeguard to require a 2GB+ /boot
when necessary is all I need. More importantly, I think that's all most
people need.

Once more, the ONLY thing I had a problem with before, was figuring out
how to get through the /etc/fstab process by deleting the swap file and
having a swap partition instead.


&gt;<i> I can not help thinking that an automatic installation
</I>&gt;<i> is like giving a noob a stick of C7H5N3O6 to use for a match.
</I>
It is.


&gt;<i> Or will it explode in their face later?
</I>
It will. But... perhaps (If you think it's desirable to move forward
with such an endeavor) you could call it an Automatic *Trial* install,
or *Test Drive* install, to enforce the principle that such an install
is merely a peek, and only that.

As far as helping. um... Well just a couple of things. First, I heard
that you used to yell at your developers sometimes. Just hearsay, and I
don't know the context or if they were being pricks themselves.

Second, I have limited time, so progress on such a thing would move
slowly, yet would be a kewl project for me nevertheless to work on.

Third, I do have, once again ;), unlimited bandwidth, resources, my own
Portable IPs under direct assignment from nic.ddn.mil (No, think back
way further than internic.net) - so I have a perfect platform for distro
devel in a vmware environment. And I'm at One Wilshire now :)

So if you can put up with what might be from time to time, extensive
delays (life happens, gotta feed my daughter, and I still need a real
job or more clients), stupid questions, maybe a little extra hand
holding (I'm a careful admin), I'd like to try if you wanna move forward
on that, and the other thing I had been looking at contributing was a
spell for Twin, a window manager I have come to love that runs in/out of
X, etc.

I'm a believer in giving back. You can call me a collector, or a
believer, but I always keep a Slackware subscription, not because I want
the official DVDs (I never open them), but because Pat needs money to
feed his family and continue that distro.

Now that Mageia I is out, I can leave that distro to its own destiny, as
I really hate rpms as much as I ever did. I only helped out there
because I liked Mandrake for some reason, and despised Mandriva.

I like Sorcerer, and I apologize for not having been able to offer more
support related articles about it on my website.

Kindest regards,
