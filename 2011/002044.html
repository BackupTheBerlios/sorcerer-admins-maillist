<PRE>If size is a concern
then I can start providing sdelta patches for I/Rs.
However, few people know how to apply sdelta patches manually.
And more recently, I was providing I/R
rolled from different boxes and therefore with
completely different sets of archives.
I even re-compressed archives to achieve a smaller I/R.
Without making the I/Rs sloppy they are nearly minimalistic.

The days of a 100 megabyte I/R are gone.
But for a few megabytes more the I/R can have more
of the useful stuff like vlc &lt;- for a video player,
and firefox &lt;- for web browsing.

KDE and firefox are the software projects that require the longest to compile.
Having them provided pre-compiled helps mitigate
the time requirement gap between installing Sorcerer
as opposed to installing a pre-compiled binary based distro.
SAs can still remove the software after installation
and/or change the optionals and recompile.

Unfortunately, console only I/Rs are problematic due to
a few core software projects that have requirements on xorg components.

# augur arof udev | grep libX11
libX11

While there might be other reasons at least one pivotal point
is the requirement on gobject-introspection.
Unfortunately, support of gobject-introspection must be nearly all or nothing
rather than being able to select freely on individual spells.

Probably the closest that Sorcerer can come to being a hybrid distribution
is to provide a good selection of software for the initial installation.
Because SAs can selection optionals for installed spells
each box diverges from the I/R configuration
when the SAs start selecting optionals.
Therefore, upgrades of installed software must still be compiled.

An I/R is a compromise between size and convenience.
Trying to go smaller causes or invites potential problems.
Going large makes for a longer download
and increases the probability of encountering an error when reading the CD.
But it could shave a few hours off of the time to full deployment
for a workstation with KDE, xine, firefox and vlc.

Overall size should still remain favorable because this would be an I/R
with an expanded selection of software rather than a &quot;live CD&quot; type I/R.

Options are:
network install CD which lacks archives archives must be downloaded
with curl over Internet;
moderate Install/Rescue CD with xorg which is the style we currently use;
expanded Install/Rescue CD with additional firefox, vlc, and perhaps KDE;
live CD with horrible zisofs per file gzip level compression.

A network install CD seems smaller to download,
but that is only because more downloading is done during installation.
Also it is far less use as a rescue CD.
The only advantage to a network install CD is that it tiny and fast to
write to CD
with a minimal probability of encountering bad CD sectors.
If xz/LZMA initramfs images worked with linux
then a 40M to 50M network install I/R could be possible.

The moderate install CD has all the advantages and disadvantages that we expect.
As a baseline for comparison it is not excessively large nor
excessively convenient.

The expanded CD costs more in size and downloading, but provides
greater convenience.
Workstation deployment could be nearly as fast as using a pre-compiled
binary based distro.
All the software to install is still provided just on that one CD and
so there is no volume
of CDs to burn nor the requirement of using a DVD writer instead of CDs.
Installation of additional software comes at the usual expense of
downloading and compilation.

The live CD is nearly the opposite of a Sorcerer box.
The pathetic level of compression makes it very large to download
while providing even less software than can be provided on an expanded I/R.
Even back in the days when Sorcerer was provided with zisofs with
rockridge extensions
I am uncertain if it was worthy of being called a live CD.
It was moderately large and had no X11 pre-installed.

Software like firefox and xorg that would be expected to be installed
on nearly every box seems logical to include on an Install/Rescue image.
A default media player like vlc could also be useful.
Maybe half of Sorcerer SAs use KDE.
I have been using it for a few years now.
The long and somewhat linear time required in order to compile
KDE makes it good candidate to come on an I/R.
But I am not entirely convinced
since the inclusion of KDE could increase the I/R size
by about 250 to 300 megabytes.
In contrast firefox + vlc would fill up about as much space
as samba used to require on the Install/Rescue disk
But I see that I already discontinued providing samba.
Hopefully the omission did not cause inconvenience.
