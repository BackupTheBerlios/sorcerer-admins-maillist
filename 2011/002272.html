<PRE>/var/{lock,run}/ are now supposed to be directories and not symbolic links.
I was being annoyed at how the symbolic links would sometimes be overwritten
when a spell installed something such as ConsoleKit or gdm.
Therefore, those directories are now binds to /run/lock and /run, respectively.
That should eliminate any problems concerning those.

sorcery used to remove /sys/fs/cgroup/sorcery/ after completing.
That was potentially annoying because removing the control group
also relinquished it's resource allocation settings.
Consequently, on the subsequent run sorcery could compete
with the user and daemon control groups for up to half the CPU cylces.
This will no longer happen.

sorcery control group will have it's limited 16 cpu.shares.
Additionally, the sub control groups of sorcery: cast; dispel; leech
now receive individual resource allowances.
That way the majority of CPU cycles and blockio.weight belongs to cast.
leech and dispel will compete for scraps.

The proper amount of CPU time for sorcery to consume when competing
against other control groups is 1/64th or less.
That should maintain calm waters while updating,
which is something that might not have been happening on all boxes.

Evert suggested that glibc locale database generation should only happen
when the ac adapter is plugged into a laptop.
I agree.
And I made that change a while ago.
However, I neglected to notice that the function generating
the locale databases was not correctly joining with the idle control group.
I fixed this.
Now the generation of locale archives will happen at boot
using background an incredibly slim 1/512th of CPU cycles,
or more provided that the cycles would be otherwise idle.

locale databases are used for native language translation.
A complete set is not required.
A subset can be selected by running
# /etc/init.d/locale-archive configure

The locale-archives are not generated on every boot.
They are generated on the first boot after installation
or after glibc is re-installed.
So in general the /etc/init.d/locale-archive script
has received far more improvement that warranted
for something that infrequently performs a duty.

I have not yet surmised a passable solution for using
gdm on an NVIDIA twinview configuration.
However, for those who can use gdm
then gnome 3.2.0 should be mostly usable.
gnome-terminal crashes.
And I adjusted gnome-session's fallback
to run mutter instead of metacity.
mutter works okay.
It is less fancy than gnome-shell.
However, gnome-shell does not render properly on all boxes.

gnome-shell however does render properly with NVIDIA twinview.
Unfortunately, gdm errors and does not permit login.
Consequently, if not too inconvenient then users might want to
login using xdm or kdm and then change the window manager to gnome-shell.
That much accomplishes nearly the same as starting with gdm.

I do not warranty the software that comes from gnome authors.
I probably spend more time struggling with it than the average SA.
As far as I can tell the installation should be good enough to run.
And it runs fine on some boxes.
If it breaks feel free to keep the pieces.
I am only doing extremely modest distribution wide fixes-workarounds
and am not willing to rewrite unfortunate gnome code.

Please do not forget that /var/{lock,run}/ will now be directories
that are bound and no longer symbolic links.
That way it will not look strange when looking for potential problems.
Good luck to anyone who wants to run gnome 3.
I recommend using the LAG=0 grimoire after the next UTC 00:00
for the best probability of success.
