<PRE>I removed the sorcerer-i686-UP iso9660 images from download.
I realized that the RAM required for
( the kernel + the compressed initramfs image +
64M for decompression + the uncompressed initramfs image )
&gt;<i> ( installed RAM on stock PentiumM Centrino laptop. )
</I>
Installation is probably impossible
unless the amount of installed RAM is upgraded.
And running Sorcerer on it would be undesirable
unless it has at least 1G of 400 MHz RAM.

Not to imply that I am always correct.
But definitely I was wrong and Evert was correct.
Linux is bootable on ancient computers,
however the specifications for Sorcerer requires
the stock configuration of a more modern box.
Yet, I sometimes expect that
I can make Sorcerer run
even on 10 year old athletic shoes.


I was among the many SAs that were displeased
about relinquishing a custom kernel
that boots quickly without an initramfs.
As a compromise
I wanted an initramfs with nearly all the utilities that
SAs would require in order to rescue or repair a box.
That compromise best approximates the advantages
enjoyed on a box that can boot without initramfs.
And since Sorcerer boxes are
required to have sufficient installed RAM
then why not make optimal use of it?
That is why the Sorcerer initramfs is large instead of tiny.

My plan for a large initramfs was
exactly the opposite of what all other distros were creating.
They wanted tiny initramfs.
They were trying to cut down the loadout of an initramfs
to essential boot only utilities provided by busybox
or other utilities suitable for use in embedded systems.
And they were using tiny cut down
C library implementations such as uClibc or klibc.
And yet in stark contrast
the Sorcerer I/R has real glibc,
a full selection of kernel modules, firmware,
and large useful slice of the installed operating system.

Perhaps this is interesting or perhaps not,
but sometimes Sorcerer does
very much the opposite of what other distros are doing.
And again Sorcerer continues the defiant trend
by taking the extreme to the next step.
Sorcerer might be the only distro that
keeps the initramfs that was used during boot;
allows SAs to use the initramfs while the box is running;
and to uses the initramfs again during reboot/shutdown.

The bold step in this direction of embracing the utility
instead of minimizing and discarding
what others expect is a waste of memory;
also burns the bridge that leads backwards
to a possibility of becoming a distribution
that runs on legacy computers.
Sorcerer boxes require 256M to boot, 512M to install,
but should have no less than 1G for deployment.

Sorcerer methods often defy the current norms.
They seem counter-intuitive.
And the evolution of Sorcerer's init is a good example.
Yet what seem defiant now might become the norm for the future.

Foolish or coolish?
At least we can give it a try,
and with sufficient retrospect decide.
