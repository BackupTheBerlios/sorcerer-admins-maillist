It is not difficult to do with dialog.
The problem is that 60+ menus to visit in wizard mode
would annoyingly try the frustration of anyone.
Also making a mistake can require going backwards through
a huge number of wizard screens.
Wizard screens grant no possibility of doing part
of the installation manually and part by the menu driven installer.
A wizard would also further limit the possible amount of installation types.

The novice menu install mode is somewhat like a wizard mode.
Already the lack of installation types is evident.
But instead of doing back and next one uses the up and down arrow keys
on the main menu to progress or revert to previous steps.
And it also checks and disallows certain actions such as:
&quot;The fstab menu can not be accessed while file systems are mounted.&quot;
I suppose I can make the highlighted menu option bounce around
automatically based upon what steps are completed or desired.
That way the SA might not have to use up and down arrow keys on the main menu.
It will be more self-guiding.
How would that be for intuitive?


&gt;<i> The next best in my humble opinion would be a completely manual
</I>&gt;<i> install coupled with some clear documentation, like LFS does. With
</I>&gt;<i> maybe a helper script or two to automate the more tedious tasks that
</I>&gt;<i> simply cannot vary, like transferring over the data.
</I>
There are so many tiny things that a SA could forget
such as marking a partition as bootable,
regenerating symbolic links to init-scripts,
regenerating the initramfs, writing a bootable MBR,
editing /etc/lilo/head, running /etc/init.d/lilo, etc...
The menu driven installer grants a higher probability
that the first boot to fixed disk will be successful.
However, SAs can do a manual install if they know
everything that must be run chrooted and run it.

Maybe it can be blamed on Sorcerer,
but it seems to me that the minimum requirements
for a decently modern bootable box these days
makes for a somewhat more complicated installation.
/dev is generated and not static;
symbolic links to init-scripts are not pre-numbered but generated instead;
new boxes boot by initramfs,
initramfs images are generated and not static.
Sorcerer tailors all of those things because it is not
a one-size fits all pre-compiled binary based distro.
Each Sorcerer box will have it's own unique initramfs images.
So there is a bit to do in order to deploy a box.


&gt;<i> However... these days I just restore a backup of a Sorcerer root
</I>&gt;<i> partition into a clean partition, fiddle with fstab and lilo to
</I>&gt;<i> reflect the new computer Sorcerer will be running on, and make it
</I>&gt;<i> bootable and off I go...
</I>
That works easily because the backup is just like a deployed Sorcerer box,
while the I/R is not like a deployed Sorcerer box.
The only similarity is that the I/R has a linux kernel and initramfs.
I doubt making a file system and copying the content of the I/R raw
to that file system will produce something bootable,
let alone usable as a deployed Sorcerer box.
The I/R is not like a &quot;live CD&quot;
therefore &quot;some assembly is required.&quot;

xor ax,ax
push dx
call   ds:[0x4a4]

Wait no; not that type of assembly!  :)
