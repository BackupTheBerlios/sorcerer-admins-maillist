<PRE>If time is scarce then do not bother reading this message.
It is of no importance to driving a Sorcerer box.

<A HREF="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/">http://upstart.ubuntu.com/</A>

Approximately, a couple years ago some Sorcerer SAs
wanted to participate in the race to create the fastest booting system.
Nothing changed about Sorcerer's boot method.
However, Ubuntu made the transition from SysVinit to Upstart.

Any new method can be made to boot faster than a SysVInit based method,
because slow init-scripts and a slow method for executing init-scripts
can be implemented.
Back in the days when Debian used perl for running init-scripts
booting required a long time.
Perl start time was much slower than bash.
Most init-scripts ran;
looked for an installed daemon's file that was not installed;
and then exited because there was nothing to start.
That type of boot implementation can be extremely slow.

However, as any boot method approaches optimal efficiency
then the majority of time consumed during boot is not spent by the the CPU,
but rather on waiting for slow mass storage devices to deliver file content.
Therefore, an attempt to load all CPU cores can also bottleneck I/O.
Files that could be used sooner might be delivered later.

A mass storage device is not like a quad core CPU.
A mass storage device delivers blocks from a disk,
at the rate which the drive can sling the head around and read the data.
Requesting more blocks at a time does not make
them fly off the disk at a faster rate.
To the contrary the more frequently disk heads must move
then the slower the data will be read.
Therefore, trying to read 15 files concurrently
is usually slower than reading 15 files linearly,
even when a fixed disk has several heads and platters.

Unlike /sbin/sysvinit; the upstart daemon requires Python and dbus.
Is upstart the reason why providing tmpfs on /var/lock and /var/run is
problematic on Ubuntu?
Did programmers confuse &quot;can do&quot; with &quot;should do?&quot;

Having worked as a professional SA
I recognize that SAs often wear many non-SA hats.
They are expected to be the software engineers
that can do anything and everything.
Therefore, the overworked and underpaid professional SA
does not want the additional burden of spending
an hour learning the intricacies of a new boot method
that promises to shave 10 seconds off the boot time
provided that they also defrag files.  *lol*
Provided that the gain remained a constant 10 seconds, which it would not,
then at least 360 boots while the SA waits
are required before the SA regains the hour spent on training with upstart.
Would such a change be worth doing on Sorcerer?

My reason for being critical of upstart
is to demonstrate by contrast
that under my leadership this last decade
the changes made to Sorcerer have brought more boon than bane.
Careful evaluation of boons vs banes are made prior to implementing changes.
I explicitly state this not due to a desire to gloat.
Instead I perceive the importance of the continuation of this tradition.
&quot;Can do&quot; and &quot;Should do&quot; are two entirely different equations that
should not be confused.
I hope that those who participate in the leadership of Sorcerer
will continue this tradition of careful evaluation.
