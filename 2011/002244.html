</I>
I originally selected /dev/cgroup becasue
that was being shown in the documentation
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/cgroups/

However, upon looking today I see that the examples are revised.
cgroup is now mounted on /sys/fs/cgroup/
However, it still lacks consensus
concerning mounting subsystems together or separately.
Both ways are still supported.

Mounting subsystems together is less flexible because
certain subsystems can not be used because they
prohibit the movement of a process into different cgroups.
And yet mounting subsystems together is faster to mount
and faster to create, make cgroups, move processes, etc...


&gt;<i> How about /run?
</I>&gt;<i> Since we have it, we might as well use it.
</I>
It is already the designated dumping ground for files created
during sysinit/early booting.
It is not the first place I would go looking for cgroup.
But then as a SA I would first check /proc/mounts
and next check the documentation directory in order
to learn the mount point for cgroup if that decision was mine.

In one file are there two examples using /cgroup as the mount point.


memcg_test.txt: # mount -t cgroup none /cgroup -o cpuset,memory,cpu,devices
memcg_test.txt: # mount -t cgroup none /cgroup -o memory

Maybe those will eventually be revised to /sys/fs/cgroup ?
Similar to the the many other examples?

blkio-controller.txt:   mount -t tmpfs cgroup_root /sys/fs/cgroup
blkio-controller.txt:   mount -t cgroup -o blkio none /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio
blkio-controller.txt:        mount -t cgroup -o blkio none /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio
cgroups.txt: 1) mount -t tmpfs cgroup_root /sys/fs/cgroup
cgroups.txt: 3) mount -t cgroup -ocpuset cpuset /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset
cgroups.txt:  mount -t tmpfs cgroup_root /sys/fs/cgroup
cgroups.txt:  mount -t cgroup cpuset -ocpuset /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset
cgroups.txt:# mount -t cgroup xxx /sys/fs/cgroup
cgroups.txt:# mount -t tmpfs cgroup_root /sys/fs/cgroup
cgroups.txt:# mount -t cgroup -o cpuset,memory hier1 /sys/fs/cgroup/rg1
cgroups.txt:# mount -o remount,cpuset,blkio hier1 /sys/fs/cgroup/rg1
cgroups.txt:# mount -o remount,blkio /sys/fs/cgroup/rg1
cpuacct.txt:# mount -t cgroup -ocpuacct none /sys/fs/cgroup
cpusets.txt: 2) mount -t cgroup -ocpuset cpuset /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset
cpusets.txt:  mount -t cgroup -ocpuset cpuset /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset
cpusets.txt:# mount -t cgroup -o cpuset cpuset /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset
cpusets.txt:mount -t cpuset X /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset
cpusets.txt:mount -t cgroup -ocpuset,noprefix X /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset
freezer-subsystem.txt:   # mount -t cgroup -ofreezer freezer
/sys/fs/cgroup/freezer
memory.txt:# mount -t tmpfs none /sys/fs/cgroup
memory.txt:# mount -t cgroup none /sys/fs/cgroup/memory -o memory


The revised examples in the documentation directory
already provide or hint at what could become inter-distribution consensus.
That is what I wanted.
I anticipated the cgroup mount point moving.
All my programs that use cgroup
have a flexible method for locating the cgroup file system's mount point.
However, they do not support using individual subsystem mounts.
And I am feeling tempted to transition not merely the mount point,
but also to using individual subsystem mounts.

Oh, I should have looked at the documentation directory again
before posting the question to the list.
At least part of the answer was there.
Yet previously, examples showed /dev/cgroup/ as a mount point.
And now /dev/cgroup can not be grepped.

I should mention that learning cgroup is worth the effort.
At first glance cgroup is confusing.
Yet it becomes the new key to unlocking
the control room to resource management.
Not merely can proportion of CPU cycle allocation be controlled,
but also memory, disk I/O, processor affinity, and even the ability
to freeze/pause programs.

The many different methods such as nice, taskset, ulimit
can now be done through cgroup.
And using &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;renice&quot; no longer effects processes.
That scheduler is not used with cgroup.


&gt;<i> I just had a look at /run... it looks nice and populated, seems that
</I>&gt;<i> more and more projects are using it.
</I>
I am merely shoveling files and directories into it.
Most boxes should have symbolic links

$ ls -lah /var/ | grep &quot;lock\|run&quot;
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root     9 Apr 26 14:30 lock -&gt; /run/lock
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root     4 Jul 28 14:15 run -&gt; /run


&gt;&gt;<i> Another question is...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Does anyone use gpm?
</I>&gt;<i> Not me. Seems that almost every input device interferes with xf86-input-evdev
</I>&gt;<i> On a laptop where the attached equipment changes often, evdev is a must.
</I>
Excellent observation.
gmp is ancient, but xf86-input-evdev is new.
Seems reasonable that gpm would not integrate
the input from two or more pointing devices
the way xf86-input-evdev allows for both
a touchpad and a usb mouse to be used concurrently.

Maybe instead of running as a daemon
gpm can be started when a user logs in on a console
and then stopped when logged out?
I am yet uncertain if gpm use
is worth the time to consider and effort to revise.


Thanks for the feedback.
