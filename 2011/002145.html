<PRE>Thanks for reading.
These changes are worth knowing.
I expected much longer to complete this.
However, I am pushing ahead faster than anticipated
in order to be able to roll new I/Rs next week.
Yes, a couple of SAs have requested new I/Rs.
So sorry for the necessary delays.

The changes I am excitedly writing about today
involve booting and shutdown.
Over the years I carefully listen to
SAs' evaluations of booting and shutdown.
I might not implement everything all at once,
but feel assured that I am listening.
For that reason Sorcerer evolves according to SA feedback.
Evolving according to SA feedback
rather than copying other distros
is probably the reason
why Sorcerer has no problem with
providing tmpfs on /var/run and /var/lock
which seems to plague other distros.

Most SAs suggest that init somehow
run faster or becomes interactive.
Those topics have received ample discussion.
Therefore, this time I am trying to solve
the silently grumbled complaints such as:

&quot;Sometimes on reboot / was not cleanly unmounted.&quot;
&quot;Shutdown and reboot scrolls faster than I can read.&quot;
&quot;I want a reboot/shutdown log.&quot;
&quot;I want interactive shutdown.&quot;
&quot;I realize that fast booting works on your computers,
but oddly enough it does not work on mine.&quot;

Maybe those requests come as a surprise.
That is because the most frequently used complaint box
is not the Sorcerer SA's email list,
but instead it is my personal inbox.

Please feel at ease.
The above inquiries, statements, suggestions
will now be answered.
I have some pleasing answers
in regards to those requests.
But first a digression.

Virtual console #7 now runs a getty that allows login to the initramfs.
When logged into the initramfs the real root filesystem is mounted as
/media/root
Therefore, when using virtual console #7 for repairs
the SA enjoys commanding the box
from a comfortable armchair
while sitting safely above the real root filesystem.
Virtual console #7 is intended for SAs
that want to effect immediate repairs
without having to reboot with an Install/Rescue disk
and without having to reboot using the rescue label.

Of course logging into the initramfs
on virtual console #7 is my favorite improvement.
It is like sitting in Captain's Kirk's bridge chair.
Senior level SAs will surely enjoy it.
However, it was never a SA requested item.

Thank me in advance,
because I just deleted at least 10 boring paragraphs
that described the changes and rationale.
And now let us skip ahead
to the far more entertaining evaluation of boons and banes.

Banes:
1. About 60 to 100M of swappable memory
    is consumed in order to retain the initramfs.
2. Support for fast booting is sacrificed.

Boons:
1. Totally clean reboot/shutdown.
2. Near complete log of reboot/shutdown in /var/log/runlevel.{6,0} ,
respectively.
3. Able to pause, review and approve the reboot/shutdown.
4. Able to login before the executing the final command to halt/reboot.
5. Able to view reboot/shutdown logs in /var/log/ on next boot.
6. Able to abort shutdown and rebound box to runlevels 1 through 5.
7. Able to log into the initramfs on virtual console #7
    and receive a bird's eye view of the real root filesystem mounted
on /media/root.
8. Able to switch to runlevel 7 in order to terminate all gettys,
except virtual console #7,
   and therefore be able to manually unmount /media/root

8 boons to 2 banes.
Easy to understand why I implemented these totally worthy changes
without first seeking consensus among Sorcerer SAs, yes?

The tmpfs that was formerly mounted on /etc/init.d/log.d/
is now mounted on /var/log/boot/
I moved it to more easily copy of /etc/init.d/


And now for the FAQ portion:

Q) Will Sorcerer lose the race to become the fastest booting distro?
A) Yes, because sacrificing all for speed is folly.

Q) Is Sorcerer switching to upstart or an alternative to SystemVInit?
A) Gains for other methods are insignificant
    when compared to the sacrifice simplicity,
    and befuddle expectations about
    the order of execution of events during boot.

Q) In addition to Sorcerer multilib will there be a Sorcerer multiroot?
A) An x86_64 Sorcerer multilib installation obsoletes the need
    for having an additional separate Sorcerer IA32 installation.
    However, multiroot Sorcerer could be possible with sufficient consensus.

Q) Must SAs do anything differently to boot, run and shutdown?
A) SAs are not required to do anything differently.
    Boxes upgrade seamlessly to the new improvements.
    SAs that do not read this email will probably wonder
    exactly where in wonderland does virtual console #7 go.


[Warning]   [Warning]   [Warning]

Please be aware that /etc/inittab
will be replaced with a newer inittab.
Even customized /etc/inittab are replaced.
However, the default runlevel for the new /etc/inittab
will be the same as specified in the existing /etc/inittab.

Boxes that do not have properly modified /etc/inittab
will probably have virtual consoles #1 through #6
login to the initramfs wonderland
rather than the real root filesystem
that is mounted on /media/root/
If that is the situation then do not panic.
chroot into /media/root and fix the /etc/inittab
based upon /etc.ori/inittab or the one from
/root/.sorcery/grimoire/sysvinit.d/inittab

Therefore, boxes that have very unique /etc/inittab
will require the attention of the SA in order to
craft a custom compromise.
If getty on virtual 7 is disabled in /etc/inittab
then no virtual consoles will provide a method
for logging into the initramfs.
Some boxes might run on a runlevel
where all virtual consoles are disabled
so that only a GUI login or kiosk is provided.
Those types of boxes will require SA intervention.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Okay that is all I want to say about that.

In a couple of days boxes using the LAG=1
grimoire will be able to receive the updates.
After the first reboot then the
new jaw dropping functionality becomes active.
Enjoy.

If anyone on the LAG=0 grimoire receives the
update tomorrow and discovers a problem
then please email me ASAP.
I have tested it thoroughly in qemu
and on two real computers.
I wanted to hack it into shape using at least a full week.
However, due to requests for new I/Rs
I am deploying the changes in under a week.
Hopefully, the transition will be smooth,
otherwise I really need a vacation.
