<PRE>If make install for lilo or linux runs /sbin/lilo
then it is not showing up in the compile logs.
As far as I know lilo is only run by
/etc/init.d/{initramfs,lilo}
and those are run by /usr/sbin/cast

A way to become certain is to make /sbin/lilo a wrapper
that logs when /sbin/lilo is run
along with the parameters and the outcome.

Another possibility is to check /sbin/lilo's access time
on a file system that has atime enabled.
However, my impression of atime enabled file systems
is that they bring fixed disks to an early demise.
However, that observation might be historic rather than current.
Yet, I still do not risk it.

Evert is interested in knowing when lilo runs.
My interest is in having /sbin/lilo run when
lilo's configuration changes or when
new initramfs images are generated.

SAs that do not want automatic initramfs regeneration
and automatic updating of lilo's configuration file
and automatic running of /sbin/lilo can
# chmod 600 /etc/init.d/{initramfs,lilo}
Then, a SA can be very certain about when lilo runs
and about when initramfs images are generated.
However, as long as automatic mode works fine
then automatic mode should be used.

For SAs still in the habit of doing it manually there is:
/sbin/mkinitrd
/sbin/mkinitrf
SAs who studied LSB would expect those to be present.

However, for SAs that might be confused
about the initramfs yet know about lilo
then the /usr/sbin/lilo wrapper that invokes the scripts required
to update lilo's configuration file and to regenerated initramfs images
should be nothing short of a boon.
Many SAs might not be used to running init-scripts manually
and therefore this helps out.
Perhaps within the LSB there is no mention of a program/script
that should exist for the purpose of automatically updating lilo's
configuration file.
That is I only provided /etc/init.d/lilo
It is not a bad spot for it since it is under 4k
and should be run before shutdown/reboot if not sooner.

Generally, I assume that convenience and automation is best.
However, if the conveniences or automatic execution seems
to be more of a bane than a boon then please voice it as Evert did.
Sometimes a small bit of adjustment can make the implementation better.

Also Evert discovered something that I had not anticipated.
If during cast of sysinit the SA selects nodes for character devices
where the device would be unavailable during boot
then that could cause the execution of sysinit or runlevel
to entirely abort due to a broke pipe.
Unfortunately, I did not anticipate nor checked for this possibility.
Yet, thanks to a report from Evert;
/etc/init.d/{rcS,prc} now check that the character device is available.
If it is not then it tees the output to console and the log file.
Therefore, it should avoid a &quot;device not present&quot; and broken pipe situation.

There are probably other spots in Sorcerer
where I did not anticipate all the possible selections of the SA.
When locating something like that where the SA can break
it by selecting something that seemed appropriate
then please report it as a possible bug.
Spotting and fixing these improves Sorcerer's robustness.

This discussion might seem like overkill for something like
whether or not to have /usr/sbin/lilo and convenience wrappers.
However, if a SA is dissatisfied with something and there is no clear compromise
then discussion on the email list helps impel progress towards improvement.

On the subject of improvements...
The grimoire following the next I/R release will become more congruent
with the labels that software authors are using for their releases.

For example, the first few lines of the rsyslog spell will become:

   version stable 5.6.4 5.6.3 5.4.0
   version devel 6.1.5 6.1.4 6.1.3
   version beta  5.7.8 5.7.6

The software author is not using a release label called &quot;unstable.&quot;
Therefore, trying to conform the software author's releases
to old sorcery requires deciding if version 6.1.5 or version 5.7.8
deserved to be unstable version progress.
In retrospect making sorcery and the grimoire more flexible is the
better solution.
By using the &quot;version&quot; function an arbitrary label can be given to any
sequence of versions.
Therefore, a SA can select the &quot;devel&quot; version progress or
the &quot;beta&quot; version progress for the rsyslog spell.
Arbitrary version progress makes indexing slightly slower,
but it also makes sorcery a better tool for software installation and updating.

Might have been great to have an implementation as flexible as that
from the start.
But sorcery and the grimoire are still evolving to become a better
tool for the task.
And I probably have a bit more revision to go before
I become satisfied with the way arbitrary version progress works.
