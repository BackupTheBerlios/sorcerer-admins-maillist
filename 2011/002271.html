<PRE>gdm uses metacity for it's window manager.
However, something as simple as gdm probably aught not require a window manager.
gdm seems to run, but crashes when using twinview NVIDIA displays.

gnome-session might run
/usr/libexec/gnome-session-check-accelerated
and decide to start a fallback session instead of a regular session.
A regular session uses gnome-shell as the window manager.
gnome-shell uses some libraries provided by mutter,
however otherwise mutter does not appear to be used as a gnome 3.2.0
window manager.
gnome-shell might not render properly, might not render text properly,
might not look anything at all, or might look extremely messed up.
Perhaps it might work, but I have yet to see that.
I only recently was able to make it run without segfaulting.
gjs only works properly when linked with spidermoneky
an older version of mozilla's java script library
rather than the newer xulrunner.
Strange and unexpected.
If gnome-shell works properly
then hurray and enjoy gnome 3.2.0.
The gnome-shell does seem to be their strong selling point or
cancellation point.

If gnome-session begins the fallback session
then the metacity is loaded as the window manager.
This works fine until the first application is run.
At that point metacity might crash
and therefore forcefully logout and end the user's session.
This happens consistently during my tests.
However, maybe there are boxes upon which
metacity does not crash and properly runs?

Although I can make it compile properly and install properly;
I estimate a low probability of making gnome 3.2.0 run properly.
My advise is to enjoy running gnome-apps,
but probably best to launch them from a KDE session.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
gnome authors baffled me also for a couple of days.
The quality is a bit less than I hoped.
Before cursing Sorcerer or
cursing one's box
please remember, it's gnome.
Please try any a different window manager / desktop environment instead.
