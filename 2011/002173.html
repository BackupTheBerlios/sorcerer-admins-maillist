<PRE>sorcery-immune is deprecated.
sorcery-immune was implemented in accordance with SAs' requests.
However, since that time SAs made different requests.
Therefore, I want to introduce the new &quot;immune&quot; profile spell.

immune has 4 optional spells:

immune-sentinel-elf
immune-sentinel-resume
immune-sentinel-space
immune-sentinel-sync

Each spell installs a daemon.
These demons act like sentinels.
Each guards against and reacts to undesirable conditions.
They use an insignificant amount of resources
while potentially providing useful benefits.

sentinel-elf guards /lib64 on x86_64 and /lib on IA32.
If a problem occurs with ELF libraries in those directories
then the sentinel replaces the directory
with a previous good save of the directory.

sentinel-resume defends against stalls, excessively frozen spells.
It enhances the sorcery tools with cron like functionality.

sentinel-space defends against critical shortages of available file
system space.
When possible it compresses documentation directories into tar files.
If absolutely necessary then it removes previously compressed document
directories.
It could also remove locale translations that lack a generated glibc
locales database.
However, it should not remove anything that cause more problems than it solves.

sentinel-sync does a period synchronization of installed software.
Unlike the previous incarnation
sentinel-sync has a configuration file
/etc/init.d/conf.d/sentinel-sync
The command:

# echo DAYS=14 &gt; /etc/init.d/conf.d/sentinel-sync

will cause a box to synchronize every 14 days
instead of the default of 7 days.

As I revise additional spells that contribute to
the smooth operating of a Sorcerer box
then I will probably automatically add them
as immune-* type spells.

immune-sentinel-*  type spells are daemons.
Other types such as
immune-boot-* would probably be something
that runs during boot and then exits.
Each spell that enhances the immune system
will receive an optional in the &quot;immune&quot; profile spell.
The immune system will be expanded based upon what SAs request.

Automatic transition from spell sorcery-immune
to spells immune-sentinel-* is NOT provided.
The new sentinels differ from previously incarnation.
Please test new immune sentinels on dev boxes first
and verify that they perform as the SA wants and expects.

</PRE>
