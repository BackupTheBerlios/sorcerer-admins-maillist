Just so it's on the list:

The standard UNIX authentication method is elegant, simple and easy to
understand.

The only flaw in the model is that software is not perfect, and
nefarious people exploit flaws in daemons to gain access to
files/services that they are not allowed to.

These flaws in the daemons are fixed as they are discovered by the
white hat hackers around the world, and thus no known exploit works on
a fully up to date box.

This is why there are no malware/virii on UNIX machines, and the only
attacks that work are targeted ones.

Sorcerer boxes are some of the most up to date boxes out there, and
you are already plenty in secure running one.

Security services like selinux, grsecurity and even tomoyo are like
trying to catch the horse after it left the barn.

It can be done, but it's both difficult and the wrong way around the problem.


The right way is not to run daemons you don't need, ie reduce your
exposure, and run up to date software that has every known hole fixed.

And make backups often. :)

Lastly, don't put anything on a computer that you don't want exposed
to the world. Every security model is flawed, and will fail.


Of course, when you are forced to expose http or ssh to the real
world, something like tomoyo becomes useful in locking down that
process, and giving you an excuse when your boss asks you why it was
possible for someone to bypass the security on your system and leave
with the crown jewels. Every security model has flaws, and only serves
to slow down a sufficiently determined cracker.

&gt;<i> And I agree with that also.

</I>&gt;<i> and users under oppressive restrictions. &#160;:)
</I>&gt;<i> root/user security is easy to understand.
