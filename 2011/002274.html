<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>gnome seems to acquire a considerable amount of technology
through annexation of other projects.
Yet when compared to KDE;
gnome's technology such as compositing and effects,
is at least a year behind KDE.
gdm previously used compiz for screen effects,
before that used metacity,
now uses gnome-shell,
and that makes it crash on some boxes.
And yet gdm probably should not require a window manager
when it must only display a login dialog.
I would not even care if the dialog was centered on the screen
or not, or split in between two.

I have not used gnome much in the last decade.
The last time I was a serious gnome users
was when gnome was using enlightenment
as the window manager.
That was somewhat interesting.
I like the reflection effect and snow effects and other things it could do.
These days enlightenment is it's own desktop environment.
I would properly prefer to use enlightenment over gnome.
And yet I do not use enlightenment
merely because I tend to run KDE programs.
Running KDE grants the benefit of having a massive amount of KDE and
QT libraries
already cached and loaded into memory.
Hmm, maybe I should make a program that
caches my frequently used libraries?

Anyway, the aspect that I like best about KDE's window manager's compositing
is being able to turn off the compositing.
As we already know compositing uses the 3D chipset of graphics hardware
by having the output of a program treated as an OpenGL texture.
And then the texture is mapped onto the screen which might be a nice
large flat surface
or something cube shaped or whatever is desired for an effect/distortion.
However, the cost of doing compositing is more CPU usage and a hotter
graphics card,
because compositing is slower than using normal 2D accelerated graphics.
Compositing is neat for multi-core CPUs, but not worth enabling on
single core CPUs.
And unfortunately, gnome's gnome-shell does not have an option to
disable compositing.
If it decides that the graphics card lacks sufficient capability
then it falls back to running metacity which probably crashes
when the first application is run.

Being impressed with gnome 3.2.0 is difficult when
it is crashing gdm, crashing metacity,
rendering text improperly with gnome-shell,
and especially when in the previous years KDE already
desensitized me to the eye-candy available through compositing.

I somewhat pine for the old days when window managers could do
some fascinating effects using integer mathematics and 2D acceleration
instead of OpenGL.
The way it is now is somewhat disappointing.
If I could compile gnome-shell with compositing support disabled
then I would want to try that.
I am disappointed with gnome when
after spending 3 days looking for what I did wrong
when it turns out that gnome does not work properly
on neither my newest nor my oldest hardware.
