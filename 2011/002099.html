<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>The definition of a spell has changed again.
And I expect some SAs will become irritated by
the total deprecation of the invocation of functions:
unstable(); secure(); legacy(); stable().
However, this change is not merely for the benefit of a handful of spells.
Such functions are being relinquished in favor of better methods.

To recapitulate the previous email;
arbitrary version progress is specified in a spell
by syntax such as:

version stable 12.3 12.2 12.1
version unstable 13.90 13.89 13.70
version legacy 0.9 0.8
version elephant trunk-2009

The first parameter to the function version() is the label for the
version progress.
What follows are the list of versions in the order of most recent to oldest.
While a bit more verbose than writing invocations to stable and unstable
the change is in favor for allow arbitrary labels for version progress,
such as the label &quot;elephant.&quot;
But if the choice of &quot;elephant&quot; seemed strange
then consider that there exists a release of sylpheed called &quot;claws.&quot;
Perhaps eventually even those spells will be rewritten to the methods
of arbitrary version progress.
That fact demonstrates that strange release labels exist.
And now spells can handle arbitrary version progress labels
such as &quot;claws&quot; and &quot;fangs.&quot;
That much is not new information, but provided in a previous email.
Paragraphs below provide new information.

Some spells have ugly case statements.
Depending on $VERSION
the source() function is invoked differently.
That can be because the stable and developmental source tarballs
significantly differ in their name or because their download directories differ.
Therefore, should not the source() function also work like the
version() function?
Example:

source stable <A HREF="http://elephants-r-us.com/Stable/pachyderm-$VERSION.stable.tar.bz2">http://elephants-r-us.com/Stable/pachyderm-$VERSION.stable.tar.bz2</A>
source unstable
<A HREF="http://elephants-r-us.com/Devel/pachyderm-$VERSION.snapshot.tar.bz2">http://elephants-r-us.com/Devel/pachyderm-$VERSION.snapshot.tar.bz2</A>

Looking good so far?
But must all spells be rewritten to explicitly state the version progress
as the first parameter when invoking source()?
No, that would be too much effort.
source() without a version progress works identical to how it currently works.
Backward compatibility is maintained.
Therefore,

source <A HREF="http://elephants-r-us.com/archive/pachyderm-$VERSION.tar.bz2">http://elephants-r-us.com/archive/pachyderm-$VERSION.tar.bz2</A>

is still valid and works without specifying the version progress.
And also the invocation of source without version progress implies
that the source is valid for all available version progress for the spell.

Useful, yes?

However, the use of conditional syntax
during the information declaration portion of a spell
might also have similar syntax again during the build() function.
That would be the situation when
different releases of the sources
have different build methods.
Therefore, arbitrary version progress can now also be applied
by allowing the spell author to create a spell such as:

version stable 12.3 12.2 12.1
version unstable 13.90 13.89 13.70
...

build_stable(){ ./configure --prefix=/usr ... ;}
build_unstable(){ cmake ... ;}

The use of the new functionality
allows for cleaner looking spells.
Coding a build() function or build_$PROGRESS() style functions
is the prerogative of the spell author.
Therefore, it is still optional
when a custom build() function is not required.

The cost to benefit analysis is nearly an even trade.
The banes of these changes include a slight
increase in the complexity of spell authorship
and a slight increase in the size of spells.
The boons allow for spells to be better adapted to
the what software authors provide for sources.
And the elimination of a some conditional syntax
from spells allows for cleaner looking and easier to read spells.
Given that the counts for banes and boons both equal 2
the change seems to provide a gain
that is commensurate for the pain.

I also want to add that the implementation choice,
which was one of several possible methods,
provides a good compromise between functionality, convenience and complexity.
Spells must still be written such that versions and version progress
must occur prior to invoking source with the $VERSION variable as a parameter.
But that has always been a limitation of spells.
No new limitations were introduced.
Therefore, overall spells are still very similar to how they were last year,
but with a some useful new optional functionality.
