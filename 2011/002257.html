Everywhere I turn, every howto and tutorial I read, and every manual I
write; says to disable selinux before proceeding with anything
- -installing software, configuring this service or that, and even just
plain old basic OS install.

Selinux is a wonderful thing - especially in the RH/CentOS world, coz
you get to turn it off and disable it almost as soon as you assign a
machine its hostname.

Selinux is so popular that it's not included at all in Slackware.

Good call on letting it die on the vine Kyle.

</I>&gt;<i> is not a bad idea.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet finding the best implementation may prove challenging.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I recently began playing with tomoyo.
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to work decently.
</I>&gt;<i> It is include in the vanilla linux kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> It requires no helper libraries like selinux.
</I>&gt;<i> It has a learning mode like grsecurity.
</I>&gt;<i> It lacks a master password like grsecurity has.
</I>&gt;<i> Individual domains can be set to unenforced, learning mode, report
</I>&gt;<i> mode, or enforced mode.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is effective for creating boxes for remote services.
</I>&gt;<i> That way if the security of the remote service is thwarted
</I>&gt;<i> then access to which files can be read, modified, and executed
</I>&gt;<i> can remain limited even if the account has root access.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, a service can be &quot;locked in the box.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> It is a bit like a chroot jail, without the chroot,
</I>&gt;<i> and with the ability to disable the ability to mount a path out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I have in mind differs somewhat.
</I>&gt;<i> Rather than harden the security of individual services
</I>&gt;<i> I would rather erect a diamond wall.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, when not in a permissive domain
</I>&gt;<i> then I prefer that the full illusion of root access
</I>&gt;<i> be given yet with the limitations of not actually
</I>&gt;<i> being able to modify files in /etc /bin /sbin /usr /opt, etc...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A clever Sorcerer SA had a method for this
</I>&gt;<i> by segregating file systems on different mount points
</I>&gt;<i> and remounting them read-only when expected that
</I>&gt;<i> they should not be modified.
</I>&gt;<i> The flaw of this method is the same as security by obscurity.
</I>&gt;<i> The defense is overcome by merely knowing
</I>&gt;<i> that the file system must be remounted read-write.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I digress.
</I>&gt;<i> What I want to explain is that I can probably achieve
</I>&gt;<i> the type of security that I desire with tomoyo.
</I>&gt;<i> It would involve careful implementation of domains
</I>&gt;<i> that have many regular expressions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, does anyone else have a preferred method
</I>&gt;<i> that perhaps unlike tomoyo can be made to enforce
</I>&gt;<i> permissively except where explicitly denied?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimately, what I desire is not only enhanced security
</I>&gt;<i> where all services are properly locked in their boxes,
</I>&gt;<i> but also where gaining full root privilege requires running /bin/sulogin
</I>&gt;<i> That way if effective user ID 0 is awarded by sshd or
</I>&gt;<i> by exploiting a bug in a root owned process
</I>&gt;<i> then full root privilege is not granted until
</I>&gt;<i> we are certain that the user
</I>&gt;<i> has truly authenticated himself with the root password.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does this seem like a good idea?
</I>&gt;<i> Is anyone in the boat with me on this idea?
</I>&gt;<i> I am not saying that we must use tomoyo
</I>&gt;<i> to implement enhanced security.
</I>&gt;<i> But unless someone has a better suggestion
</I>&gt;<i> then tomoyo seems like a method
</I>&gt;<i> that can accomplish the task with a reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> amount of headache and toil.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once enhanced security is implemented
</I>&gt;<i> then nothing will differ from a user's point of view.
</I>&gt;<i> However, gaining root will become slightly more
</I>&gt;<i> annoying since we will be typing
</I>&gt;<i> $ /sbin/sulogin -p
</I>&gt;<i> instead of
</I>&gt;<i> $ su -
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And before anyone asks why not with
</I>&gt;<i> # su -
</I>&gt;<i> the answer is that # su -
</I>&gt;<i> does not prompt for a password
</I>&gt;<i> because the effective user id is already root.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, I want to provide limited default rules
</I>&gt;<i> for services that should operate
</I>&gt;<i> the same on all Sorcerer boxes such as ntp.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, Sorcerer SAs that do not want to learn tomoyo,
</I>&gt;<i> but want to keep the enhanced security
</I>&gt;<i> will only have to learn to type
</I>&gt;<i> # /sbin/sulogin -p
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> $ /sbin/sulogin -p
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, all gain and no pain for lazy Sorcerer SAs.
</I>&gt;<i> And the rest of us will have a reasonable tool for
</I>&gt;<i> locking each process into a form fitting box.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It might not be a perfect solution.
</I>&gt;<i> A user with a rootkit might be able to gain effective root access,
</I>&gt;<i> but without the full privilege of root.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, no change could be made to /etc /sbin /bin /usr /opt
</I>&gt;<i> And perhaps /var and /home can also be protected.
</I>&gt;<i> The unauthorized root would probably be able to
</I>&gt;<i> to run processes as root, perhaps bind to port &lt; 1024,
</I>&gt;<i> and maybe kill other processes.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet hopefully the limit of the damage that could be done
</I>&gt;<i> could be stopped short of allowing any change
</I>&gt;<i> that would survive reboot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The full scope may be difficult to achieve.
</I>&gt;<i> With tomoyo domain transition is achieved
</I>&gt;<i> when a new process is run.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, the controlling domain does
</I>&gt;<i> not have an apparent correlation with the user id.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet this transition based upon user id
</I>&gt;<i> might be an a task that can be accomplished.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet without it an unauthorized root acquired by exploiting
</I>&gt;<i> a bug would probably gain sufficient permission to
</I>&gt;<i> # rm -r /home
</I>&gt;<i> Or sneakily modify/plant certain files
</I>&gt;<i> in someone else's home directory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, that explains the concept of the virtual diamond wall.
</I>&gt;<i> The virtual diamond wall allows the normal level
</I>&gt;<i> of user permission that one would expect.
</I>&gt;<i> However an unauthorized acquisition of root encounters
</I>&gt;<i> a transparent yet impenetrable wall that prohibits file modification
</I>&gt;<i> until explicit authentication with sulogin is achieved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems like an easy concept yet unfortunately is a challenging implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone else like the idea and want for a Sorcerer box that can do that?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> grsecurity can nearly accomplish the diamond wall effect out of box
</I>&gt;<i> by having an uberuser password which one must authenticate with
</I>&gt;<i> before gaining the full privilege of root.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, grsecurity is not part of the vanilla kernel.
