<PRE>Here is the demystification of cast, leech, and dispel.
Dispel is easiest to understanding.
dispel processes all spells in the dispel queue
concurrently without any order.
That helps dispel run quickly.

leech is the nearly as simple as dispel.
leech downloads sources listed in the leech queue
according to the expected cast order of the spells.
The download order is not guaranteed to be ideal.
But usually it should rarely cause
cast to unnecessarily wait for a source.

leech has the ability to invoke cast
provided that cast is not already running
and spells are in the cast queue.

Leech or in general the download of sources is
not very interesting.
Therefore, usually nothing shows in augur scry.
If a source happens to be downloading when
augur scry runs then augur scry might attempt
to show that along with an estimated progress
of the download.

Doing # augur scry $SPELL
might show the output of curl
provided the spell is the leech queue and downloading.

If a SA earnestly wants to know the download order
then this command will provide the information:

# augur queue | sed &quot;s:leech/::p;d&quot; | augur order

Spells listed above download before spells listed beneath.


Similar to leech, cast also uses an ordered list
of spells in the cast queue
for the task of determining which spell should
next be compile or restored.
However, for a spell to be selected by cast
then that spell must not be downloading
and not have any of it's possible requirements
currently casting.
Additionally, some spells are solo spells
and therefore can be the only spell casting.
Often a solo spell might delay before starting
until it becomes required by every other
spell waiting to cast.

The added complexity to the selection of spells
to cast grants cast optimal probability that
a spell should successfully finish compilation
linking and installation without encountering
an error created by concurrently casting with
another spell.

The screen for
# augur scry
gives a hint about the future.
Spells listed from top to bottom have
a somewhat chronological order.
The first few lines might indicate spells
that are queued for compilation and expected
to begin soon.
Lines that show spells that are currently compiling
occur after the lines that indicate the expected future.
Those lines look somewhat different.
Finally, the lines that follow each begin
with an event classification such as
&quot;Pass Cast&quot;
Those indicate events that recently happened.
Older events occur lower and the oldest of events
eventually lose their place on the list.
However, the list will usually still contain at the bottom
a line for the last event where something failed.

I like to consider the layout of # augur scry
similar to that of an aircraft HUD, head's up display.
A HUD displays information but does not waste
space presenting a key that explains which is the
altimeter, airspeed, and attitude indicators.
Yet after one looks at the HUD for a moment during flight
then it seems to make sense.

Similarly,
# augur scry $SPELL
is as if the pilot quit looking ahead and instead
looked down at an gauge or multi-function-display
in order to receive precise information.
The HUD might not indicate a fire exists in engine 2,
but the MFD, multi-function-display,
can display fuel, damage, hydraulic pressure, etc...

sorcery is like fly-by-wire.
The yoke is not directly physically connected
to the aileron and elevators flight control surfaces.
Therefore, the pilot pushes on the stick
and the fancy stuff happens in the background
without the pilot exactly knowing how the avionics
computer and hydraulic systems work nor
what they are doing.
In that respect SAs really are like modern aircraft
pilots flying their boxes from the past to the present
and into the future.

Having sorcery tools perform like
fly-by-wire avionics is not a bad thing.
Otherwise SAs could become overwhelmed by the
choices per second required to make an update happen
if the SA had to manually select spell order and,
manually compile, install, track, and remove software.

Also Sorcerer boxes can have installed libraries
change their &quot;shared object&quot; name follow an update.
That type of event makes a box as unstable as a F16.
To avoid having a box roll violently out of control
and crash into the ground
sorcery checks for these &quot;Miss ELF&quot; events.
After discovering problems
then it adds to the cast queues the spells
which must be recompiled and relinked
with the newer libraries that were recently installed.

Yes, the aircraft analogies break with the
tradition of the magic analogies.
However, the initial conception of idea
differs greatly from currently implementation.
sorcery rough draft was merely a technology demonstration
a proof that the concept can be implemented.
Unfortunately, it was far from usable.
Modern sorcery expects and adapts to the changes in a box.
Almost every bit of the complexity in it serves a purpose.

Unless someone suggests a better idea
then the SA should load queues, begin the action
and watch it unfold using # augur scry.
Unlike flying an airplane there is no roar of engines,
no hiss of the slipstream, and no scenery and clouds
to view through a glass cockpit.
The landscape of files and directories
that the sorcery tools flies through lacks
an abstracted graphic/visual representation.
Yet sorcery is a means for flying through
the digital landscape of free software.

For those that like an abstract visualization
there is a program called lavaps.
It uses information that a program such as top would gather
and then displays it in an analog form
with a visual representation similar to a lava lamp.

Probably people can feel bewildered by computers
especially after they decide that there are no suitable
analogies to physical constructs.
In order to delay that onset some operating systems
transitioned the name of &quot;directory&quot; to &quot;folder.&quot;
But changing the name does not change what it is
and &quot;folder&quot; is no more nor less accurate description.
It is entirely abstract and mysterious
to those who do not know what it really is.

Therefore, my suggestion is to not allow a problem
assume the appearance of a battle of will between
man and machine.
The sorcery tools are trying to do what it can in order
to fulfill the SA requests.
So instead consider it something like a junior SA
that occasionally requires a little bit of extra assistance.
Generally, it does the proper thing and
it does so with greater ease and far faster than
a human SA could do manually.

To see what transpired in the last 24 hours
try the command:

# augur event 1

The event logs are often a good method
for discovering what happened.
And at the end it will provide the accumulated
occurrences for events such as:

Event Type  Occurrences
Cast ELF    2
Cast LA     2
Cast MD5    2
Cast New    80
Cast Req    22
Cast SA     3
Fail Auto   16
Fail Load   2
Miss ELF    3
Miss LA     2
Pass Cast   132
Pass Load   110
Pass Oust   112
Pass Void   2

Any SA that wants to come closer to the action
is probably typing:

../configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install DESTDIR=$PWD/install

or something like that on a command line.
