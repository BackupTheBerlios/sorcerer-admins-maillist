<PRE>Good conjecture.

Originally,
# augur update
# augur begin
differed only slightly.

# augur newer
previously queued spells with future time stamps.
Consequently,
# augur update
re-queue spells with current time stamps.
Because, only spells with current
and past time stamps will cast.

Now
# augur update
# augur begin
are identical.
Why keep both?

My ideas do not include future plans for revising
# augur update
However, &quot;update&quot; could be a potentially useful word
for an augur command.
However, without sufficient context
the function of the command could be misconstrued.

However, in retrospect maybe I should have retired
# augur sync
and kept
# augur update
as the command for updating all installed software?
It makes better sense that way.
Ideally, I should have slated both to be deprecated
and introduced a new word,
other than &quot;easy, sync and update.&quot;
Hmm, no better word comes to mind
for the action of updating installed software
than &quot;update.&quot;
However, the idea of sync or synchronization is not
far from the mark because the versions of software
to be updated are synchronized to Sorcerer grimoire.

Although synchronization, or sync for short,
is conceptually different than &quot;update&quot;
it is more descriptive of what happens.
Installed software synchronizes to the versions
specified in the grimoire rather than necessarily
selecting newer versions that the software author is providing.
So I suppose I will stay with sync.
While it is a bit more difficult to spot than &quot;update;&quot;
it is also 2 key presses less to type.

In general the fewer augur commands
that begin with the same letter
then the better tab completion works.

Many separate yet related augur commands
are now grouped together.
For example, most of the log related augur functions
are now invoked in two parts such as

# augur log install bash
instead of typing
# augur install bash

The grouping of similar augur commands
into sub-commands of a single augur command
not only improves tab completion
but gathers the similar functions together
where the SA can learn about them together by typing:

# augur help log

Obviously, the logical grouping of augur commands
still requires more effort.
And some of the existing commands could be improved
and/or bug fixed.

As a tradeoff I sometimes add frequently used commands
to the &quot;a&quot; alias.

# augur help a

Root's environment contains three aliases:

&quot;au&quot;  invokes augur.
&quot;aug&quot; invokes augur.
&quot;a&quot; is a convenience wrapper for augur.

Examples:

# a c $SPELL    augur begin $SPELL; augur scry $SPELL
# a d $SPELL    augur queue dispel/$SPELL; dispel
# a l $SPELL    augur queue leech/$SPELL; leech
# a r           moves spells from fail to cast queue then runs # augur begin
# a t $SPELL    augur begin $SPELL; augur check $SPELL


Deprecating old methods and aggregating
similar augur commands
does not necessarily come at the cost
of a loss of convenience.

SAs that enjoyed the traditional
# cast $SPELL
that started a spell casting
and provided a complimentary
# augur scry $SPELL
can now type instead
# a c $SPELL
With some practice
turning on the a c is not only cooler,
but also faster to type than typing cast,
because it is overall one character shorter in length.
:<i>)
</I>
aggregating similar augur commands
not only increases logic and
helps clarify understanding for SAs.
It also helps simplify and expedite
checking, maintaining, updating,
and improving those command modules.
If I were making some change/improvement
that has bearing on
aron, iron, aarof, arofni, elfof, etc...
then the only file to edit is
/usr/libexec/sorcery/augur.d/req
instead of 6 or 7 different files
where I might miss or forget to
adjust one or more of the files.

When I make changes to augur commands
the reasons are usually issues such as:
simplicity, functionality, performance,
SA understanding, editing efficiency,
improvement, etc...

Any of those changes requires effort and testing.
The most recent improvements to allow grimoire
to link to sorcery and also link
the update of all installed software
required around 6 hours to debug.
Therefore, my evaluation table required sufficient
gains in order to justify the expenditure.

Occasionally, such as now,
I implemented improvements without hesitation.
In contrast, I often post lengthy emails
that documentation the gains and
provide an evaluation comparing
what is lost and what is gained.
In this situation a slight amount of
backwards compatibility is lost.

Experienced SAs can still do updates
however they want.
# augur begin grimoire

The above command only updates
the installed grimoire and sorcery.
Afterward the SA can follow with
# augur newer
# augur queue
# augur begin
# augur scry
etc...

Hopefully, new SAs will not be confused
by the one and only
# augur sync
command.

# augur newer
I have no complaints about.
While it might confuse new SAs
obviously it can not be removed.
There must still be a method for newer spells
to be queued without necessarily having them
automatically cast.

So merely from SAs' point of view
this change seems trivial and superficial.
But in actuality I changed many things
that will allow Sorcerer boxes to update
more smoothly.

And I because I changed the function of
# augur sync
and intend to deprecate and remove
# augur update
# augur easy
in 6 months
I must announce this change on the email list.
Overall the warning is not unreasonable
even if I failed to explain the rationale
for making this change.

Making such changes is not easy,
because like all Sorcerer SAs,
I want augur to remain a consistent
interface to sorcery.
But in another respect it must not be chiseled in stone,
because then augur would cease to improve.

Eventually, software authors implement changes
that break backward compatibility or change the API.
With comparison to the norm
augur seem to change slower
than the face of a mountain.
So I want to say that the inconvenience is minimal
especially when compared to the added benefits.
As an example I submit that nearly half of
available augur commands support accepting
input piped on stdin.
In contrast many older versions of augur
had no commands that accepted input from stdin.
And there was even a time before the cute,
convenient, and customizable modular augur implementation.
Back then augur looked like first class Italian spaghetti code.

Only with sufficient retrospection
can we reach the epiphany where we think,
&quot;glad to be using what we have now
instead of what we used 2 or 3 years ago.&quot;
So pleased pardon the dust
when augur is under reconstruction.
