<PRE>I finally squished enough bugs and released a new Sorcerer
Install/Rescue ISO9660.
One of the more interesting aspects about this CD was my response
to someone telling me that he was unable to log in as root with an
empty password.
Consequently, this I/R presents constant dialog menus.
While login on virtual consoles remains possible,
the default virtual console receives an automatic root login
and greets the person at the console with a menu.
The menu gives the options of doing:
the dialog tutorial;
Sorcerer Sentient Installation;
Sorcerer Modern Magic Installation.

Not many have tried Sorcerer Sentient.
It asks a few questions such as:
user name; password; root password; boot password.
Then it begins an automatic installation on the selected device.

The concept of of the operating system and administration
completely differs with Sorcerer Sentient
although the sorcery tools are still available.
It is almost like a different operating system,
although it uses an older grimoire than
Sorcerer Modern Magic.

Sorcerer Sentient provides a decent default load out
of software for a KDE workstation.
The box automatically updates the installed software periodically.
Not much to say.
Perhaps less to learn.

Sorcerer Modern Magic is the distribution we have used for years,
yet continues improving.
There is often too much to say about it and too much to learn.
But then again the challenge makes SA duties interesting.

Due to the above changes I envision a new homepage where
the visitor is presented with a little bit of information about each
and then selects whether to visit the section that contains information
about &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; or to visit the section about &quot;Sorcerer Modern Magic.&quot;
This way users that are only familiar with &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot;
will not be befuddled by the information provided about &quot;Sorcerer Modern Magic.&quot;
Does anyone want to do the website revision?

A few paragraphs of description,
a few useful screen shots,
a nice looking motif
is basically the aim.
As usual there is not much documentation about Sorcerer
to provide on the website which is current.
And augur has help screens for SAs to learn the commands.

Auditing of the grimoire stalled long ago.
But the delay was worth the gain of &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot;
And eventually, I will continue the audit.
Then the information contained in the grimoire index
can be provided on the website to provide an awesome
page of potentially useful hyperlinks to the documentation
and websites of software projects that can be easily installed
on a Sorcerer box.
Basically, documentation is outsourced to the people
who know the software best and already wrote the docs.

Okay, who is eager to help?
It is not difficult.
All that is required is: time; modern computer; gimp; nano; and
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40-970708/contents.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40-970708/contents.html</A>

I will probably just do the changes myself eventually.
But people who want to participate are invited to have a try at it.
