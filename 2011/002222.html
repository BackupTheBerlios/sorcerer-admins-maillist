<PRE>Thanks for opening the discussion.
It began with an email from Evert requesting
that I remove the -O3 from the compilation of binutils.
CFLAGS CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS that are specified
in a spell's declaration section only have effect when
a spell is not assigned a cpref file.
And of course the less than 20 spells that use -O3 I test.
However, I do not test -O3 on all architectures.

-O3 makes compilation require longer.
-O3 might expedite execution of code.
Therefore, the only benefit of using -O3
is for compilation of software projects
where their process runs a CPU core at full bore
for more than a second.
If sustained full load is not achieved for more than a second
then there is next to no benefit for using -O3
when the optimization risks bugs and requires longer.

Consequently compression programs, bash, MesaLib,
ffmpeg and some software that is expected to be CPU intensive
or to be competing with other processes for the CPU
are compiled with -O3 in order to give Sorcerer a slight
edge in performance without a significant deficit in compile time.
It is just enough additional optimization provided for software
that I hope will deter SAs that are eager to try compiling
their box with -O3 everything and other unsafe gcc optimizations.

In the past I have had SAs compile boxes with -O3 and
2 other unsafe gcc optimizations and then tell me how
terrible Sorcerer is because everything segfaults and crashes.
Yet unlike them I do not dive into waters of uncertain depth,
yet instead carefully check the compilation and runtime performance
of each spell compiled with -O3.
I am not implying &quot;leave the optimization choice to me,&quot;
but rather that I will test optimization more so than a typical Sorcerer SA.
However, I can make mistakes because I do not test on all architectures.

Consequently, if we see segfaulting in binutils and suspect -O3
then we should report what software segfaulted during compilation.
and on what architecture with what version of binutils and gcc.
That way we can gain more certainty of where the problem exists.
If a problem is distribution wide
then I can adjust the spell so that all installed versions of binutils
are recompiled as necessary without -O3 optimization.

Because I do not know if the problem with binutils
is caused by -O3 optimization nor if the problem is distribution wide
I merely removed the -O3 from the CFLAGS for binutils
so that it will use sorcerer default optimizations or
the SA's assigned cpref file.

It is worth saying that the runtime errors that
I have seen that involve optimization tend not to be random.
Some software partially works, especially if the problem exists in a library.
However, where -O3 did not work involving compression programs
then the program failed every time it was run.

Therefore, I would suggest that if the problem happens twice
or is entirely repeatable then try without unsafe optimization
and see if the problem disappears.
If the problem only happens once
then it might not be caused by compilation time optimization.
There is a surprising amount of complexity and interaction
with software and hardware.
Potentially, even a problem reading from disk, memory, swap,
or latency might cause a random error.
Compiling 1000 software projects on a fit box still
has a slim probability of encountering 1 random non-repeatable error.
That is also the reason for immune-sentinel-retry.
It can retry a failed spell after a certain interval
and can be made to retry more than once if the SA wants.

Sorry for being overly verbose.
What I want to know is...
Is ld segfaulting on other boxes?
I am not encountering a problem with ld compiled with -O3.
Thus far we only have Evert's report.
With more information we can decide if binutils
should be recompiled -O2 distribution wide,
be left as it is, or have -O3 optimization restored to the spell.

I have no problem leaving binutils without -O3 optimization.
However, SAs might be surprised by how much CPU cycles
binutils uses during updates.
Even when ccache may defer some of the cost of compilation
all object files must still be linked or stuffed into ar archives.

&gt;<i> Hi there, Sorcerer Admins.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is something of an old debate, but I do have a few thoughts on
</I>&gt;<i> the subject, and would like to hear what other Sorcerer admins think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recently discovered that binutils was compiled with -O3, and created
</I>&gt;<i> an ld that was segfaulting on my hardware.
</I>&gt;<i> I forced it to -O2, and recompiled. ld no longer segfaults on my arch.
</I>&gt;<i> ( Intel Centrino2 )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I first started using Sorcerer, there were no CFLAGS in spells,
</I>&gt;<i> and whatever the SA decided to compile for was accepted. Being young
</I>&gt;<i> and on a slow machine, I compiled an entire system with -O3. --- And
</I>&gt;<i> was sorry I did. Not only did it take much longer to compile, it was
</I>&gt;<i> also horribly broke.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After reading quite a bit on the subject, and quite a few days
</I>&gt;<i> experimenting, me default is &#160;-O2 since -O2 is what most binary
</I>&gt;<i> compiled software is shipped with. As such is by far the most tested
</I>&gt;<i> configuration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer's default -Os only makes a difference on ancient hardware
</I>&gt;<i> which has tiny cache and slow memory bandwitdh. On a modern machine I
</I>&gt;<i> can't tell the difference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -O3 is used very rarely, because speed gains are not universal and
</I>&gt;<i> have to be measured on a case by case basis. Whatever speed gains are
</I>&gt;<i> achieved are offset against possible instabilities that this
</I>&gt;<i> optimization level may cause. A few notable exceptions are ffmpeg, and
</I>&gt;<i> Mesalib, for which the authors recommend -O3 for their sources, and
</I>&gt;<i> thus get a bit of testing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, it is my position that a distribution should not apply -O3 to it's
</I>&gt;<i> core utilities, like we are doing in bash and binutils. While this may
</I>&gt;<i> work on some architectures, it may be unstable on others, and we
</I>&gt;<i> should aim for stability rather than speed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer already has a tool for specifying special CFLAGS for specific spells.
</I>&gt;<i> The way I think it should work is as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An SA like Kyle, that spends the majority of his time in bash, might
</I>&gt;<i> want to test bash with -O3. If it's stable enough, create a
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/sorcery/cpref file where -O3 is applied.
</I>&gt;<i> augur cpref $SPELL $CONF_FILE_NAME would then only apply -O3 for that spell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another SA might want to do it with mysql to squeeze a little more out
</I>&gt;<i> of the hardware available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I use a lot of video stuff, so I would compile my video utilities with
</I>&gt;<i> -O3, and leave the rest of my boxen as stable as possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the end, I suppose it boils down to this....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a control freak Sorcerer SA, I want to have control over what
</I>&gt;<i> compiler flags my sources get compiled with. But I am also lazy, and
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to be over-riding all CFLAGS everywhere, as some spells
</I>&gt;<i> actually only compile with very specific compiler flags. Specifically,
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to be overriding a spell's CFLAGS to make my box more
</I>&gt;<i> stable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The CFLAGS in the spells then override the CFLAGS I specify in
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/cpref/default, as they should. Putting CFLAGS in spells are
</I>&gt;<i> useful when a spell is unstable/uncompilable with safe options, or
</I>&gt;<i> have very specific CFLAG requirements.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lately I have seen -O3 cropping up in the grimoire more and more
</I>&gt;<i> often, and I feel that this is a practice that needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> discouraged, as it may make some architectures unstable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Putting -O3 on spells should be done by the SA for spells on his own
</I>&gt;<i> system only, the only exceptions being sources where the source
</I>&gt;<i> authors actually specify -O3.
</I>&gt;<i> An SA that then want's to mess with a spell's CFLAGS can do so through
</I>&gt;<i> augur cpref, for his own box, but can't blame the distribution for any
</I>&gt;<i> instability that it causes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I feel that even though Sorcerer is a sources-based distribution, I
</I>&gt;<i> would rather that Sorcerer be known for rock solid stability and ease
</I>&gt;<i> of maintenance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anybody have a different view?
