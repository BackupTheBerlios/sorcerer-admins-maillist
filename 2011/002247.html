<PRE>I accomplished doc like improvements.
But who wants to re-invent the wheel?
So instead of a manual page
I created a tutorial for augur.

A tutorial is considerably different
from a manual page.
However, a SA can gain
considerable help by running
# augur help
followed by a valid augur parameter.
Yet the problem may be that
SAs are seeing too many
potential parameters on augur's help screen.
Therefore, I created a solution with this in mind.

I decided to spare all existing SAs
from having to complete the tutorial.
However, boxes installed using Sorcerer Sentient
will be configured so that the person
with access to the root account
must complete the tutorial
in order to gain SA skill levels.
Current levels are:

Sentient
Awakened
Novice
Journeyman
Master
Guru

Likewise tutorials exist for each level.
Tutorials are accessed by
# augur Tutorial

Completing a tutorial level can change the commands
displayed on augur's help screen.
Therefore, fewer commands are displayed at lower levels.
The commands displayed for lower levels are commensurate
with what the SA is expected to be able to train and accomplish.

The tutorials offer suggested reading and tasks.
Finally a short quiz is offered.
Flawless success on the quiz
provides an opportunity for promotion to the next level.

My expectation is that augur's tutorials offer
the extremely short course in how to become a SA.
It is not true computer based training.
It only suggests where to acquire information.
Whether the person trains
is not the problem of Sorcerer development.

A person who complains about Sorcerer lacking docs
is actually a person complaining about their lack of SA skills.
They should not expect a distribution
to teach them how to be a SA.
Hopefully, the augur tutorials
will steer those individuals in a prosperous direction.
They should quickly discover the documentation that exists
exceeds their available reading time for the next decade.

The tutorials appear in sorcery version avp-20110809-0
For now the SAs skill level does not effect
the menus displayed in /usr/sbin/sorcery.
And a SA skill level
does not prohibit the use of augur commands.
It only filters what is displayed when
augur is run without parameters.

I realize that existing Sorcerer SAs
may not be thrilled about augur tutorials.
However, I tried to make some amusing
quiz questions and distraction answers.
Anyone who wants a quick skills check
or wants to improve what is suggested
for reading and assignments should
try the tutorial and provide feedback.

Everything about the tutorials
remains arbitrary at this point
and possible to change.
As we know the level names are as much nonsense
as the colors, kyu, and dan ranks in martial arts.
In the real world there is only those
&quot;who can do&quot; and those who &quot;who can't do.&quot;
And no cut of cloth or piece of paper makes that decision.

Since I will not be gaining income from Sorcerer SA level testing
I am not creating a system of 20 to 30+ levels
which seems popular in martial arts these days.
However, we should try to make the tutorials
reasonably fun and informative.
Please keep that in focus to avoid becoming
absurd with this SA level nonsense
while honing the tutorials.

With merely a few levels
we may yet be able to retain an idea
of the knowledge expected from SAs at each level.
This way someone asking for assistance
might also provide their Sorcerer SA level.
&gt;<i>From that information we can eliminate
</I>from consideration certain problems
and provide suggested solutions and
troubleshooting instructions at a level that the SA
should be able to understand and implement.
