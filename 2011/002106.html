Hmm.... that is an interesting idea.
I can appreciate the logic of keeping the kernel
that is already tested and the most recent 3 newer kernels.
That alone however might not allow a box to survive reboot.
initramfs are regenerated as required and lilo is reinstalled
whenever initramfs are regenerated.
Therefore, if a problem exist
with the initramfs or lilo's install location
then the problem will persist.
There are some file systems, maybe xfs was one of them,
where lilo can not be installed to the boot block.
Installing lilo to the boot block of a file system that does
not have a boot block usually causes corruption that
can be severe.

&gt;&gt;<i> That way when the box boots it first runs ms-sys
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then ms-sys loads and runs the boot block of the first partition with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the bootable flag.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That should cause lilo to run.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And lilo should load the initramfs and kernel image.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> unelss the initramfs failed :)
</I>
lilo will load the blocks that are expected to contain
the initramfs and the linux kernel.
Then lilo starts execution of linux.
Since locations of kernels on disk change less frequently
than the location of an initramfs
there is a higher probability that the installed lilo's mapping
for the kernel is correct.
Then after the kernel begins one would see where the kernel
unpacks the initramfs which happens very quickly except
on the I/R where it is compressed.
Then the kernel tries to mount it.
At that point if the initramfs is not actually an initramfs
then the kernel will complain and booting will halt.

If booting proceeds then /init on the initramfs is running.
This is usually a good sign.
Even if something does go wrong
if the kernel and initramfs are loaded
then the SA can usually fix the problem
without having to boot using an I/R.
If something goes unexpected while /init runs
then that might indicate a problem with the init-scripts
that run or should have run but did not.

&gt;<i> But really; why should it keep versions of the kernel that haven't
</I>&gt;<i> been booted? &#160;and really the current should be kept laways in addtion
</I>&gt;<i> to the 4 (or reduce that to 2 prior to the current, the current and 1
</I>&gt;<i> new &#160;(total of 4)... )
</I>
The choice of keeping the 4 most recently installed kernels
was mostly due to the consideration of keeping the disk
space usage of /boot within expected limitations.
If each initramfs + kernel is about 100M
then 4 of them could fit within a 512M /boot
Maybe no one knows if legacy 512M /boot
partitions are still usable.
Due to potential changes in the future I decided
the recommended size of /boot should be 2G.
This helps deter fragmentation while also allowing
the possibility of the SA creating a swap file on /boot
when temporarily necessary.

The reason for keeping multiple kernels instead
of merely one or two kernels
is due to the expectation that sometimes a kernel
might have instability due to bugs.
Some SAs might want to sit on a kernel for a couple of years,
but even after a year software such as coreutils will
gain requirements on features available in a recent kernel.
So generally, we must push forward with using newer kernels
or painfully encounter unexpected breaks.
Stability is not achieved by standing still,
but rather by trying to discover what still works properly.

However, I like the idea of keeping the 3 newer kernels
plus the kernel that is currently booted.
Thanks for the suggestion.


P.S. about RAM.

A linux kernel requires about 2.1x
as much RAM as the size of the initramfs in order to boot.
And it requires a bit more if the initramfs image is compressed.
So the theoretical lower RAM
limit for booting Sorcerer under 256M.
However, deploying a Sorcerer box with less than 1G of RAM
would probably show undesirable performance even when
/usr/src/sorcery/ is not tmpfs.

More recently, I have discovered that installed RAM should
scale linearly with installed processors in order to achieve
good results.
So 2G is probably adequate on a 2 core SMP.
4G seems to run fine on a 4 core SMP.
Some SAs might still use 8G or more.

My opinion is that buying more RAM
is not necessarily a waste of money,
but rather an investment in disk longevity,
although some SA might disagree about that.
There also exists some debate about using tmpfs on /usr/src/sorcery/

I still recommend using tmpfs on /usr/src/sorcery/ when
compiling optimized code without debug information.
Yet, from what I have observed I feel safe to conjecture that
Sorcerer runs awesomely on any ia32 or x86_64 with
1 to 4 cores provided the box has sufficient installed RAM.

However, we will be seeing in the near future much higher than
expected loadavg when compiling multilib libraries on a 4 core
SMP x86_64 multilib Sorcerer box.
Doing so makes a significant expenditure of RAM.
However, recent changes to the linux kernel allows
nice to treat entire sessions of processes as a single process.
Therefore, when allocating CPU cycles with respect to nice
each spell that casts is given an allocation of cycles as if
all it's processes were merely a single process.
So to put it in plain English
a Sorcerer box is still very responsive and performance ready
even while under a high load during updates.

However, for SAs that absolute want it
the newer sorcery will have a &quot;min&quot; feature
that minimizes the amount of resources that cast can use.

There will be more posts about newer sorcery in the near future,
because it will soon transition from devel to stable.
