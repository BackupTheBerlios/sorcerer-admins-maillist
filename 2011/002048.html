</I>
250M or more for KDE seems a bit much.
Maybe it is a bit much for an Install/Rescue CD?
Still it was worth a moment of consideration.


&gt;<i> I like the minimalistic approach, and admittedly, I like having an
</I>&gt;<i> *option* of stuffing a window manager/GUI in there real quick upon
</I>&gt;<i> installation too - but that might mean that we're heading down a road
</I>&gt;<i> where Sorcerer becomes mired in the mediocrity that results from being
</I>&gt;<i> just another binary distro like all the others...
</I>
Even the initial installation of Sorcerer to install the software required
in order to boot, download, network, and compile is very much like a
a pre-compiled binary based distro until a SA starts using cast to
download, compile, and install sources.
So adding a few more pre-installed software projects to the I/R
alone does not push it any further towards becoming
a pre-compiled binary based distro than it already is.


&gt;<i> Okay Kyle, I'm on the fence here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like the minimalistic approach, and then considering that everything
</I>&gt;<i> gets compiled and installed with whatever I'm wanting - that is good
</I>&gt;<i> (Including XFCE, Gnome, or KDE).
</I>
Well, the new X11R7.6 is available now
and I am testing the spells.
So this is a fine time to try to exclude it from the I/R.
But even if I can keep it off of this Install/Rescue CD
it might yet again appear in the future.
The fact that a pre-installed subversion is no longer included on the I/R
greatly helped the situation with being able to remove
all the X11R7 attribute spells from the I/R


&gt;<i> I personally don't see any value added or reason for VLC, however - that
</I>&gt;<i> smacks of *workstation* to me, and although Sorcerer is a fine
</I>&gt;<i> workstation (if that's how you build it), I would expect that to be left
</I>&gt;<i> up to me as an SA.
</I>
Well, if there is no X11R7 there is no VLC, xine or any video player.


&gt;<i> Yeah, I see no utility in VLC.
</I>
Well if Sorcerer CD came with mpeg4 or mkv video installation instructions
then Xorg + window manager + vlc would be a good choice for viewing them.
The only person I know good with video is Evert.
But I never mentioned the idea previously.
Even with a minimal resolution and high compression;
video showing someone going through the menu driven installer
could consume a couple hundred megabytes probably.
But seeing is believing for the befuddled SAs.

Probably the Sorcerer I/R might not be the best place for such videos?
Maybe youtube?
At least that defers the hosting cost of such a thing?


&gt;<i> KDE, however, (gosh, I am SOOOOooo on the fence about this) might be
</I>&gt;<i> good - as you mention below, we could migrate toward a distro that has a
</I>&gt;<i> quick install w/say, KDE as an *option*, along with a Graphical UI
</I>&gt;<i> installer too - or, the SA could decide NOT to install that or use a
</I>&gt;<i> Graphical UI installer and go the traditional route (which *should not*
</I>&gt;<i> IMO, be removed as the primary method.
</I>
Even on a modern box QT + KDE requires a few hours to compile.
But it is weighing an extra 250 megabytes of download verse an
extra 2.5 hours of compilation.
I suppose those who can not stand the wait can either go with
a pre-compiled binary based distro or use zero-install-injector?


&gt;<i> I would like to know that even doing the installation of a binary
</I>&gt;<i> package for KDE, for example, doesn't preclude us from doing things just
</I>&gt;<i> as before, or being removed later.
</I>
It is always so.
The I/R currently comes with plenty of pre-installed software
that a SA might not want to keep installed.
There is no requirement to keep all of it installed.
parted for example is a program I never use.
I use fdisk to partition devices.


&gt;<i> I also like the notion, like DragonFlyBSD does it, of having *two* &#160;I/R
</I>&gt;<i> disks - one that is the minimalistic and like we're used to, and one
</I>&gt;<i> that includes the GUI [option], which can still be treated as the
</I>&gt;<i> standard minimalistic I/R.
</I>
I had thought about that.
Even before then I thought about a separate no SMP no PAE i686 I/R.
But when it comes down to the effort involved
I do not want to make more than one I/R per architecture.

&gt;<i> I would have to disagree a bit with you here Kyle. I think it's the
</I>&gt;<i> installer. It's really not intuitive, and takes a few runs to begin to
</I>&gt;<i> get the hang of it
</I>
Hardly, anyone agrees on the menu driven installer.
Evert asks for me to change it around about every other year.


&gt;<i> Not only that, but the lack of documentation to show
</I>&gt;<i> what is going on during the install and what to do immediately
</I>&gt;<i> thereafter - Documentation, that I've been working on a bit here and
</I>&gt;<i> there when I am able.
</I>
Evert might have some documentation concerning the menu driven installer.
The items on the main menu are listed top to bottom in basically the correct
order for a SA to select.
A SA without some idea of how to install a distribution probably would not
want to start with Sorcerer.
Obviously, the Sorcerer menu driven installer
explains nothing about what partitioning a device does
nor what LVM does or anything else.
But the SA is free to read the manual pages and documentation
for those that are already installed into the initramfs.

As a compromise to avoid having to read 40 pages of documentation
in order to begin to gain a grasp of the sequences required in order to install
I added to the installer a novice and expert mode.
The novice mode has fewer items on the menu to select.
The novice mode of the menu driven installer
can not do as many types of installations as the expert mode can.
But there is a higher probability that a novice
will be able to accomplish an installation using the novice mode.

The menu driven installer in expert mode probably does not
provide even half the types of installations that are possible
as compared to a skilled SA doing a manual installation from the command line.
But the menu driven installer is a compromise between convenience,
complexity, possibilities.
It is not too easy, nor too complex, nor provide too many possibilities.
It seems to me to be a favorable mix.

I am uncertain about how it is not intuitive.
If I do a manual installation then I tend to use
the same steps and sequence as I would using the menu driven installer.


&gt;<i> I believe that is the main obstacle.
</I>
The installation still remains a bit of a skill check for SAs,
but at least it is far from having to create a usable linux configuration file.


&gt;<i> Take SAMBA, for example, SWAT is kinda kewl for some things, but I would
</I>&gt;<i> certainly not use it to configure my smb.conf - but then again, SWAT is
</I>&gt;<i> http via stunnel - it's not a gui in the sense we're talking about here.
</I>
Yes, the menu driven installer could be made to be web browser based.
Doing so is quite a thick undertaking.
And it is probably easier to accomplish with a webserver running CGI
rather than writing a BASH script or program to emulate a web server
on a local port.


&gt;<i> Nor does there need to be, IMO. Two versions of the I/R might serve well
</I>&gt;<i> for [what I call] the *point-n-clickers* out there, who want to try
</I>&gt;<i> something new and need a mouse to get there by guessing.
</I>
Sorry, I am too lazy to do 4 I/Rs for 2 architectures.


&gt;<i> We would certainly need some UI tools once we embark down that road,
</I>&gt;<i> however ;)
</I>
I did consider using a gtk+ menu driven installer running using
DirectFB instead of xorg.
But I never made enough time to fully play around with that.
Also for a little bit more disk space having a usable xorg and window
manager would be preferable since not many people use DirectFB.
I have not used DirectFB in more than 5 years at least.


&gt;<i> if the I/R's install says, &quot;Now you need to make a choice between the
</I>&gt;<i> Graphical UI installer, and the installation of X, a Window Manager
</I>&gt;<i> (KDE, Gnome, XFCE), and Firefox upon completion of the installation
</I>&gt;<i> process, or the standard, faster, traditional installation method on the
</I>&gt;<i> CLI (You may also still choose to have the Window Manager installed from
</I>&gt;<i> the binary package to save time and recompile later)&quot;.....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That kind of thing?
</I>
Having a repository of archives for architectures is mildly problematic
and far too much like a pre-compiled binary based distro.
If I did not want to put it on the I/R
then I do not want to host it separately for download.
It would amount to a larger workload for me.


&gt;<i> I'm not at all against it, I just think it needs further discussion as
</I>&gt;<i> this is a *Big* to do da.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It potentially changes a major course of the philosophy of Sorcerer -
</I>&gt;<i> even though Sorcerer is way beyond a *proof of concept*.
</I>
Looks like the next set of Sorcerer I/R will be without xorg.
It is not a lot of savings and xorg does not require long to compile
so it is no great loss of convenience nor savings of space.
But since we are at the point of release for X11R7.6
now is the time to decide!

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So there cant be just one size fits all sort of installation because
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO i dont think its possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm w/Pekka on this. Preservation of the Sorcerer way w/perhaps some
</I>&gt;<i> quick to do da's for the impatient?
</I>
A pre-compiled binary based distro is nearly a one-size fits all solution.
Even if we try to resist xorg closing in on our headless and console only boxes
the brutal truth is that requirements are becoming more complex and
software that we might not expect to require xorg
might bring it in as a requirement
because it requires gobject-introspection
at some point in the requirement chain.


&gt;&gt;<i> If Sorcerer comes as a full bush
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then it can be pruned down to size easily.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But if it comes as a little seed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then it requires a bit of time to grow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So with that in mind... Why would I want to do an install twice? Once to
</I>&gt;<i> install the OS and the other actually being a sort of *uninstall*, where
</I>&gt;<i> I spend half the day 'dispelling'.
</I>
Well, it would be a bush, not a tree.
Not everything bit of software that Sorcerer supports
could be provided pre-compiled all on a single CDROM.
That would make it seem very much like a pre-compiled binary based distro.

As for dispelling... invoke sorcery and use the dispel menu.
sorcery is excellent for selecting software for removal.
The ease of removing installed software
might be one of the best things about Sorcerer?


&gt;<i> Man - just nmap an RH, Fedora, or CentOS box out of the gate, LOL!
</I>
Yes, Sorcerer boxes do not normally come with 200 open ports and
services running.
But it is not perfectly clean either.
At least having bind running might be useful if
there are no known name servers immediately available.
And running openssh's sshd is useful for logging in.


&gt;&gt;<i> There is a difference between required for initial installation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and becoming permanently required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And therein lies the solution to the issue I'm concerned with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having a *choice* between *expert* (cli) install and GUI install in this
</I>&gt;<i> way doesn't detract at all, IMO, from the philosophy, utility, and
</I>&gt;<i> superiority of Sorcerer Linux.
</I>
Sorcerer might not be superior at anything,
but it has strengths and weaknesses.
Maintaining a good compromise is ideal.
One might even say that having the menu driven installer
instead of 40 pages of docs
explaining how to install by command line
is a good compromise.
I doubt there are many SAs which are skilled at doing
a manual installation of Sorcerer using LUKS encrypted devices.
The menu driven installer gives that options to SAs
without having to know the commands to type in order
to create and activate LUKS encrypted devices.


&gt;&gt;<i> If it seems useful for rescue it might just go onto the Install/Rescue CD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> um... one final note on my part....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It isn't the size, that matters so much wrt the I/R, although for some
</I>&gt;<i> cases, a small I/R is indeed a real bonus. But I have I/R disks that I
</I>&gt;<i> carry with me, so the Download time vs bandwidth argument isn't so great
</I>&gt;<i> an issue for me - However:
</I>
I have long wanted to make possible credit card sized Sorcerer CDs.
But even fitting a network driven install method onto a 40M CD is difficult.


&gt;<i> Debian has three basic install methods:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.) fat
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.) netinst (minimal - most closely resembling a Sorcerer install)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.) PXE (we could do this too, and we've already discussed USB)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> wrt Debian, for example, I generally use my netinst disk, unless
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth is an issue (I bill by the hour anyway, although it is
</I>&gt;<i> certainly not my intent to great more billable hours this way).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I get my install and *decide* what I need from there (Again, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> watering the seed and not pruning the tree).
</I>
At one time I explored the possibilities of using an across network mounted
Sorcerer I/R CDROM image, Sorcerer thin client, and sshfs, and httpfs methods
for being able to provide a small Sorcerer I/R while the bulk of the files
were downloaded as needed.
But it is slow.

I also explored the use of a network mounted file system with
a file system union view in order to allow for more software
to appear installed and be usable than what is actually installed.
That is also very slow and very problematic when running ldconfig.

Maybe something halfway usable with an almost decent speed
could be set up using SAMBA running locally to cache requests to
and content downloaded from the server across the Internet.
But I was not pleased with the experiments.

My opinion is that the best experience while installing Sorcerer
comes from having all the required software provided as archives
on the I/R and having the I/R written to USB flash drive instead of CDROM.



&gt;&gt;<i> ...Sorcerer SAs are expected to be able to use a command line
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and to use the sorcery, cast, dispel, and augur tools.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An installation that is too fluffy to being with misrepresents
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the fact that getting the most out of a Sorcerer box
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requires some ability with using a command line shell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There ya go ;) although I'm certainly not against a gui tool like
</I>&gt;<i> *aptitude* or *pkgtool* :)
</I>
Perhaps it is my limited way of thinking,
but what can be accomplished with a GUI tool
that can not be accomplished using dialog?
Dialog has some limitations in output.
It is like having only a single window
and the dimensions are restricted
by the rows and columns of the display device.
But it has that excellent compromise of being
usable without X11 from a linux virtual console.


Thanks for the feedback from everyone.
If Sorcerer SAs prefer a minimalistic start
then that is the aim.

Overall it is not a terrible inconvenience for true Sorcerer SAs.
A Sorcerer SA will usually have another box with a full archive
that can be shared for quick installation of QT KDE or whatever
else they want.
Only the first time Sorcerer SAs
must start out slim and have to wait for compilation.
