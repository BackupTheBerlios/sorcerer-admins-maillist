<PRE>Following someone's advise I added instructions to have gettext's
library installed
although I knew that glibc provided the same functionality.
After the headers and library for gettext's libraries became
incompatible with glibc
then boxes broke bad because almost everything was linked with
gettext's libraries
and yet gettext's libraries had to be removed.
Some SAs had to redeploy boxes from I/Rs.
It was the first great Sorcerer upgrade blunder.

Thanks to Ulrich Drepper we can now enjoy a blast from the past.

&gt;<i>From glibc's NEWS file:
</I>
&quot;* The RPC implementation in libc is obsoleted.  Old programs keep working
  but new programs cannot be linked with the routines in libc anymore.
  Programs in need of RPC functionality must be linked against TI-RPC.
  The TI-RPC implementation is IPv6 enabled and there are other benefits.&quot;

That is half correct.
Everything compiled and linked against glibc version 2.13 or older
continues to receive it's RPC functionality.
However, libtirpc requires RPC functions that are no longer provided
in glibc version 2.14 and above.
Consequently, libtirpc does not compile.
Consequently, nfs-utils does not compile.
Consequently, on a glibc version 2.14.1 box
NFS works until it must be re-compiled.
And then it can not be re-compiled or upgraded and remains broke.
This is slightly more than irritating.
However, coda can be substituted instead of NFS.

Evert has already reverted his workstation to glibc 2.13
because kdenlive segmentation faults when run with glibc version 2.14.1
I discovered that megaglest and additional software segmentation faults
instead of even being able to start after upgrading to glibc version 2.14.1.
The typical x86_64 specific crash on firefox download bug seems to be squished,
but now firefox crashes more randomly and especially when dealing with
FTP servers.
Overall glibc version 2.14.1 feels buggier than glibc 2.13
in spite of 2.14.1 being a bug fix release for the 2.14 branch.

Normally, upgrading glibc would be a sane and positive experience.
This time we can not bare to go forward.
However, glibc is not like any other library.
Software compiled and linked with the newer glibc
can only be run by the newer glibc.
Therefore, reverting glibc to 2.13 will cause
all software that compiled afterward to require
re-compilation in order to work.
And if that software was gcc
then gcc itself will not run.
If the software is bash
then the shell will NOT run.
Some boxes that have upgraded glibc will break BAD!
Nothing short of a skilled SA and Install/Rescue disk
will be of use fixing them.
Sorry about that.

The decision to revert glibc to 2.13 is the lesser of two evils.
And switching to eglibc, the fork of glibc, is no better of a solution.
It probably has many of the same bugs since it still imports almost
all of it's code from glibc.  And it's 2.14 release also lacks RPC.
eglibc still remains 99.9% glibc with a few additional patches applied.

The glibc software authors decide what glibc should be
and when it should be released.
Unfortunately, the quality of glibc 2.14.1 is so lacking
that some software potentially a larger selection than realized
remains unusable or crashy with glibc 2.14.1

Unfortunately, I blundered into this because at the time
the upgrade seem to solve the firefox crashing problem.
But now more software than firefox is crashing,
and firefox also still crashes, all-be-it less predictably.

I apologize for racing into the upgrade.
I did not bother researching what problems might exist
with glibc 2.14.1 since I would have expected that
sometime after the release of 2.14.1, 2.14.2 would be
released to solve problems if they exist.

Unfortunately, encountering bugs is par for the course of free software.
glibc authors and Sorcerer maintainers have no direct contact.
They do not warranty the quality or suitability of their software
and neither does Sorcerer.

When kernel.org is obviously rooted by an unskilled script kiddy
and glibc, perhaps the single most important library on a box,
is bugged and missing important functionality it does give cause
to wonder whether the ship is sinking.

I spent 5 days bailing water trying to make nfs-utils a possibility.
And I would have had to create close to 100 new spells
just to make nfs-utils work.
This is unacceptable.

Anyway, Sorcerer SAs are warned about the reversion.
And Sorcerer SAs should have their own backups.
Therefore, the worst possible scenario should involve recovery from a backup.

The good news is that &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; boxes are still protected.
I have not upgraded their grimoire.
They still enjoy old bugs instead of new bugs.
I only upgrade the &quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; grimoire before
doing a new I/R release.
And the glibc upgrade did not bring us close to a new I/R release
but delayed that possibility for more than a week.

And so that is the situation.

Frankly, I would be plenty pleased to have boxes that are based on uClibc,
but that sacrifices the use of pre-compiled drivers for NVIDIA cards,
pre-compiled plugins for firefox, adobe acrobad, open office and anything
else that comes pre-compiled.

Likewise I would not be displeased to have more static linking on Sorcerer.
However, static linking of software introduces several drawbacks in addition
to increasing the size of installed executable files.

I have yet to discover a compromise that insulates us from bad glibc
and provides us with compatibility with pre-compiled binary software.

If glibc was like any other ELF library
then it's soname would change when binary compatibility breaks
and each new version of glibc would not maintain all the old API
for every version that came before it.
If glibc was like any other ELF library
then boxes could upgrade and downgrade and sidegrade glibc
any way the SA wants without causing an insurmountable problem.
Unfortunately, glibc is not that way.

Fortunately, not all boxes will break bad.
Some might not break at all.
But be alert and be certain to manually recast
all software compiled and linked with glibc version 2.14.1
after glbic version 2.13 is re-installed.
