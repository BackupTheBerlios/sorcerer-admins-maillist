</I>
Thanks for saying so.
Often my ideas differ from trends of other distros
so providing explanation helps show the reason why
rather than making silent changes,
keeping SAs in the dark
or spewing semi random looking mandates.
The 2G /boot might be the strangest aspect of Sorcerer,
but it is made with consideration for both present and future conditions.
Obviously, hindsight is 20/20 and
consequently, I do not have a history of making
the best size recommendations for /boot
If every possible lilo label were used
then 2G would not be enough for the current implementation.

$ ls -lah /boot/2.6.39.1/{linux,initrf*}
-rw------- 1 root root  97M Jun  3 07:24 /boot/2.6.39.1/initrf
-rw------- 1 root root  97M Jun  3 06:39 /boot/2.6.39.1/initrf.old
-rw------- 1 root root 2.0M Jun  3 01:55 /boot/2.6.39.1/linux

As it is now each label can require about about 200M.
If we switch to a bootloader than supports loading multiple
initrf with a kernel then about half the above size can be
factored out into an initramfs that is common for all boot labels.
However, as it stands linux will not change position when
initramfs images are updated.
And by keeping initrf.old from the previous time
then the box can survive at least one reboot
where for some unexpected reason lilo refuses to reinstall.

$ ls -lah /boot/rescue/{linux,initrf*}
-rw------- 1 root root  41M May 23 23:53 /boot/rescue/initrf
-rw------- 1 root root 1.9M May 23 23:53 /boot/rescue/linux

This is a bit more ideal because neither the linux or initrf files
will change their position on disk when other initramfs are updated.

Some boxes will not have sufficient space on /boot
for initrf.old files.
So those boxes will do a copy, fail,
then remove the initrf.old and do the copy again.
So I am not forcing the expansion of /boot on boxes
that are incapable.
However, the gradual growth of initrf is not easily mitigated.


&gt;<i> Yes we hashed this out here on the list a little less than a year ago,
</I>&gt;<i> due to issues, in particular, with XFS.
</I>
Perhaps I remember it as &quot;XFS does not have a reserved boot sector?&quot;
I have since updated the menu driven installer to disallow combinations
that I know will not work without a dedicated /boot.
And I have also recently modified it to enforce a 2G /boot


&gt;<i> I'm wondering if there are any actual advantages/disadvantages
</I>&gt;<i> to using ext3 or otherwise on /boot.
</I>
Many SAs would feel tempted to use ext3 instead of ext2
because ext3 is expected to be superior to ext2.
However, what are the advantages to ext3 over ext2?
ext3 can play back a journal instead of fscking
after rebooting unclean.
ext3 has delayed write I/O
And ext3 has a journal that consumes actual disk space.

$ find /boot | wc -l
26

So first we see that /boot has very few nodes to check
and is a modest size of 2G so fscking /boot requires
a bit less time than a sneeze.

&gt;<i>From examining the initramfs and sorcery tools we see
</I>that files are not created on /boot but instead created elsewhere
and then copied onto /boot.
And nearly anytime /boot is updated an immediate sync follows
because we want to know for certain that the on disk data
exactly matches how it should be.
So there is no use for delayed writing and a journal.

So a /boot with ext3 is basically an ext2 boot that has less space
because some space is being consumed by a journal
and also is a file system that updates slower because it would
not immediately sync but instead have a 5 second commit interval value.

Back when I used ext3 for file systems,
ext3 could be mounted without a journal to provide an ext2.
So when doing backups I always mounted the backup file system
as ext2, although it really was an ext3.
This granted greater throughput.
ext3 and ext4 are useful for / file systems that are always mounted and in use.
However, for /boot and backup file systems ext2
can be a better choice for faster more immediate throughput.
ext3 for /boot merely wastes space on a journal.

# umount /boot
# time fsck.ext2 -f /dev/sda1
e2fsck 1.41.14 (22-Dec-2010)
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Pass 5: Checking group summary information
/dev/sda1: 35/131072 files (22.9% non-contiguous), 170837/524288 blocks

real    0m1.311s
user    0m0.300s
sys     0m0.140s

*Achew*
Oh, so close, I was almost faster than fsck.


&gt;<i> Maybe it's time that I look at ext3/4 for /boot? yes/no?
</I>
Mine is only one point of view with no shortage of ignorance.
There might be compelling reasons for using ext3 or ext4 for /boot.
However, at the moment the only thought that comes to mind
is that /boot has nearly infinitely more inodes than it requires.

Probably making the best /boot file system involves
trimming the extra inodes and excessive amount of super blocks.
However, for most boxes /boot on Sorcerer should be a regular
no frills ext2 file system.

Thanks for asking.
I realize that my selection of such things as ext2 for /boot
and 2G for boot might often seem like mere personal preference.
But there is some logic behind the selections.
And I am trying to create a path that is sufficiently easy
for new Sorcerer SAs to traverse.
When a SA transitions to Sorcerer
they usually have memorized only the old paradigm
from pre-compiled binary based distros.
Therefore, assumptions about /boot
have a high probability of being incorrect.
Sometimes the /boot or lack of /boot might even be unusable.

SAs unaware of Sorcerer's different compromises may become irritated.
They know without doubt that 100M is plenty for /boot.
And yet the box fails to boot after the first update of linux.
They knowing that 1G is sufficient for swap.
And yet the newly deployed box swap locks to a halt.
This cause irritation to many new Sorcerer SAs
especially when they do not understand why it happened.

Consequently, I added to my todo list to add a section
to the menu driven installer that explains the Sorcerer paradigm.
It is not to say that I never bothered to do it.
But I tried submitting a series of papers to freshmeat
to explain the source based paradigm
and they would not publish nor even award me a complimentary T-shirt.
And so the files became lost long ago.
Yet I suppose after all that time I have nearly forgotten what
the old paradigm was or how Sorcerer differs.
To summarize it in a single sentence
I would probably say that the old paradigm was
to aspire to the very least common denominator among 80386 computers.
When expanded to the distro-specific aspects such as /boot,
memory utilization, cpu utilization, and bandwidth utilization
and contrasting Sorcerer with a pre-compiled binary based distro
then we start to see that the two are as different as the sun and the moon.
Pre-compiled based distros are like the moon which reflect the light
of the far greater box that was used to compile the packages.
And Sorcerer boxes are like the sun which radiates
it's own unique warmth and light.

Hopefully, I can explain the technical differences,
provide interesting metaphorical contrast,
and yet still have it entirety be succinct.

The few technical details that the menu driven installer currently provides
are only available for viewing when the SA makes a selection
between &quot;novice&quot; and &quot;expert&quot; mode.
I was made an incorrect assumption to put it there.
Obviously it goes unread.
Hopefully, I can fix that in the next set of I/Rs.
Hate to be this way, but I guess I must use a
&quot;shove it in their face&quot; approach.
I realize it will be a bit more than annoying,
because we will have to tap enter a few times
and then confirm that we understood before
proceeding with installation.
But it is the lesser of two evils compared to a SA
doing an installation that will become problematic.

That might become a compromise that helps
push Sorcerer in a direction of becoming a distribution
suitable for use by experienced SAs.
I never wanted it to be this way,
but more aggressive measures will be required
to ensure the SA complies.

For the moment I already changed the implementation
to disallow the SA defining /boot on a partition
that is less than 2G.
But I could easily automatically partition
the disk to create a 2G /boot partition
with the bootable flag enabled and force
that on all installations.
I irritate myself thinking about that.

For all it's flexibility the menu driven installer probably has
more ways to create a failed installation
than ways to create valid installations.
I want to give skilled SAs
a nice long rope to accomplish what they want
with the convenience of using the menu driven installer.
Yet at the same time when novice SAs
stretch their necks and dangle from the rope
then they blame me.
&gt;<i>From my point of view it is a perplexing challenge.
</I>
Every now and then SAs write to say,
&quot;Sorcerer is too difficult to install.&quot;
Really?  Is it?
Without watching what they do I might never know.
With few exceptions it is merely a matter of
pressing arrow keys, space bar, and enter.
I am not certain what to think about it.

Hopefully, the future will bring changes that
helps new SAs across the bridge
without the experienced SAs feeling
shackled and dragged across.

So maybe an automatically created /boot partition for &quot;novice&quot; mode,
and merely the 2G size enforcement for &quot;expert&quot; mode?
I can not help making the &quot;novice&quot; mode of the installer
extremely unpalatable for experienced SAs.
But we always that the option to switch modes and re-partition.

The novice mode could be made to query an installation device from the SA
and automatically create a 2G ext2 /boot partition, 4G swap, and to put
the rest on an ext4 / or is that too harsh?
Besides an ext2 /boot would probably be unnecessary with an ext4 /

Should the menu driven installer have a
&quot;novice&quot; mode an &quot;expert&quot; mode and an &quot;automatic&quot; mode?
Perhaps it should start in automatic mode and ask the SA just one questions?
Which /dev/sd* device to install Sorcerer?
With merely the answer to that question
I can lay that down a Sorcerer installation
faster and easier than a 4 course meal.
Is that what new Sorcerer SAs actually require
so that Sorcerer is no longer too difficult to install?

I am irritating myself merely to ask the question because the answer
suggests allowing non SAs to try to drive Sorcerer.
So what comes next?
Automatic network configuration?
Boxes that automatically weekly update with no questions asked?
2 profiles to select from?
Workstation KDE, Workstation Gnome?
If the SA is not truly a SA
then we can abandon all hope of him/her being able to deploy
a console only server box.
Shall we do this.
If so then who wants to help?

I can not help thinking that an automatic installation
is like giving a noob a stick of C7H5N3O6 to use for a match.
Will it change everything.
Or will it explode in their face later?

Okay, I have on my todo list, to consider an automated installation.
The subject is open to debate and opinions.
