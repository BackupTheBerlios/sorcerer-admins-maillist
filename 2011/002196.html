<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>SAs know that their Sorcerer boxes
have an immune system like a living creature.
But the individual components are less than apparent.
For example the important ELF checks and repairs
are embedded directly into cast for optimal efficiency.
And immune tasks that do not require immediate action
were provided by external components such as sorcery-bxz.

However, as I previously mentioned
I am revising all this.
The immune system will be visible.
And I am hyping it today.
This is worth reading to avoid confusing the old with the new.

There is a new category:  immune-system

# augur category immune-system
immune
immune-auto-network
immune-boot-blaze
immune-boot-rescue
immune-exam-alien
immune-exam-clean
immune-exam-integrity
immune-sentinel-elf
immune-sentinel-memory
immune-sentinel-resume
immune-sentinel-space
immune-sentinel-sync

Does it seem larger than expected?
It will continue growing as more is added on.
The following is a brief explanation of each spell.

immune is the profile spell that optional requires all other immune-* spells
immune-auto-network provides automatic wired and wireless network configuration.
immune-boot-blaze provides booting acceleration.
immune-boot-rescue replaces sorcerer-rescue by providing a boot rescue label.
immune-exam-alien replaces sorcery-alien and provides a new twist.
immune-exam-clean replaces sorcery-clean by removing old files.
immune-exam-integrity replaces sorcery-md5sum and is nearly identical.
immune-sentinel-elf replaces only the critical check of sorcery-immune
immune-sentinel-memory defeats the OOM-killer and prevents out of memory halts.
immune-sentinel-resume provides cron like enhancement for sorcery.
immune-sentinel-space replaces sorcery-bxz and tries to immediately
resolve disk space crisis.
immune-sentinel-sync provides configurable synchronization for
auto-piloting a box.

immune-sentinel-space and immune-exam-clean have a similar role,
yet are separate components of the immune system
because at least one SA, Evert :),  prefer an alternate method for pruning
/var/cache/{archive,ccache,sources}/ rather than using immune-exam-clean.

The above explanations are modest.
What appears to be 11 separate components
of the immune system
do tasks fit for more than 20 components.
And that gives no attention to the awesomeness
provided by init-scripts and initramfs.
Much is required to constantly yank a Sorcerer box
back from the brink of destruction
and keep it working exactly as a SA wants,
and freeing the SA from having mundane concerns,
and freeing the SA from performing mundane tasks.
That is why Sorcerer has an immune system that helps
maximize both box performance and SA laziness.
What is not to like about that?
Okay, that concludes the hyping.

Looking at the method for naming the spells
we see that the second word has meaning
Boot indicates that the spell installs something that effects booting.
Exam indicates that an examination is performed when the spell runs.
Sentinel indicates that a daemon starts during boot and continues running.
Does it look nifty that way?

Not everything will be quickened for the improved immune system.
Many years ago a SA requested that Sorcerer have a backup system.
My opinion is that SAs should provide backup systems.
Having backups placed in /var/cache/backup/
does no good if the disk transforms into Swiss cheese.
Therefore, if no one objects
then I am deprecating sorcery-backup.

sorcery-defrag works awesome.
However, re-assembling the fragments of a file
changes the file's location on disk.
Unfortunately, the new positions of files
do not necessarily cause software to load faster.

I did performance testing by clearing the kernel cache
and measuring the startup time of firefox
both before and after de-fragmentation.
The outcome was that firefox started slower after defragmentation.

Because ext2/3/4 file systems lack the logical of UFS;
incidentally close physical grouping of files
occurs only when a software project is installed.
Defragmentation makes file location more random than a tossed salad.
Therefore, I want to deprecate sorcery-defrag
because there is no guarantee that less fragmented files
will reduce wear and tear on the disk device.

Spells that involve the immune system
will be gathered into the new category and new name system.
That should be the next best alternative to shining a spot light on it.
SAs should not be able to miss noticing the immune system.

For those who might want a refresher...
The concept of a distribution immune system manifest itself
from the earliest releases of Sorcerer
and first took form in the program called &quot;heal&quot;
After updating installed software on a box
the SA would run the heal program.
The drive would light up for several minutes
and after performing many tests
the box would cast installed spells that required healing.
While amazing in during it's day
the implementation is pitiful compared to modern healing.

Currently, cast heal check require
less than a second with almost no disk access.
Something that invisible is easier to forget than to hype.
And so instead of becoming more amazing it became trivial, forgotten.
Consequently, I stopped hyping Sorcerer's immune system.

My apathy towards hyping immunity
did not necessarily stall development.
Bits and pieces of new implementations appeared in different spells.
Also my boxes have additional immune system components that
I do not provide on a distribution wide basis.
Consequently, I never lost sight of the importance.
I merely maintained it at an unreasonably low profile.

Therefore, I have decided that I will hype the &quot;automatic install&quot;
in addition to the new and improved immune system.
While Sorcerer is far from the niche of a noob friendly distro
Sorcerer will provide non SAs with the opportunity to try Sorcerer.
The non SA can select an automatic installation,
and the box will install Sorcerer,
pop the CD out, reboot,
and a few minutes later start automatically installing kde-v4
and other software useful for a workstation installation
nearly as if the SA had cast it.
Then after much time has elapsed
the box will be ready for reboot
and provide a GUI login.

While I can not take credit for coining the phrase &quot;DOS for Dummies,&quot;
how about &quot;Sorcerer for Simians&quot; yes?
Now anybody can monkey around with Sorcerer.
:<i>)
</I>
This seems like a very reasonable compromise between
a traditional Sorcerer installation and a Dead Disk distribution.
With new Install/Rescue CDs provided several times a year
how much more lively can Sorcerer's I/R become, yes?

Unfortunately, the non SAs that wanted
a 650M &quot;Dead Disk&quot; version of Sorcerer
have already departed grumpy and unsatisfied.
However, these improvements demonstrate
that I am listening to everyone.
I am trying to provide compromises that will give
all Sorcerer SAs something to be pleased about.
Consequently, Sorcerer is not copying
other distros' cliched 650 megabyte &quot;Dead Disk.&quot;
Instead Sorcerer will provide &quot;Sorcerer for Simians.&quot;
Why evolve into a SA?
Why not relax and let the Sorcerer box automatically
install and build itself into a comfortable workstation?

This goal has always been a possibility.
The reason for neglecting it was because
Sorcerer development maintained a strong focus
on providing only what senior level SAs want.
In comparison to other distros we achieved it.
And so the next step is paving way for the less experienced.

An unfortunate reality is that sorcery
is a tool to be wielded by skilled SAs.
Intermediate level SAs will struggle.
Noob SAs have 1% chance.
And that is why Sorcerer for noobs is impossible.

Consequently, I am calling this new approach, &quot;Sorcerer for Simians.&quot;
The evolution of non SAs into a SAs is almost as unlikely
as the evolution of simians into homo sapiens.
Consequently, the focus is not to train non SAs in our arcane methods.
Rather the focus is to expect that the distribution should
be able to automatically provide for non SAs.

If I maintain a test installation of Sorcerer
the same as an automatic install provided for Simian SAs
then I should be able to experience, anticipate, and solve their problems
on the distribution wide level
provided that they do not vary the configuration
nor the software loadout on their boxes.

This new sub-project, &quot;Sorcerer for Simians&quot;
might have many unanticipated consequences.
I am fortunate that existing Sorcerer SAs are
an excellent group of sharp thinkers and nice people.
I am hoping existing Sorcerer SAs
with a year or more experience
will act as ambassadors for the new group of users.

More of us will have opportunities to supply
technical support, advice, and information to the new SAs.
My role in that will diminish, due to both time constraints
and my inability to cultivate the perspective of someone
who is unfamiliar with the duties and skills of a SA.
However, as usual I will continue fishing and implementing
good ideas and suggestions from the conversation
that traverses the email list.
Everyone will gain more opportunities
to cooperate and participate more if they want.

I realize that some SAs already thought,
&quot;Damit, we don't need noobs!
Nothing good will come from this!&quot;
I concede that disappointed may become the norm
rather than the exception when helping noobs.
However, a totally fresh perspective is not without
benefits that can not be anticipated by veteran SAs.
And therefore, the potential exists that we will
all benefit from the fresh and inexperienced people that join.
Therefore, let us try to be open-minded about this sub-project.

I am feeling optimistic because Sorcerer SAs
have compassion, skill, and tenacity in abundance.
No shy noobs will feel denigrated and depressed from our replies.
Instead we will inspire them.
People with SA potential we can assist in becoming
our comrades and eventually our successors.
