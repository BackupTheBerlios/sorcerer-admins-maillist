<PRE>There were not many 80686 CPU class CPUs
that were made without PAE support.
Although the linux kernel can boot it;
it becomes an additional backache
for any distro that choose to test and make
an additional kernel or additional I/R
that lacks PAE support.

A person might ask then, why bother making a PAE enabled kernel?
Yes, why indeed?
PAE is only required in order to access installed RAM
that is in excess of 4G on an 80686 box.

Very few single core 80686 have more than 4G of RAM installed.
However, a SMP 80686 or an x86_64 box might have more than 4G of RAM.
Why buy the additional RAM and then be unable to use it?

And that is why the 80686-SMP-PAE enabled I/R exists.
The non-SPM no PAE required I/R exists only for booting
PentiumM centrino laptops.

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrino">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrino</A>

Only the Carmel platform is effected by this blunder.
So only laptops from the 2003 through 2004 era are effected.
80686 CPU based laptops from earlier and later do not have the problem.

So 7 years later someone says something like,
&quot;Sorcerer does not install on my laptop because it says PAE required&quot;
And I was thinking,
&quot;Wow that is such a mismatch.
because those laptops could barely boot and run Windoze
after the first service pack was installed.
The speed and quantity of installed RAM
was intended for earlier generation of operating system.
Sorcerer will only be usable on it if the laptop has
already received a RAM upgrade to 1 gigabyte of 400 MHz RAM.&quot;

And so I made the I/R even while expecting that
if it is a stock laptop that installation will be impossible
due to an insufficient amount of installed RAM.
Yet, I should have done as Evert suggested,
and said that &quot;Obsolete computers are not supported.&quot;
That way I could have relaxed and slept during the weekend.

However, what is done is done.
And the new I/Rs are spiffy nifty
with the init improvements.

Some SAs might wonder...
Will installing the uniprocessor non-PAE kernel with I/R
on an 80686 with less than 4G of installed RAM
provide better performance than the 80686 SMP I/R?
And the answer is both obvious and not obvious.
Performance is better, until about a day later
when kernel authors make available a newer linux.
Single core 80686 boxes with a SMP kernel installed
automatically downgrade to a UP kernel when linux compiles.
Therefore, unnecessary overhead required for SMP
is discarded like a snake's old skin
Given that benefit is automatic,
I much rather not provide
an additional kernel or additional I/R for CPUs
that lack PAE support.
Yet someone asked me and so I did.

Sorry for the long reply.
There is no reason why a SA should learn today about PAE.
Perhaps all CPUs on new computers have &quot;lm&quot; &quot;long mode&quot;
or what is also known as the x86_64 instruction set.
These boxes are good to go up to 64G of installed RAM.
2^36 is much smaller than 2^64.
So eventually computers should be able to upgrade to
more RAM without using a PAE style/method that
involves paging in additional RAM.
So PAE is in most ways a dead topic.
It was a workaround for a limitation
of the previous generation of CPUs.

Someone previously mentioned that jdk might be broke.
I discovered that the spell was symbolic linking
the file with the proper name.
The file also had the proper content.
But the file was not in the proper place.
That exact file occurred more than once in the installation.
Symbolic linking the other location fixed the jdk web browser plugin.
How odd is that?
