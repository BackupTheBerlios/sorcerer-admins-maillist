<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Evert has valid points.
I agree that the flaws in security occur
due to bugs in software, naive users,
and inadequate or incorrectly configured services.
If all software, users and SAs were perfect
then classical security would work perfectly.
But since we live in an imperfect world
sometimes imperfect solutions work best.

In a previous email I stated that
over a decade ago a nefarious user
gained unauthorized root by exploiting a bug in vixie cron.
Back then every box had vixie cron installed by default.
We never know which user will betray
nor do we know which innocent looking service
will become a stepping stone to unauthorized root access.

Many years ago an incompetent SA accused me
of cracking into his box
in order to download mp3 files.
He gave two reasons.
First, I previously told him to switch to shadow passwords,
for all the obvious reasons.
Second, someone cracked his box from a .mil address
and so he suspected me.

But the foolishness of his accusation was
evident considering the fact that via scp and my user account
I already had sufficient privilege to download all the mp3s
and very nearly any file that I wanted from that box.
Therefore, why would I do any cracking
to accomplish a task that that is already possible?
And thus by his own folly he ended his association with me.

If we do not allocate the effort to enhance security
then we risk being cracked
through something innocent looking like vixie cron.
If we do not allocate the the effort to enhance security
then we risk becoming a foolish SA
that accuses friends and discards friendship
without ascertaining proof beyond a doubt.

Enhanced security can be worth more than the cost of backing
up a few files to restore in the event of a malicious attack.
Enhanced security is like a kidney guard that not only blocks
the lethal stab from behind, but might yet grant us the opportunity
to pivot and squarely look our attacker in the face.
Without it then we have only 20/20 hindsight
to indicate that we might have benefited from enhanced security.

Although not always obvious,
I like the idea of enhanced security.
The the grimoire is full of security related software such as &quot;ninja.&quot;
The concept of &quot;ninja&quot; is good, but the implementation aught to be in
the kernel.
The kernel can block unauthorized execution.
Ninja can merely detect, log, and kill a process sometime
after the damage might have already been accomplished.
An unauthorized process could easily kill ninja before
ninja could detect and kill it.

The grimoire also has a considerable amount of encryption software.
Security might not prevent bytes from being stolen, but encryption can.
And of course Sorcerer's installer supports LUKS style encryption of
block devices.
So even if our fixed disks find a new home
our unencrypted bytes do not travel with them.

For a considerable time I have been interested
in selinux, grsecurity, tomoyo style enhanced security.
But for a while my motivation waned due to several reasons.
I did not want to delay kernel releases while waiting for grsecurity's
patch releases.
And selinux requires unrealistic amount of effort in order to secure
every file on a box.
A couple of years ago or so I tried SMAC.
After enabling it in the kernel
then the kernel failed booting.
I suspect I tried tomoyo unsuccessfully years ago
because I entered the ccs-tools years ago.
However, currently, tomoyo's tool set has a different name.

Last week my first few times trying to boot
a tomoyo enabled kernel lacked success.
However, I eventually obtained success.
Yet if successful booting continued to remain elusive
then I would probably have waited a year or two
before trying tomoyo again or whatever was available in the future.

There are no obvious definite broad and thoroughly traveled paths
leading to the happy land of enhanced security.
However, selinux seemed to be the most hyped method.
I could not help but wonder if a lack of selinux support
would make Sorcerer seem less attractive for security roles.

Sorcerer's main method for security is stealth.
Each box sails like a custom ghost ship
without striking an audacious banner
that announces it's allegiance to Sorcerer.
And by disabling ICMP echo reply
and/or running services on custom ports
then a box gains an even lower radar cross section.

With tomoyo enhanced security implemented
the ghost ship will look and sail nearly the same.
Yet it will have gained invisible lethal traps
for containing unauthorized boarding parties.
Who would not want to few automatic surprises
prepared for those attempting to gain unauthorized access?

Certainly, we are prepared for the broadside attack,
but we must also be wary of the single row boat
that carries an intruder who intends to silently scale
the hull of the ship while searching for an unlatched cannon porthole.
Then like a living shadow glides through the interior
finding way to the captain's cabin.
And while the captain sleeps
the intruder don the captain's uniform
and barks orders to an obedient and unwary crew.

But what if after opening the unlatched porthole
the cannon discharges in the intruder's face?
The unwanted boarder is effectively repelled
and the crew can be roused and the captain alerted.

The reality of computer security these days
is not like a battle with an exchange of broadsides
as envisioned in computer games and BBS doors
during the 1980s.
Offensive capability is not determined by the available bandwidth.
nor is defense capability determined by the size of a fixed disk.
Actual computer security is far from the fun simulations
presented in computer games and movies.

The threat most often comes from a lone individual
or virus operating stealthily or through subterfuge.
Such entities will not be playing
by the established rules of computer security.
Therefore, neither should our defense assume
that standard security should be sufficient.


I am enjoying and appreciating
how both sides of this table are being debated.
We owe thanks to Evert for supporting
what might possibly be the more difficult position.
In the reality of the constant evolution of computers and software
we almost always want to assume that newer is better.
Therefore, supporting a position of tradition already beings
with the disadvantage of that prejudicial expectation
that traditional methods might already be obsolete.

Hopefully with discussion we can achieve
a compromise that is attractive
to both the properly paranoid SAs
and the SAs too busy to bother
with studying tomoyo documentation.

Because of the overuse of the word &quot;policy&quot;
understanding tomoyo documentation is slightly less than trivial.
While smaller in scope and reading than httpd documentation,
the required understanding for effectively configuring tomoyo
is no less demanding than configuring httpd with virtual hosts.
Hopefully, I can bring some good benefits of tomoyo to Sorcerer
without SAs having to understand it.
In that way it can be a bit like Linux-PAM, shadow passwords, glibc, etc...
It can be installed and work adequately
while not requiring SAs to read the documentation
to gain understanding of how it exactly works.

Making tomoyo domain transition entirely transparent will be impossible.
But it should be no more problematic than typing a command such as
sulogin

</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, don't put anything on a computer that you don't want exposed
