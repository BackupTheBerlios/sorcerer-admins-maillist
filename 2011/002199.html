<PRE>Interesting.
Given that information,
Sorcerer seems distant from the &quot;bleeding edge.&quot;

I feel content to wait for BTRFS developers to
state that BTRFS is stable and ready for production use.
I am hoping that Evert will continue
to inform me about BTRFS.
He is a fan of BTRFS.
If both Pekka and Evert work together
on gathering information about BTRFS
then the eventual introduction of BTRFS
to Sorcerer could be better than it is currently.
At the moment it remains a file system selection menu option.
However, I have not invested time in knowing
anything about how it differs from a regular file system.
Perhaps the method of installing all of Sorcerer into
the ?root? of the BTRFS is less desirable than first
making some sort of BTRFS sub volume?
Maybe I read somewhere or Evert said that BTRFS
like sort of like the love child of LVM2 and a journaling file system?
Obviously, it can accomplish more
than the menu driven installer currently allows.
Maybe before they complete BTRFS
it will be able to do AES encryption also?

Yet I am not pleased by a file system that can do everything.
There is some eloquence for having individual projects
each with the narrow focus of doing just one task skillfully
such as LVM2 providing an interface
for making the device mapper do logical volumes.
And while LVM2 can do striping
probably mdraid still remains
the best choice for creating RAIDs.

I am uncertain if adding RAID and LVM like functionality
creates a better file system.
Is a larger code base with enough features
to please a huge crowd of eclectic people
actually preferable to a concise, easier
and faster to debug implementation?

<A HREF="http://thefirstwonderoftheworld.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/worlds-largest-pizza-121-feet/">http://thefirstwonderoftheworld.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/worlds-largest-pizza-121-feet/</A>

If so then perhaps the above is the evolution of pizza?
Was is it cooked evenly everywhere?
Will everyone who wants
be able to receive a slice with crust
from the circumference?
Can we be certain that nobody walked across it?
Did a bird flying above drop extra toppings
that became indistinguishable from
melted mozzarella cheese?
Did leaves or dust blow in and settle on top?
Did bugs arrive first during preparation and become
part of the extra meat topping?

An implementation that tries to do too much
becomes nearly impossible to detect and
account for every possible bug
in the same way that a gigantic outdoor pizza
also becomes impossible to defend
from bugs, birds, rain, dust, etc...

Of course I probably have no idea what I am talking about.
As a vegan my mind is frequently obsessed
with the thought of eating a pizza.
And yet as a vegan I do not eat pizza.
Perplexing.
Perhaps I just wanted an excuse to write an email
that had something about pizza in it?

Yet as long as I do not want to eat bugs
then I intend to stay clear of BTRFS and gigantic pizzas.
If we remember history,
the early implementations of ext3
just prior to it becoming stable had a bugs in it.
Fortunately, those bugs were discovered, owned and fixed.

I heard merely rumors that some people lost
data on reiserfs file systems.
I have no details about it.
But when it was new
I was cautious in spite of the appeal
of using B-trees and being able to tuck
the tails of files directly into the directory structure
in order to make better use of disk space
at the cost of using more RAM for the file system.

One year after a file system is declared stable
becomes a good time for considering it
as a candidate for use on production machines.
Racing into the next new file system
may lower the public appeal for all distros
after SAs claim that data was lost
due to bugs from deploying with
the distribution's recommended file system.

I can understand Redhat wanting to &quot;pioneer&quot;
some new technology.
I do that frequently with Sorcerer.
Sorcerer is constantly making tiny leaps forward.
However, in contrast driving forward
on a nearly untested file system
seems way too risky.

Guarantees do not exist in the world of free software.
However, bugs exist!
We take our chances.
But we can help mitigate our chances
of encountering serious bugs
by staying with older more tested file systems.
That is merely my opinion
with extra cheese, pineapples, peppers, and onions on top
with an extra thick yet crispy crust.
Yummy!
