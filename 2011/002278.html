<PRE>I finally fixed the bind spell.
Had to reach it on my todo list.
However, I have yet to create a custom tomoyo domain for it.
I began pondering what would be a good compromise
between adequate security and maintainability?

If the limited domain was modified to create an extra limited domain
then the extra limited domain could be almost identical except
omit write/modification access to /home/

In contrast tomoyo can be used to trace the execution of processes in a domain
in order to discover which files are accessed, run, modified, etc...
A custom domain can be a very tight box for execution
to exclude reading, writing, modifying, and executing anything
that is not explicitly allowed.
However, the potential exists that when new functionality is added to software
then the domain might exclude the execution and reading of the libraries
that impart the additional functionality.
A custom domain designed for an older version of software
might completely break execution of the software after an update.
Checking and correcting that requires too much effort.

Therefore, I propose that instead of custom domains for software projects
that we have yet an additional domain that is similar to the limited domain
yet has extra limitations concerning where modifications can happen.
More simply put, the additional security will place limitations upon
file modification, but not have limitations concerning file reading
nor file execution.

This compromise is easier to maintain.
Yet it does not necessarily block the execution of undesirable code.
Rather it maintains an invisible barrier that inhibits a rootkit
from being installed.
However, a trojan installed in /tmp could be run
and re-installed on subsequent boots by the same vulnerability
that allowed it to be installed the first time.

Succinctly, the root filesystem and even /home can be protected
against unauthorized modification.
However, to place no limitation on file read/execution
still allows the possibility of the exploit of a vulnerability to run
unauthorized code.

I am uncertain if I like this compromise.
Perhaps I might modify it to also disallow execution of files
from any place that is not also write protected?
That provides a slightly better security, yes?

I am posting this email to gather opinions and input concerning this.
If there are special security concerns that
might be beneficial to implement or consider on a distribution wide basis
then please feel free to reply privately.
