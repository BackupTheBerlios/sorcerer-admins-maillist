As always the use of the menu driven installer is optional.
An experienced Sorcerer SA should be able to do a manual installation.

The automatic installation is for
all of the thrill with none of the skill.
It is fire and forget!

&quot;Target locked on.&quot;

&quot;Yeehaw!&quot;
&quot;Splash one installation onto one fixed disk!&quot;

&gt;<i> Come to think of it, what is the default Sorcerer setup?
</I>
I am confused by the word &quot;default.&quot;
If the question is about the automatic installation
then the setup is very simple.
1 partition, 1 file system, 1 swap file.
The size of the swap file is inversely proportional
to the size of installed RAM.
The swap file is created before files are copied.
Therefore, the swap file is as fragmentation free as possible.
Consequently, using a swap file in this situation
has nearly the same benefit of a swap partition
while avoiding the possibility of confusing the non SA
with the mysterious and complicated concept
of disk partitioning.
And the memory sentinel will keep the non SA
from running the box into a swapping to a halt situation.
Overall the automatic install is better than a 1800 CC motorcycle
with cute little training wheels.
And probably just as silly.

As I mentioned in a previous email...
The automatic installation is not intended
to directly benefit the Sorcerer SA.
The Sorcerer SA can gift a Sorcerer CD to a user.
And the task of installation can be delegated to that user.
Then the SA will have time for non trivial tasks.
And the computer user can gain pleasure
at having his or her full potential challenged
at the intense, exciting, and critical moment
when the enter key must be located and pressed.  :)
This way is more fun for everyone.

Non SAs are failing to install Sorcerer.
I have received plenty of emails
that indicate luck does not compensate for skill.
Consequently, there is not point in making any compromises between
a completely automatic installation and the &quot;novice&quot; menu driven install.
What benefit is gained for asking ext4, ext3, or ext2
to someone who is unfamiliar with the concept of a file system?
Therefore, &quot;automatic installation&quot; necessarily implies &quot;no questions asked.&quot;

Either the person at the keyboard is a SA or they are not a SA.
When it comes to installation, &quot;almost skilled&quot;
is the same as &quot;not enough skill.&quot;
SAs will use the menu driven install methods.
Non SAs will use the automatic install method.
Everyone can be happy.

FAQ

Q: Does the &quot;automatic&quot; installation create the
&quot;Kyle&quot; recommended style of installation.

A: The style is as primitive as possible
to avoid confusing non SAs.
It is sufficient for a user's workstation.
It is insufficient for secure laptops.
It may be insufficient for servers.


Q: Does the &quot;automatic&quot; installation self destruct?

A: Provided that the box has adequate installed RAM
then there is no reason to expect that the automatic installation
would last any longer or shorter than a menu driven installation.
As usual Sorcerer normally outlives
some of the hardware it was originally installed upon.


&gt;<i> If we ever start using syslinux for a bootloader, I'll probably use
</I>&gt;<i> btrfs for / as well.
</I>
Provided that a box has a 2G ext2 /boot
then would there be a reason why btrfs
could not be used for the / file system?
