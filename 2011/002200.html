<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Last year Evert expressed an interest in using extlinux for booting.
If I remember correctly
then he wrote that extlinux can boot BTRFS
without a dedicated ext2 /boot.
I kept that at the bottom of my todo list for almost forever,
but then he mentioned it again about a month ago.
And today I finally made time to research extlinux.

extlinux appears to be able to boot on ext2 ext3 and ext4 file systems.
In some respects it is a little less complicated than lilo to configure.
extlinux does not require to be told where to install.
Instead when providing the command line parameter /boot/extlinux
then extlinux will install to the boot sector of the partition that holds
/boot/extlinux
That level of simplicity surmounts both lilo and grub.

As long as a kernel image or initramfs is not partially in a file
system's journal
then extlinux has a better chance of booting a label than lilo.
In some extreme situations a box must be booted
with an I/R CD in order to recover from a lilo error.
However, the rescue label should be
almost without a doubt remain bootable by extlinux.

My motivation for considering extlinux as an alternative to lilo
has nothing to do with improved robustness.
extlinux supports loading multiple initramfs images for each kernel.
By using that I can further reduce space consumption on /boot
when multiple kernels are installed.
That is why I want extlinux.
That way the 2G /boot might endure longer.
Even 1G /boot might be manageable with 4 or 5 boot labels.

Maybe the next obvious question is,
&quot;Is Sorcerer switching over to extlinux for booting?&quot;
The answer is yes and no.
Boxes deployed with the 20110701 I/R will use extlinux.
However, boxes already deployed will continue using lilo
unless syslinux is installed.

Boxes with syslinux already installed
might be able to reboot after the transition.
That is because I can not test every installation configuration
to ensure that it is syslinux compatible
Also extlinux will receive the default master password of sorcerer.
Therefore, the SA should adjust that in /etc/extlinux/head
in order to prevent people with physical access from
booting with additional parameters such as rdinit=/bin/bash
in order to gain unauthorized root access.
I recommend checking and uninstalling syslinux
unless the SA wants to be among the first to try the new implementation.

The implementation for using extlinux on Sorcerer
is the same as lilo's implementation.
However, instead of /etc/lilo/{head,conf,tail}
extlinux configuration files are /etc/extlinux/{head,conf,tail}
The true extlinux configuration file is actually
/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf
But there is no symbolic link joining
/etc/extlinux/conf  and /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf
The config files are created from the combination of:
/etc/extlinux/head /boot/ and /etc/extlinux/tail
Therefore, customization involves the same familiar
method that we use for lilo.

extlinux's configuration file and menu system differs from lilo.
The style and syntax is somewhat similar.
The syslinux manual page provides sufficient information
to familiarize someone already familiar with lilo's configuration file.

extlinux prints more dots than lilo
while loading the linux and initramfs files.
However, I am uncertain if it is actual slower.
On virtual computer boot speed tests
I was astonished to discover that loading
the kernel and initramfs required
approximately 10 seconds for both extlinux and lilo.

My two main reasons for wanting to switch to extlinux
is because extlinux is actively maintained
and extlinux supports loading multiple initramfs images per kernel.
I have no less favor for lilo.
However, SAs that manage the transition to syslinux
might save headache and effort on some dreadful day
when one must search for the I/R CD to circumvent a lilo error.
Therefore, I am expecting that extlinux + a rescue label
should be enough to boot any box that is unable to
boot the default label.

SAs eager to try the change are advised to wait
until 20110617 rather than use what I already added to the grimoire.
The grimoire contents will require at least 1 day to reach LAG=1 boxes.
And I have yet to discover how to mandate a password
in order to boot the rescue label.
Until I do then the presence of an installed rescue label
presents an opportunity for someone with local physical access
to gain unauthorized access to the root partition by booting the rescue label.
