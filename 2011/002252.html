<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>A recent complaint was that too much happens during sysinit.
And I agree.
And there is also too much scroll during sysinit.
And it scrolls quickly.

However, there is almost no init-scripts in sysinit
that can be moved to a runlevel
that would not sacrifice something important.

As for scroll I discovered that apparently pressing the
scroll lock key pauses sysinit and runlevel.
I am wondering if being able to pause a box during startup
is useful or if it is a security risk.

Also we already know that on virtual console #7 is a login getty
that is available even before sysinit begins.
That way if sysinit hangs or stalls
then a SA can switch to virtual console #7
and log into the initramfs and run utilities such as top
and ps to discover the probable culprit.

However, I am also wondering what small improvements
can or should be made to init-scripts or running init-scripts
that would make booting better.

For the moment I am playing with a simple modification
that turns on the numlock just before running
the command to start a daemon
and then turns off the numlock just before
the init-script exits.
I am not yet certain if that could be useful
or if it is merely a waste of processes and CPU.

Also I am playing with a small modification that allows
cap lock key to be pressed during sysinit,
runlevel 3 and runlevel 5.
Upon detecting caps lock then
cap lock is turned off automatically
and a sulogin prompt is presented
with a 10 second timeout
for providing the root password.

The idea is that if the SA sees something that looked problematic
and wants to jump on it straight away
then the SA can test his arcade game honed reflexes
by pressing cap lock which pauses the scroll
and allows for immediate login.

As we all know already
pressing shift page up or shift page down allows for
paging up and down in a virtual console.
The number of lines saved is not unlimited.
Every line above the visible area is lost
when changing to a different virtual console.
And switching to virtual consoles is easy.
I typically press alt left arrow to switch from
virtual console #1 to virtual console #7
However, from xorg the key sequence would
be something such as pressing ctrl-alt-F7

Runlevels 2 and 4 remain unchanged.
The parallel execution of init-scripts on
runlevel 2 and 4 is appropriate for speed,
but not for debugging a problem.
Runlevels 0 and 6 remain unchanged.
They have the excellent finale menu
that grants a limited opportunity to
login to the Sorcerer's keep
or rebound to into a new run level.

Additional complexity to the init system
in order to try to give it something suitable
for detecting problems and debugging init-scripts
still seems unsuitable at this time.
When I see a significant problem
then I boot with kernel parameter
rdinit=/bin/bash
and hunt the problem by a method
that is very specific to the clues
I previously received.

However, there are some other nifty improvements related to init.

/etc/init.d/Menu
is a rather odd init-script.
When run with parameter configure
then it first prompts for a new command parameter.
Then, it presents a list of init-scirpts
that the SA can select for running
the previously selected parameter with.
It is potentially useful, but difficult to explain.

/etc/init.d/cgroup_{user,daemon,sorcery,idle}
now allow more variables to be configured.
Yet, I am waffling about whether to continue
to allow memory limits to be set for cgroups.
Doing so sometimes disables the ability to disable the oom_killer.
This might be a bug.
Chances are control group is receiving
considerable testing in Sorcerer
that might expose unexpected bugs
that arise from complex configurations.
Yet, control groups are still awesome
and worth learning how to use.

I am still waffling about how aliens should be handled.
SAs do not grant aliens enough attention
and therefore are surprised when a problem arises.
So I made detection and disposition of aliens more amusing.

Spell immune-exam-alien installs /etc/init.d/exam-alien.
The init-script runs during boot.
It immediately returns while leaving a program
running in the background that detects aliens.
After the program completes the list of aliens
can be processed with the command

# /etc/init.d/exam-alien deport

The next screen shows a list of alien files.
But better to goto the command screen first
and select a command such as view, deport, or visa.
Aliens to be ignored can be given a visa.  :)
Aliens to deport are moved
into a similarly named directory structure located under
/var/log/alien/deported/
They can remain their harmlessly forever
or until the SA decides to remove the directory.

I encourage SAs to find and resolve alien problems.
Aliens in /etc/ are not normally problematic and can usually be ignored.
Aliens in library directories can become problematic, especially if
from an older glibc.
Aliens in executable directories can create a future security problem.
If a similarly named executable file
exists in two locations and one is tracked
then the other may be from a very old version
of the same software project from a time when an exploitable bug existed.
So do not expect USA's Homeland Security
to do anything about the illegal alien situation on Sorcerer boxes.
This is a task to be delegated to no person less skilled than the SA.

If someone has ideas about how the num lock light
should indicate something useful during booting
or how pressing cap locks should do something useful
then please contribute suggestions.
For the moment the functionality is provided on a trial basis.
Feedback will determine if it is fluff to be cut
or whether it has merit to be honed into something useful.
The way it stands currently is that the functionality
may not be commensurate with the additional CPU cycles.
However, the increase in complexity is not yet significant.

Yet, I am wondering if SAs trying to read the rapid scroll
during sysinit and runlevel execution are wishing for a
turbo button on the case that can be depressed to release
the box back into a normal cruising speed of 4.77 MHz,
or maybe 16 MHz since we did not have linux before 80386 computers.  :)
I am waffling about the idea of activating
numlock could relegate init-script execution speed
to no greater than 4 init-scripts per second.
Yet I have never before preferred or wanted slow motion booting.

For those wondering about it...
Not all the boot scroll is captured.
However, a large portion of sysinit
and almost anything else that later
arrives at the console
is also directed into the file /var/log/console.
/sbin/bootlogd does that.

Useful information concerning the
parameter used to invoke an init-script
and the outcome of that invocation
are stored in /var/log/init/{passed,failed}/
It is actually there for SAs to view
and is not a substitute for lock files or PIDs.
It is purely informational.
At a glance it may be faster to determine
what one wants to know than by parsing
a console log , dmesg log, or syslog.
It is best viewed immediately after booting.

The bug in sentinel-resume is perhaps finally squished.
If it is misbehaving on non Sorcerer Sentient installations
then please report the problem.
I will be updating Sorcerer Sentient to a newer grimoire very soon.
