</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I could get some explanations for documentation that would be great :)
</I>
Ok.

&gt;<i> `augur`
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Augur View menu and its various reportings (If I can get an
</I>&gt;<i> explanation of each *type* as it relates to it's respective *event*).
</I>
What is the view menu?
I do not remember writing that command.



&gt;<i> Event &#160; Type &#160; &#160;Occurrences
</I>
# augur help event

That command explains the events.


&gt;<i> Also, the 'augur scry' console displays, as in the included image file.
</I>&gt;<i> Could you address the definitions for the *6* columns?
</I>
The first column is a status column
The 2nd column is the spell name column
The third column is the version column
And the final column displays various information such as duration
or time elapsed since event, or a line from the compile log.


&gt;<i> i.e., in the first line we have:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;code&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> [wait] &#160;zip &#160; &#160; 30
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/code&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> presumably, *Sorcery* is 'waiting' to cast *zip*
</I>
That row shows queue counts.
Cast shows how many spells are casting
Wait shows how many spells are queued to be cast
Download shows how many spells are downloading sources
Acquire shows how many spells are waiting to acquire sources.


&gt;<i> In Line 4, we have:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;code&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> [00o ] &#160;sqlite &#160;3.7.3 &#160; + &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2093k/3330k
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/code&gt;
</I>
The 2093k/3330k shows approximately where it was during
the download when augur last had a look at it.


&gt;<i> Presumably, we're talking about a spell called *00o* which requires the
</I>&gt;<i> *sqlite* spell as a dependancy (Req?). The particular version of
</I>&gt;<i> *sqlite* is 3.7.3
</I>
[OOo ] is explained in

# augur help scry

It is a visual representation of a bar graph in ASCII
instead of writing a percentage value.
It is not intended to be entirely accurate.
[OO  ] indicates half compilation complete.
However, that gives no clue about whether that is true
or how long the other half will require.
This functionality called &quot;estimation&quot; was requested by SAs.
It might not always be correct.
Most of the time it uses the amount of lines from a previous compile log
as a basis for how many compile lines to expect from the current cast
of that software project.


&gt;<i> What is the *+* sign for?
</I>
The + indicates that the time for those is growing larger.
It probably only shows + when software is compiling.

The - indicates that the event happened in the past.
The number follow the - indicates how long ago in the past
the event occurred.
The time is expressed in Days:Hours:Minutes format.
So if there is no : then it is just minutes.

The heads up display shows at the very top something expected for the future.
In the middle it shows what is currently happening.
Then, towards the bottom it shows what previously happened.
When an event has a description such as: Pass Cast
then it is an event that already occurred.
So from top to bottom it is future, present, past.


&gt;<i> Perhaps it has d/l'd 2093 of 3330 KBytes?
</I>
Yes that what a line indicating downloading.
Sometimes those show up.


&gt;<i> On Line 5 we have:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;code&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> [0. &#160;] &#160;fftw &#160; &#160;3.2.2 &#160; + &#160; &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; &#160; &#160;dft/simd
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/code&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here we have, presumably, a spell called *0.*, which requires the spell
</I>&gt;<i> *fftw*. fftw's version number is 3.2.2? Again, what is the plus sign for
</I>&gt;<i> in column four, and in column 5 there is the number *10*, but what does
</I>&gt;<i> that stands for?
</I>
No fftw is the spell.
The [O.  ] is a bar graph.
The bar graph fills from left to right.

&gt;<i> What *dft/simd* is in column six.
</I>
It is something that printed in the compile log.
# augur scry expects that may be it's current work directory
relative to the source tree.


&gt;<i> And also, where the other particulars that are listed may be of
</I>&gt;<i> significance too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, and the only source I could find was in the n00b faq, but are
</I>&gt;<i> the following still the preferred initial system configs to be
</I>&gt;<i> performed and in the order they are listed?:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.) `sorcery update grimoire`
</I>&gt;<i> 2.) run `sorcery` and set defaults
</I>&gt;<i> 3.) `augur sync`
</I>&gt;<i> 4.) `augur sync`
</I>&gt;<i> 5.) `augur &#160;update`
</I>&gt;<i> 6.) `sorcery rebuild`
</I>&gt;<i> 7.) `cast useful-profile`
</I>&gt;<i> 8.) `cast kde`
</I>&gt;<i> 9.) `cast firefox` # instead of Mozilla?
</I>&gt;<i> 10.) `augur forget etc; cast etc`
</I>&gt;<i> 11.) `augur forget glibc-locales; cast glibc-locales`
</I>&gt;<i> 12.) `augur forget glibc-localtime; cast glibc-localtime`
</I>&gt;<i> 13.) `augur forget init-toggle; cast init-toggle`
</I>&gt;<i> 14.) `augur forget sorcery-bgz; cast sorcery-bgz` # for small HDDs
</I>&gt;<i> 15.) `cast sorcery-bootblaze`
</I>&gt;<i> 16.) `cast sorcery-immune`
</I>&gt;<i> 17.) `cast sorcery-alien` &#160; &#160; &#160; # makes monthly cronjob
</I>&gt;<i> 18.) `cast sorcery-clean` &#160; &#160; &#160; # makes monthly cronjob
</I>&gt;<i> 16.) `cast sorcery-defrag` &#160; &#160; &#160;# makes monthly cronjob
</I>&gt;<i> 16.) `cast sorcery-md5sum` &#160; &#160; &#160;# makes weekly crontab job
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And finally, what might be the easiest way to find/install something
</I>&gt;<i> like, say, wireshark or transmission? One could try the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> cast wireshark; cast transmission; cast openshot; cast k3b (but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> know if those are the correct spellings for the spells to cast in order
</I>&gt;<i> to install wireshark or transmission - and I don't know if there even is
</I>&gt;<i> a spell for OpenShot [non-linear video editor] or if k3b has its own
</I>&gt;<i> spell or &#160;is part of another KDE thang...
</I>
List as many spells on cast as are desired to be cast such as:

# cast kde-v4 sorcery-immune sorcery-md5sum glibc-locales

augur commands must be run in sequence
A SA can either type:
# augur sync; augur newer; augur update
or
# augur easy


&gt;<i> Thanks :)
</I>
Sure.
Sorry if that seemed difficult.
The augur scry screen makes better sense
the more that a SA looks at it.
Because of the limited amount of character space in a console
there is not much point in trying to label the columns.
Most of the columns should be rather intuitive like the spell name column
and the version column.
The first and last columns are more dynamic.
The first column is a status column which might also show status
of an ongoing event as a bar graph.
The last column provides information about the event which might be
lines from the ongoing download log, or a line from the compile log
or a duration for the event or since the event took place.

Many of the augur commands provide verbose help when invoked like:

# augur help $COMMAND_NAME

where $COMMAND_NAME is the name of the command such as:
&quot;event&quot;

# augur help event

Like a HUD on an aircraft airspeed is indicated somewhere
if the pilot knows where to look, however the air number and/or
gauge that shows air speed might not have the word &quot;airspeed&quot; written on it.
So the augur scry, also called the HUD, short for heads up display,
is similar to an aircraft HUD in that it provides information in the spot
where the SA will look once familiar with where to look to find the
desired information.

Unfortunately, it can not show everything.
Compile logs are saved by default.
# augur compile $SPELL
Download logs are not saved by default.
It must be enabled as a feature.
Event logs are stored in /var/log/sorcery/event/
They can be viewed by various methods.
And some of them, which have a size greater than 0
will contain additional information as their file content.
