<PRE>That is an excellent point.
/boot is protected from reaping by dispel.
I forgot about that.
Thanks for the reminder.
Sorry about the inconvenience.

I fixed /etc/init.d/{initramfs,lilo,extlinux}
so that they will also check for /sbin/extlinux
I was using a check on /boot/extlinux/menu.c32
to ensure that syslinux was properly installed.
However, I did not consider the possibility
of someone installing syslinux and then uninstalling it.
That is because I transition boxes to extlinux rather than to lilo.

Unfortunately, the potential for supporting booting
with either lilo or extlinux turned into an implementation
that was slightly more complicated and problematic than intended.
I avoided every potential for failure during transitioning,
but not everyone achieved success on their first attempt.
When Evert mentioned a problem due to lilo being installed in the MBR,
I arrogantly expected that a stale or useless MBR
could be the only problem.

Fortunately, thanks to the excellent feedback
each potential for a failed transition can be identified and fixed.
I would be pleased if Sorcerer box is transitioned to extlinux.
That way I can deprecate the lilo method and remove the code.

Unfortunately, I must wait at least 2 years before considering
the possibility of removing support for lilo.
Deprecating support for lilo breaks boxes
that are unprepared for transitioning.
And most pre-compiled binary based distros
last no longer than 2 years before requiring re-deployment
from new Install/Rescue disks.

Since the switch away from lilo
can not be an automatic change
guaranteed to succeed on all boxes
it differs from the Sorcerer's policy of seamless updates.
Therefore, it might eventually become the next big break in Sorcerer.
And by &quot;big brake&quot; I am suggesting an event of transition
that is sufficiently significant as to require re-deployment of a box.

The former big break in Sorcerer happened because
I followed the recommendation from a SA
who insisted that gettext libraries must be installed.
This was dumb on my part because I knew glibc was sufficient
and yet was allowing the modification of the gettext spell.
However, the problem did not appear instantly.

Eventually, glibc's headers and gettext's libraries became incompatible.
I was able to remove gettext's libraries from all of my boxes.
And I rolled new I/R without gettext libraries installed.
Not every SA achieved success with repairing their box.
Many SAs decided that re-installing with a newer I/R
provided an easier and faster solution.
And some SAs quit using Sorcerer.
Some mistakes and/or transitions are painful like that.

In general Sorcerer has a decent history of dodging the bullet.
Every major distribution eventually releases
install images that are useless for deployment,
provides segfaulting ppp or segmentation faults in other essential utilities,
and derails their package manager or update system.
Fortunately, it happens infrequently with Sorcerer.

sorcery derailed only a few times.
gettext's library was a really big mistake.
multipathd's initial inclusion on I/Rs created
I/Rs that were useless for installation on SCSI boxes.
And the presence of a floppy disk device caused
a problem with using on old I/R.
And most recently there was a version of bind approved
in the grimoire which was did not work on deployed boxes.
Being without a recursive DNS resolver
is a considerable inconvenience.
Yet, I suppose we can add the transition to extlinux
as yet another Sorcerer blunder.
With as smoothly as the distribution has been progressing
perhaps we were just about due for another?

I have not made up my mind about deprecating lilo support.
Either way I  have 23 more months to consider it.
However, SAs that invest time to learn extlinux
and transition their boxes will gain several good benefits
and have nothing to fear if lilo support is discontinued.

If all the problems are identified and solved
then both can be made to work.
Sustaining lilo support is not without a potential benefit.
If either extlinux or lilo becomes unsupported and unusable
then the other option remains available.

Sometimes original software authors discontinue a project
and then nobody decides to host and maintain the software.
Debian provides a massive collection of software that
no longer hosted on external websites.
Sorcerer software policy differs.
When hosting and support stops for software
then the spells are eventually removed from the grimoire.

Sorry for the digression.
My point is that having a supported bootloader is good.
Having a choice is beneficial.

I hope the transition goes more smoothly for others
thanks to the fixes introduced from feedback.
Supporting both bootloaders is an ideal situation.
However, if problematic then the eventual discontinuation
of support for lilo would be the lesser of two evils.

Having everyone using the same bootloader makes
troubleshooting easier.
If we were all using different compilers
or merely different versions of gcc
then imagine the additional difficulty.
Many reported compile problems would not be distribution wide.

Obviously having choices is good.
Yet the more each box diverges
then the greater the probability of encountering
specific non-distribution wide problems.
Therefore support for 2 boot loaders is a mixed blessing.
However, the benefits of using extlinux as compared to lilo
seem too great to be ignored.
Hopefully, we can iron out the wrinkles together.
