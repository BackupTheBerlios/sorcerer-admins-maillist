Thanks.
That is a generous offer.
The DoD NIC might eventually want those IP address returned,
especially if not being used for military contract.
IPv4 addresses always seems to be in short supply.

To be straightforward
I irritate myself about both scarcity of IPv4 addresses and also the
method of DNS design.
It is for those reason that I would not register sorcerer
as a domain under a top level domain such as .com .org .net.

For the moment, Sorcerer is receiving the benevolence of Pekka Panula
and his company
which is providing for the expenses of the IP addresses, DNS, Internet
bandwidth, and hardware
for running Sorcerer services.
And compared to what modern computers can provide
Sorcerer's disk, memory, and CPU requirements are rarely more demanding
than an occasional rain shower over the ocean.
For that reason we can be pleased to graciously enjoy the benefit of
{archive,sorcerer,sources,spr}.silverice.org.
It may be less than an average compared to what a pre-compiled binary
based distro provides,
however Sorcerer services provide benefits that are unique and
beneficial to this distro's design.
Overall the benefits are significantly focused on providing sources
and expediting initial deployment.
Even while kernel.org and all mirrors went on a month long sabbatical
we enjoy being able to download sources
that were also being provided at sources.silverice.org
It may have been the best proof that having our own master source repository
saved SAs a considerable headache when a major host became unreachable.

What the distro lacks in website presentation
it somewhat compensates by providing useful services.
Having a mirror of those services is an excellent idea.
However, to discourage wasteful downloading/mirroring
httpd output was limited to allow only precise downloading
rather than directory listing.
Therefore, a secondary master source cache
must be generated on a virtual machine by a similar cronjob.
Therefore, that secondary master source cache would
download directly from original hosts and mirrors rather
than importing files from sources.silverice.org.

sorcerer.silverice.org is possible to mirror.
The service of spr.silverice.org and it's patches
probably aught not to be mirrored.
It is a dual service that consists of both requesting a patch
and having the patch generated and provided for downloading.
Consequently, a generated patch would not immediately
show at a mirror location.

Please report any findings about how Sorcerer runs under vmware.
Sorcerer runs adequately under VirtualBox.
Sorcerer runs admirably using qemu.
My guess is that qemu with the kvm module loaded
provides the best and most reliable virtual computing performance.

We should probably steer clear of sourceforge.
They deny hosting distributions while contrary proof
appeared in my tracking logs acquired with rsync.
Sourceforge refuses to host Sorcerer related files and services because
Sorcerer is a distro and sourceforge refuses to host distros;
although they clearly did host distros.

If we want a headache with a magnitude
greater than ibiblio.org + berlios.de combined
then sourceforge is definitely the way to go.
Consequently, I recommend sourceforge as the last and least consideration
for replacing the svn and email lists hosted at berlios.de.

Oh, for the record the names of the distro are now:
&quot;Sorcerer Modern Magic&quot;
and
&quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot;
I have yet to redo the website.
However, the same technology has been designed to provide
an experience that is nearly entirely different depending upon
the selection made by the person doing the installation.

&quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; provides an experience that is superior to a &quot;live CD.&quot;
A workstation suitable installation happens
and the installation automatically updates installed files periodically.
It is suitable for use by those who want a workstation,
but desire none of knowledge, power, nor responsibility of a SA.

&quot;Sorcerer Modern Magic&quot; provides the middle road experience
that is suitable for experienced SAs.
Nothing difficult is required; such as creating a workable kernel configuration.
Instead the tools; especially the immune system; attempt to cooperate with the
SA in order to keep the box updated and running smoothly
with the SA's selection of installed software.

Sorcerer Modern Magic is a splendidly simple and fun experience as compared
to the making one's own &quot;Linux From Scratch&quot; box according to the LFS book.
And yet the SA still retains nearly all the power of having their own distro.
The main concessions are:
init-scripts are provided by the distro;
cgroups instead of POSIX style resource management;
when booting with initramfs then the initramfs must be maintained in memory
although remains almost entirely swappable.
Those concessions are the foundation of the distro.
If anyone tries to change that
then that and the building may collapse.
And we have yet to forget the rough transition
to the LSB style init-scripts.
Our boxes would have been on the rocks for a week
or longer if not for Jan's assistance and insightful debugging.

Also we want to believe that booting a Sorcerer box
directly from fixed disk with a custom and near monolithic kernel
remains a possibility.
However, if nobody is doing it
then we do not know if the init-scripts are still suitable for it.
I suspect a strong possibility that booting without an initramfs
is part of Sorcerer's long lost legacy.

So basically, that is my opinion about
&quot;Sorcerer Sentient&quot; and &quot;Sorcerer Modern Magic&quot;

Thanks to effort from Evert and myself Sorcerer
made many significant improvements in 2011.

Without Evert the distro would lay quietly like a broken
egg while slowly rotting and stinking.
Evert does thorough testing after my testing
to ensure that a large selection of popular software
remains possible to compile following updates.
Everyone should know that as far as quality control goes
that Evert is the best!
And he posts almost all of his findings directly to me
instead of on the email list.
He is humble and considerate to not bother everyone about bugs.
And nobody other than me knows
exactly what an awesome effort he regularly contributes.

I seldom give thanks as frequently as I should.
However, we all owe Evert thanks
for the excellent quality of the Sorcerer grimoire during 2011.
Hip hip hurray!
