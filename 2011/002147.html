<PRE>Virtual consoles that are not running a getty
are eligible for receiving Xorg.
The tty or virtual console that each agetty runs on
is specified in /etc/inittab
However, Xorg, kdm, and gdm can allocate
an available virtual console automatically.

Many SAs expect that there are 12 virtual consoles.
However, there are more!
I know only a few of the nifty keys for navigating virtual consoles.
Usually, I use right and left arrow keys + alt
in order to descend and ascend the list of virtual consoles.
When sysinit and runlevel output
is directly to virtual consoles
then those virtual consoles appear when using
alt-arrow keys to look around,
although no program nor getty
is connected to those virtual console.
That seems both convenient and unexpected.

Both /etc/init.d/{gdm,kdm-v4} can be started during boot.
The gnome GUI login is available from one virtual console
and a KDM login is available from another virtual console.
However, I am uncertain which achieves dominance and appears first.

Running both gdm and kdm concurrently makes possible
an easy selection of the user's preference
on library computers and in computer labs.
The problem however is that the GUI
or console login prompt might not be authentic
Nefarious people sometimes create programs that impersonate
the actual login screen so that someone inputs their credentials.
The program logs the info, terminates
and then the real getty or GUI login appears.
Until we have some method of authenticating a login screen
then the best method is probably to login using a guest account
and then su to one's user account or then log out and log back in.
Oops, sorry, that was a total digression.
Yet the topic of security was on my mind.

A couple hours earlier I added instructional comments to
/etc/init.d/{halt,reboot}
They explain how to use the init-script's configuration file
in order to disable the count down timer and/or disallow
rebounding to a runlevel.
That way security can be tightened when
untrusted people are expected to be in proximity
or if the computer is designated for kiosk duty.

I was twitching over the potential for granting a non root person
the ability to change the runlevel by pressing ctrl-alt-delete.
I nearly put a root password prompt on it.
But instead I decided to just add instructions
that explain how to disable the potentially risky convenience.
And now I can rest with ease.  :)

P.S.

Remember not to directly login as root
on a virtual console nor on a graphic login manager
unless it is a personal computer that nobody else uses.
Otherwise a box's root credentials could be stolen
by someone with a user account who previously logged into that box.
The best way to go root is to execute
$ su -
or stay seated at one's own comfortable desk
and travel by the ssh train on the TCP/IPv4 track.
And anyone who knows the root password
should have the their ~/.bash_history symbolic linked to /dev/null
That way the root password can never accidentally appear in
their shell command history file.

I am feeling paranoid tonight.
And since I am polite
I will bring enough to share with everyone.  :)
