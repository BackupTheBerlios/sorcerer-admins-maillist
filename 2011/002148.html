<PRE>sorcerer-x86_64 contains both ELF 64-bit and ELF 32-bit libraries.
Nearly all of the installed machine executable programs are 64-bit.
However, where useful both ELF 64-bit and ELF 32-bit executable
programs are provided.
Therefore, this installation is not excessively heavy
as compared to having a separate and pure
x86_64 and IA32 installations of Sorcerer.
Rather this installation provides the best of both.
Boxes are able to run ELF 32-bit executable files
when ELF 64-bit versions of software can not be compiled or acquired,
which can be the situation with pre-compiled commercial software.
To re-state all of the above in a single sentence;
this is the Sorcerer x86_64 multilib I/R.

sorcerer-i686-SMP is for 80686 class CPUs with multi-core CPUs.
Although it can boot and be installed on x86_64 CPUs,
the multilib I/R may be preferred merely for a larger memory address
range that is possible with x86_64.
This I/R also boots and is usable
on most if not all 80686 class CPUs
which also have the PAE support.

sorcerer-i686-UP is the Install/Rescue image
that I expected to be able to retire.
It is nearly identical to the sorcerer-i686-SMP I/R.
However, this I/R's kernel's config differs.

Only the first core on a SMP CPU is detected and used.
No more than 4G of installed RAM is detected and used.
Technically this is a uni-processor kernel
that does not require a CPU with PAE support.

This image exists only for the sole purpose
of installation on PentiumM microprocessors
that came on centrino laptops from the Carmel patforms.
The lack of PAE on that CPU was a rare blunder which
might make those laptops a rare collectors item someday.
Although linux can be configured to boot and run on it;
most modern distributions consider a non PAE CPU a paperweight,
because from start of the 808686 class CPU
with the Pentium Pro and forward
all modern CPUs, except perhaps the PentiumM,
have PAE support.

The Sorcerer-i686-UP I/R was requested.
At least one SA must request this I/R each year.
Otherwise I will discontinue providing it.

For the moment a PentiuM CPU with at least 1G of 400Mhz RAM
runs Sorcerer decently as a mobile workstation
and can play streaming video in the web browser.
When it can be acquired cheaply
then this notebook is far from a total loss,
although it has less power than a modern mini-notebook.

These I/R images contain updated installed software,
linux-firmware to drive nearly device that the linux kernel can,
and improvements to the Sorcerer init system
that were discussed in a recent email.

For SAs eager to begin
then here are the convenient hyperlinks.

As usual these are thoroughly tested,
however please report bugs.
Good luck.
