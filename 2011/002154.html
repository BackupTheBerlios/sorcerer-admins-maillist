Really?
The cause for that might be difficult to discover.
The Linux-PAM spell does not contain code
to un-comment the portion of the config file
that is required for selinux support.
After grepping the grimoire
I feel certain that no other spell uncomments
that section of system-auth.
Yet there must be some reason that explains how it happened.

Oh, but wait the reason is not that it has changed.
The reason is that it has not changed.

I am not certain how it became that way.
But it might have still allowed Linux-PAM to work
when logging in from the real root file system
or while the selinux related spells were installed.

Seems that the solution is to use the stock
/etc/pam.d/system-auth
And to dispel selinux related software.
libselinux and libsepol and maybe something else
should be dispelled.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
Since nobody wanted the selinux sub-project to continue
I had not expected that any boxes exist that might
still be configured to use those libraries
or have /etc/pam.d/system-auth configured to use selinux.


&gt;<i> It was only the (s)ulogin at the reboot prompt that would allow me in
</I>&gt;<i> to fix this glaring error.
</I>
So that was useful?  :)  *lol*
Not that I wanted this type of problem,
but it does demonstrate that Sorcerer's init
has become more robust as to allow the SA
to solve the problem without having to boot
with kernel parameter rdinit=/bin/bash


&gt;<i> Also, never once this year have I been able to rebuild my system and
</I>&gt;<i> just log in with no problems.... NVIDIA_Linux_x86_64 just does not
</I>&gt;<i> have a module in the initramfs that works..
</I>
Perhaps that began when I changed NVIDIA-Linux spells?
The old spell used to crack open the archive or whatever NVIDIA provides.
Then it ran the make files and did all the installation from the spell.
However, Evert stated his preference for using NVIDIA's installer program.
So the NVIDIA-Linux* spells were redesigned
in order to use NVIDIA's installer.
That would settle all debate about whether
NVIDIA's installed file load out is complete.

Unfortunately, NVIDIA's installer is more than slightly broke
which is why there are two NVIDIA-Linux-* spells now.

Looking at the NVIDIA-Linux* spells I see that
the spell acquires the version
for the installed spell that is providing linux-kernel.
And it passes that to the installer using parameters:

--kernel-source-path=/usr/src/linux
--kernel-install-path=$DESTDIR/lib/modules/$LVER/kernel/drivers/video
--kernel-name=$LVER

And that should be used by NVIDIA's installer
in order to install the proper linux kernel module
in the proper location.
Yet if it does not work
then that is probably a bug that is owned by NVIDIA.

I rather continue using NVIDIA's installer
if for no other reason
than to not have to open their &quot;package&quot;
and spend hours discovering how to properly
implement a manual installation of it.
If something about the installed files changes
then using NVIDIA's installer program
will probably most eloquently adapt to the change
rather than requiring that the NVIDIA-* spells be rewritten.


&gt;<i> Only after I cast it twice and reboot twice does it start to work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is also the case for a kernel upgrade.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Need to reboot once with the new kernel, then build the nvidia kernel
</I>&gt;<i> module and get it on the initramfs... then only will X start working
</I>&gt;<i> for me again...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a bit of a pain.
</I>
I agree.
However, I am uncertain whether the problem still exists.
Seems as I have been able to do a kernel upgrade
then reboot and have xorg start without a complaint.
I will make a note to test explicitly for this problem
the next time I do a kernel upgrade.
If it exists then it should be reported to NVIDIA.
If not then they already fixed it.

Oh, I am in luck.
As usual the day after I release new I/Rs
and a newer linux kernel is already available for download.
So I can test for this problem today.  :)
