/bin/setsid comes from util-linux.
I do not know which version of util-linux introduced it.

</I>
No /bin/setsid on the I/R images?
Hmm, that would make that first update an adventure.
Guess I should make the devel to stable sorcery
and new I/Rs a reality ASAP.

</I>
Yes, the jump between that grimoire version
and the required sorcery to process it is huge.
However, the next spell to cast
after the grimoire is the sorcery spell.
The sorcery spell should not be a problem to cast.


&gt;<i> I used lynx, grabbed the latest sorcery (since I know these often come

</I>&gt;<i> xz, like the file extension - clever :)
</I>
Yes.  Probably there is an xz on the I/R.
p7zip probably would not be of any use
for extracting an xz file.
I expect that xz does come on the I/R
because the archive directory is full
of xz compressed archives.
So at least that should not be a problem.


&gt;<i> This one had the correct modules fro the kernel, so I was able to

</I>
&gt;<i> Oh ya /usr/libexec/sorcery/leech can't find /bin/setsid &#160;nor can cast
</I>&gt;<i> ... so I guess that's where I'm stuck.
</I>
It is inconvenient but not difficult to fix.
Locate all /bin/setsid in /usr/libexec/sorcery/*
and just remove the /bin/setsid and leave the
remainder of the command.
That should probably work for now
until newer util-linux is installed.


&gt;<i> okay I guess there is a download happening - but it's not appearing on
</I>&gt;<i> augur scry &#160;(148 wait 1 download 132 aquire) 3 at the top are [wait]

</I>&gt;<i> *shrug* I guess I can try and make some things go.... but I'm gone for now
</I>

Seems as if the I/R's util-linux installs setsid as:
/usr/bin/setsid

That also could be discovered by running:
$ which setsid

I suppose for now I can remove the absolute
path name for invoking it in the utils and
that should solve the problem.

Thanks for the report.
