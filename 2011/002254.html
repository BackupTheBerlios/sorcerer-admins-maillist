Preparation is required before bootlogd can be started.
/dev is required, because /dev/pts is required, because /dev/ptmx is required.
The order during sysinit is not exactly proper.
/etc/init.d/ptmx should not start until after /etc/init.d/udevsettle completes.
Yet if made proper then nearly half the init-scripts of sysinit
run before /etc/init.d/bootlogd

&gt;<i> Most of it is, though, and it was especially useful during my udev

</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> However, there is almost no init-scripts in sysinit

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that would not sacrifice something important.
</I>&gt;<i> This is true. Pity that udev needs to be restarted later, though. Is

</I>
Actually, /dev and all virtual file systems exist both
on the initramfs file system and are also bound to
the commensurate location in /media/root/
where the real root file system exists.
The reason for restarting udev during run levels
is to have udev run on the real root file system.
The reason udev must run on the real root file system
is because some hot pluggable support is only available
on the real root file system.

For example /lib/udev/rules.d/97-bluetooth.rules
is a rule for starting /usr/sbin/bluetoothd

Obviously, /usr/sbin/ is not provided on the initramfs.
And even if bluetoothd is moved to /sbin/
and provided on the initramfs
then bluetoothd still has an ELF library requirement
on /usr/lib64/libdbus-1.so.3
So even if /usr/lib64/libdbus-1.so.3 is moved to
/lib64/ the rest of dbus must be moved and
then dbus must be started on the initramfs.

If we allow such chain reactions to cause the migration
of software to the initramfs
then eventually we will encounter some helper application
or daemon started by udevd that required xorg libraries.
And that might be solved by having that program statically
link with the libraries that it requires.
However, if success is eventually achieved
then a serious amount of software must exist on the initramfs
which makes the initramfs considerably larger,
and requires additional init-scripts run during sysinit.

If the goal of the initramfs is the mounting and transition to
the real root file system
then we must concede that the udev started on the initramfs
and cold plug events that are re-triggered
can properly run only most yet not all of the udev rules.

&gt;&gt;<i> If someone has ideas about how the num lock light
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should indicate something useful during booting
</I>&gt;<i> The numlock light should really indicate whether numlock is active.
</I>&gt;<i> :)
</I>
Actually, it does.
The init scripts really do enable and disable num lock
rather than merely turn the led on.
However, it can only do so for the virtual console
that is running the init-script.
Therefore, running an init-script in a terminal emulation program
will not change the state of num lock for the terminal emulation program.
Or more simply xorg's method for controlling the state of numlock and caplock
differs from linux kernel virtual terminals.


&gt;<i> However, you could make it flash if sysinit detects a hanging process?
</I>
Someone might confuse that with some sort of failure indicated by
the BIOS of the motherboard.
However, the idea is somewhat interesting and perhaps useful.

The nice aspect about the Sorcerer sysinit which
runs nearly exclusively only what is required to achieve
the outcome of a successful mount of a real root file system
is that sysinit appears to never hang on Sorcerer.
However, SAs have reported that problems with udev
can cause an udevsettle to run the entire length of the timeout.
That would not be a hang, but rather merely an excessive delay.

Due the unlikely potential that sysinit could hang
a getty login is provided on virtual console #7.
The SA can log in even before sysinit completes.
Regular getty logins become available for login
after sysinit completes and before runlevels begin.
Consequently, there is almost no time when root login
to a Sorcerer box becomes impossible.

Rarely Sorcerer hangs during runlevel execution.
Sometimes the hang goes unnoticed if enough
of the runlevel init-scripts complete.
Consequently, a hang during runlevel might only
be noticed by &quot;prc&quot; remaining on the process list
an hour after booting.

Yet if hangs were to be automatically detected
then what should be the outcome?
I am voting against blinking the num lock or cap lock lights.
That indicates too little and seems too similar
to a motherboard indicated error.

However, a message could be written to /dev/console.
Automatic identification of the potentially hung process could be inaccurate.

udevsettle might appear to hang.
fsck might appear to hang.
raid synchronization might appear to hang.
password input for encrypted file systems might appear to hang.

Consequently, any decision about whether to automatically kill
a process must give consideration to the process being killed.
Yet would automatic hang prevention enabled during sysinit/runlevel
be a useful improvement?
Or should merely a message be printed about
what appears to be happening along with instructions
that the SA can log in on virtual console #7 and investigate?
And if an automatic kill is allowed
then how long to wait?
5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes?

&gt;<i> During most of the boot process my USB keyboard is not even
</I>&gt;<i> initialized, so I don't have anything to say about keys being pressed
</I>&gt;<i> during the sysinit process.
</I>
Usually, within BIOS/CMOS exists an option for the BIOS
to emulate a PS/2 style keyboard connection with a USB keyboard.
That is useful to enable on laptops.
That way the USB keyboard works even before udev
has a chance to enable the USB subsystem and
load the required modules.

However, to regress to the previous topic...
If hanging during boot is possible
then an automatic method to detect and kill
a process might be useful on boxes that are
intended to reboot entirely without interaction.
Better to have the box eventually permit
sshd logins short while running without a few processes
rather than to never complete booting.

Technically, an enhancement to prevent indefinite hanging during booting
can be added as a Sorcerer Sentinel rather
than as a significant modification to the existing boot methods.
Consequently, if we can all agree upon what is safe and desirable
then running the implementation can be made optional.

Thanks for the feedback Evert.
Good way to keep the ball rolling.

What programs aught to be excluded from an automatic kill
when a potential hang situation is detected?
/sbin/fsck
/bin/mount
and process tree with dialog when dialog was started with a timeout parameter?
