<PRE>I spent time experimenting with alternate methods for pre-loading the
kernel cache.
I am keeping the new methods experimental
and not distributing them distribution wide.
However, I upgraded immune-boot-blaze.

immune-boot-blaze now requires file systems mounted with atimes enabled.
atimes will not cause as much disk wear and tear
when file systems have commit values of 10 minutes or more.
And atimes can provide some benefits.

The log files for immune-boot-blaze are now stored in /var/tmp/boot-blaze.
Accessing the log files requires a bit more system overhead,
but is easier to create, manage, audit, update, etc...

And the detection time for adding files to the pre-cache
increased from 5 minutes to 15 minutes.
That gives ample time for a leisurely login
and for starting programs such as firefox.

For those who do not already know
immune-boot-blaze is a Sorcerer specific enhancement.
It provides faster booting, faster login, faster program start.
The enhanced performance is achieved by
fully tasking the disk device to load into the kernel cache
content from all the files that are anticipated to be useful.
Succinctly, it learns from a previous boot
what to anticipate and load for the current boot.

What difference does it make?
Data gathered from a real computer showed that
loading firefox without previously running it requires 10 seconds.
Running firefox, exiting, then running it again
opens the web browser window in approximately 2 seconds.
Therefore, having the required files already in the kernel cache
saves approximately 8 seconds.
By pre-caching anticipated files
immune-boot-blaze can return those 8 seconds and more
by providing faster login and faster process starting.

The next best alternative is to have firefox start as one's xsession begins.
But that will still not give back the 8 seconds.
It merely reduces the latency introduced
by the user manually starting the process.

What immune-boot-blaze does is to utilize
all those moments where the disk would be idle
in order to preemptively read anticipated files.
immune-boot-blaze is like the person who telephone's their meal request
to a restaurant before driving there to receive takeout food.
Consequently, the time spent driving
is also multi-tasked to preparing the meal.
Makes good sense.
And that is what immune-boot-blaze does.
