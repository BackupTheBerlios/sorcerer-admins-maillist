500M still seems enormous to me!
So yes, I agree that a 1G /boot seems more than generous.
With 5 labels I anticipate that a 1G /boot is currently
barely sufficient to support the /boot/*/initrf.old.
When the initrf grows to be a bit larger
then the potential benefit of /boot/*/initrf.old will be sacrificed.

I anticipate that a 1G /boot will continue to be usable
for a long time at the present rate of growth for /boot
However, sometimes there are unexpected leaps forward
in space usage such as the inclusion of linux-firmware
instead of using individual spells to provide specific firmware.
Also for as long as linux retains options to prune
potentially unwanted sections from the linux kernel compilation
then that technique can reduce consumption of space on /boot

For example,

# cat /etc/sorcery/log/opt.on/linux
:<i>OMIT_ATM_DRIVERS:
</I>:<i>OMIT_WAN:
</I>:<i>OMIT_NETDEV_10000:
</I>:<i>OMIT_INFINIBAND:

# ls -lah /boot/2.6.39.1/{linux,initrf*}
-rw------- 1 root root  62M Jun  3 08:34 /boot/2.6.39.1/initrf
-rw------- 1 root root  62M Jun  3 07:08 /boot/2.6.39.1/initrf.old
-rw------- 1 root root 1.7M Jun  3 06:43 /boot/2.6.39.1/linux

And a SA can manually remove old /boot/$VERSION and /lib/modules/$VERSION
directories and run /etc/init.d/lilo
in order to further minimize usage.
And initramfs regeneration can be forced with
/etc/init.d/initramfs force
Also the SA can gzip /boot/*/initrf
and rename it without the .gz extension
in order to conserve a bit of space.

# time gzip -3 initrf

real    0m10.470s
user    0m10.289s
sys     0m0.140s

# ls -lah initrf.gz /boot/2.6.39.1/initrf
-rw------- 1 root root 62M Jun  3 08:34 /boot/2.6.39.1/initrf
-rw------- 1 root root 39M Jun  4 04:33 initrf.gz

That was at 800 MHz 400MHz bus speed with light compression.
We can see compression made a difference.
The difference seems more significant than usual because
the initramfs already contained an incomplete selection of linux modules.
If SAs request it then changes can be made to
/etc/init.d/initramfs
that allow the SA request that initramfs images are compressed.
It would save about 20M per each initramfs image.
However, the compressed image, in the above example,
now requires an addition 40M for a box to boot.
That is because the compressed initramfs and kernel image
are loaded into memory and then the kernel must uncompress
the initramfs image before providing it on rootfs.

On a deployed box only the linux modules are compressed.
That is because the modules can be compressed merely once
and not require compression each time an initramfs is generated.
On the Sorcerer I/R the linux modules are not compressed.
Instead the entire initramfs image is xz compressed.
The I/R's initramfs allows for faster downloading of the I/R.
A deployed box's uncompressed initramfs with compressed modules
allows for faster boot and lower memory consumption.

The above demonstrates that
I am bending in both directions
to allow the SA more benefits
than could be acquired without compression.
As always the compromises can be adjusted.
Conserving more space on /boot requires that
/etc/init.d/initramfs requires longer to run.

As it stands Sorcerer boxes use considerable space on /boot
because it enables a considerably fast boot
with an extravagant and potentially useful initramfs.
The amount of dots printed is not excessive
while lilo loads the initramfs.
And since the initramfs is not decompressed
then there is almost no delay
from when linux begins until /init runs.

For the moment I like the balance.
I rather waste 20% more space on /boot
rather than have slower initramfs generation and slower booting.
But this is merely my preference.
If a SA requests then I will adjust /etc/init.d/initramfs to allow
SAs to specify compression.
If I select the compression automatically
then the best possible compromise would be a level of gzip compression
where the CPU can compress nearly as fast as the the data can be read from disk.
In that event the creation of an initramfs without the benefit of cached data
would require nearly the same amount of time regardless of providing
compression.
Unfortunately, boot time would differ.
However, gzip uncompression would be fastest for the kernel.

I do not know if anyone clearly remembers
the earlier I/R from the start of this year and earlier versions.
They provided a bzip2 compressed initramfs.
And there was a significant delay
while the kernel decompressed the initramfs.

The current compromise allows boxes to shutdown without
appearing to hang during initramfs regeneration
and to boot without appearing to hang from an initramfs decompression.
Yet we pay for that speed by providing a nice large /boot/
This we can adjust to some extent.
However, a large /boot remains somewhat of a necessity since
Sorcerer provides excellent fluffy initramfs images.

As usual this is open to debate.
What is ideal remains subjective.
I will try to make adjustments according to SA feedback.
However, a /boot smaller than 1G will not be possible.
I can give no assurance that such boxes
will not eventually fail to boot.
However, as usual I will give notice when /boot usage is on the rise.
That way boxes that were adequately prepared will endure.
As for my boxes that had 256M /boot partitions,
I re-partitioned those a long time ago.
My boxes now have either no /boot or a 2G /boot
However, a 1G /boot should be survivable.
I recommend running df on it and monitor
exactly how close it come to the limit.

For example:

# df /boot
Filesystem     1K-blocks   Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1        2064208 650404   1308948  34% /boot

3 labels, each with initrf.old and an additional rescue label.
The files still fragment, but not terribly so.
As we can see this /boot is in no danger overflow.

And that is what we want to see.
There is room for growth and room for performance.
Hopefully, 2G /boot will continue to provide plenty of space even in 2038.
However, I am not betting on it.

I hope that helps further demystify the 2G /boot
With compressed initramfs images
Sorcerer could not manage on a smaller /boot.
However, expectations and performance and growth
require reasonable expectations.
When I first recommended 2G for /boot
what I was really thinking was,
&quot;1G should be sufficient for a while
so best to double the recommendation.&quot;

Probably our 2G /boot partitions will not reach even 66% full this year.
However, that is not a bad thing.
That is a good thing!
Having free space on /boot relaxes our woes
about whether we must re-partition.

Boxes that can not afford 2G on /boot
can go ext3 or ext4 entirely for /
with no fancy LVM2 nor mdadm.
That way lilo can be installed in the boot block of /
and will have no problem mapping the blocks
for linux and initramfs images.
Therefore, to /boot or not to /boot
depends very much on what the SA
decides to do with /
/boot is something that was forced upon SAs.
It was their choice.

I want to say in conclusion that because Sorcerer is a distribution
that progresses seamlessly from past to present to future
that when deploying a /boot then a 2G /boot
makes good sense to avoid future growing pains.
If Sorcerer was a pre-compiled binary based distro
then we would all be doing backups, re-partitioning,
and doing complete fresh re-installations
every year or every other year.
But we are spared that agony.
Consequently, we must pay for it by being generous
in the space we allocate to partitions.
A 2G /boot probably seems excessive for any distro.
However, for the Sorcerer design
a 2G /boot is the outcome of adequate forethought.
