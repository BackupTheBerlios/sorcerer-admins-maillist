<PRE>Windows emulated the Apple Macintosh GUI
and arrived riding the coat-tails of DOS.
The cheaper 80x86 hardware combined
with consumer ignorance of other operating systems
helped create market domination.
Basically, people without computer experience
were buying computers and wanted their computers
to do something useful or entertaining.
And for that they required an operating system.

Tandy corporation also realized this and were selling
their computers with Tandy DOS and deskview which
was something like an office suite during the early 1980s.
I owned a Tandy 1000 SX
Was not a bad computer.
16 color graphics, precursor to 256 color MCGA,
had the same sound chip as a commodore 64,
and was faster the a 4.77 MHz 8088 and PC Jr..
It was somewhat like a fast PC Jr.
yet without the wireless nonsense.
But they discontinued competition.

The majority of uses of a Windows operating systems
never tried a different operating system.
&gt;<i>From that perspective is &quot;popular&quot;
</I>a suitable word for for describing Windows.

I remember seeing the versions of Windows prior to 95.
It ran on top of DOS, yet provide some games, eye candy,
and multi-tasking ability.
It seem superior to DOS
and that was as much contrast as many people had back then.
