<PRE>I recently gave a nickname to the Sorcerer's initramfs.
I call it the keep of the Sorcerer's castle.
The name is appropriate in many ways.

However, thus far the potential of the keep is mostly untapped.
After booting completes only /sbin/init and /sbin/agetty continue
running from the keep.
I was discussing with Evert that perhaps udev should remain running on the keep
and that also the system logger program should run from the keep.

Processes running in the keep have both benefits and drawbacks.
First, the process is not likely to be reading or writing to files that exist
on a filesystem attached to a physical device.
Therefore, processes running from the keep
are unlikely to become zombies or freeze
in the event of a serious disk or serious file system error.
However, if the system logger runs from the keep
then it would write files to a tmpfs that would also be bound
somewhere in /var/log/ so that it can be viewed from both places.
No inconvenience with that.

The first and most obvious drawback is that the system logs eat swap.
A box that keeps a years worth of system logs,
without rebooting, might eat a lot of swap.
Apparently, that is not a problem with metalog.
Also if a box reboots or shutdown unexpectedly rather
than using the proper method
then the content of the logs would be lost.
The most obvious method to avoid that is
to have the system logger also output over the network
to a logger listening on a different box.
And at least 9 out of 10 times when a box loses power suddenly
there is no clue in the on disk system log as to what happened.
Lost system logs could be annoying for other reasons,
but on a box operating perfectly normal
then a system log would not be lost.

Switching udev to running from keep I have mostly decided upon.
Whether or not to switch system loggers is yet undecided.
I pose the question on the list in order to gather insight from Sorcerer SAs.
Some SAs might know reasons for why that change would be very undesirable.
In contrast, I prefer a system log that runs
no-matter-what-except-sudden-power-loss.  :)

Since Sorcerer boxes use the keep both during boot and shutdown
we should also consider what process we want
to start and continue running on the keep.
For example, the keep is currently inaccessible when we ssh into a box.
But what if sshing into the box is not working?
Might we want to be able to ssh into the keep?
So should sshd also be running on the keep
but accessible on a different port?
Maybe TCP port 30 since it lacks an assignment in /etc/services ?

No matter what new bugs may lay siege
to a box when installed software is updated;
the keep remains as potential last point of retreat.
It is a zone of safety from which problems
can be carefully examined and solved
without being mired in the battlefield on /media/root/

So how should we fortify the keep?
Besides ssh and scp
what other useful programs and libraries
should be moved into the keep?
What processes should be started in the keep and remain running?

Since the initramfs is being retained as the central &quot;keep&quot; of our
Sorcerer's castle
we should grown accustomed to the idea that it is a valid file system
for running
processes, daemons, and services.
What benefits most from running inside the keep?
What deserves the honor?

Thanks for making a moment to consider it.
No urgent requirement to rack one's brain.
For over a decade the initrd and initramfs was considered
a filesystem to be discarded after booting.
That habit of thought is not easily discarded.
Yet if something useful pops into mind
then please share it.
