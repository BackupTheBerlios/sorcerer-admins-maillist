<PRE>Of course Sorcerer boxes will not be the fastest booting distro.
That is a given compromise because
Sorcerer provides a rich and useful initramfs.
However, a while back there was discussion
about making Sorcerer's init faster.
And it remained on my todo list until recently.

Sorcerer's parallel init works by grouping init-scripts into sublevels.
All init-scripts in a sublevel begin executing concurrently.
After all init-scripts in the sublevel complete
then the init-scripts in the next sublevel begin.

This method is easy and uncomplicated to implement
while providing a moderate gain in speed.
However, it was criticized because a single slow init-script
could delay progression to the next sublevel.

I recently implemented a very simple modification
that allows some init-scripts to declare themselves as fast.
It might be an oxymoronic choice of words,
because init-scripts that declare themselves fast
might be among the slowest to start.
However, this declaration permits
the init-script to run without delaying
the progression to the next sublevel.
Here is a list of init-scripts that were given the &quot;fast&quot; declaration:

cups
dhcpd
gdm
boot-blaze
sentinel-memory
sentinel-resume
sentinel-space
sentinel-sync
swap
kdm-v4
fancontrol
sensord
sensors
metalog
mysqld
slapd
sshd
postgresql
shishid
smartd
xdm

And here is an example of how it works.
Please consider:

# ls /etc/rc.d/rc4.d | tail -n 20
S02cups
S02dbus-daemon
S02dhcpd
S02fancontrol
S02kdm-v4
S02mysqld
S02named
S02nscd
S02ntpd
S02sensord
S02shishid
S02slapd
S02snd-seq-oss
S02ssh-keygen
S03alsactl
S03avahi-daemon
S03metalog
S03sshd
S04avahi-dnsconfd
S04smartd

In the above selection of ordered symbolic links to init scripts
we can see that kdm-v4 runs on sublevel S02
kdm-v4 might require considerable time before it returns.
However, sublevel S03 will begin without waiting for kdm-v4 to complete.
We also know that cups mysql and dhcpd are also declared to be fast.
Therefore, the completion of those scripts do not generate a delay
before beginning runlevel S03.

This compromise maintains a simple implementation
and yet permits utilizing many installed CPU cores.
It does not introduce additional overhead, monitoring, scanning, nor looping.
Consequently, it might be faster than an attempt at perfect parallelism.
init-scripts still start in proper order
and when necessary they complete in proper order.

Does this new speed advantage comes at a cost in performance or functionality?
Neither is sacrificed.
The outcome of running the init-script
still writes the error code or empty file within /var/log/init/
And the output of the init-script is captured in the console log
/var/log/console

Do sysinit init-scripts run in parallel?
The sysinit init-scripts do not run in parallel.
This is because sysinit init-scripts execute quickly
or are extremely order sensitive.
Most of the sysinit init-scripts {,un}load a module or mount a virtual
file system.
However, /etc/init.d/udevtrigger generates a workload of coldplug events
that udevd completes with parallel process.
udevtrigger does not delay the completion of sysinit.
sysinit init-scripts continue executing until /etc/init.d/udevsettle runs.
udevrtrigger and fsck are tasks with parallelism.
That gains speed during execution of sysinit.
However, any attempt at parallelizing the execution of sysinit init-scripts
would not gain even a second faster boot speed.
That is why parallel init-script execution only happens during runlevel 2 and 4.
