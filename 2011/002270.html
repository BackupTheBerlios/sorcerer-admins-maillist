<PRE>If there was a question about who to ask when I am busy
then definitely ask Evert first.
However, for the question about the new email list location
then I also do not know the answer.
I spent the last 3 days working on the gnome 3.2.0 and kde 4.7.2 update.
Such things are not easy.
The software does not merely fall into place.
The new spells do not appear in the grimoire magically.
Someone must allocate significant time and effort to this task.
And so I volunteered 3 days of effort, just like that.

The task of setting up new hosting resources should be relatively simple.
Therefore, it is a good task to delegate to someone
since the expected time to accomplish is less than 1 day's effort.
However, my time is already allocated to the task of updates
since I can probably accomplish those faster and easier than anyone.
Yet I still have several important outstanding tasks on my todo list
such as rewriting the bind spell
so that bind can be updated to the newest version.
After that I want to roll and test new I/Rs
and generate new archives for the Sorcerer Sentient installation
since KDE has upgraded to a newer version.
With a bit of luck this can happen next week.
I am happily anticipating testing a fun improvement to the next I/R
that will be potentially useful in a low security environment.

Additionally, besides adding the &quot;limited&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; domains for
immune-security-tomoyo
I have only added one custom domain for ntp.
Much more can be done to enhance security with tomoyo if/when time permits.
The modifications to gdm and kdm init-scripts for having those services started
in the limited domain was accomplished last month.
Therefore, the next update should distribute it.
Good for that.
Now if a new linux kernel would appear
then everyone can update to a kernel that
has compiled in support for tomoyo.

Unless I want to brag more
then I should probably resume productivity.
If anyone wants to contribute
then send an email while the lists still work.  :)
