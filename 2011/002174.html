<PRE>I am adjusting the default /etc/ssh/sshd_config
so that sshd will use PAM.
This has an important security consequence.
While the root password remains empty
sshd listening on port 22 allow remote root login without a password.
The proper solution is setting the root password or stopping sshd.

The reason for this change is to provide enhanced
cgroup functionality for users who log in via getty and ssh.

I usually prefer to skip technical explanations.
However, this is worth understanding.
Let us start by examining a simple scenario.

Romeo and Juliet log into the same idle uni-processor box.
Juliet starts one process that runs full bore.
Romeo starts 3 processes that run full bore.
Should Romeo receive 3 times as many CPU cycles as Juliet?
With the POSIX model of provisioning;
processes individually compete
for CPU cycles based upon priority, real-time, and nice.
That makes competing for resources on POSIX
somewhat like a corewars game.

However, the addition of cgroup resource provisioning in linux
allows processes to compete for the CPU as teams or groups.
However, the word &quot;cgroup&quot; is used instead of the words team or group.
Now replay the above scenario.

Romeo's cgroup is called romeo.
All of Romeo's processes are automatically added
to the romeo cgroup's task list.
Likewise Juliet's one process is added to the juliet cgroup's task list.
Consequently, Juliet's 1 process receives 50% of available CPU cycles.
And Romeo's 3 proccesses each receive 16.66% of available CPU cycles.
Finally, each user can receive their fair share!

In order to make this happen I adjusted Linux-PAM and openssh spells.
Unless I adjust the location where the cgroup file system is mounted,
which is something I ponder every day,
then user's will receive their cgroup assignment such as:

/dev/cgroup/user/romeo
/dev/cgroup/user/juliet
/dev/cgroup/user/shakespeare

Daemons started during init will receive cgroup assignment such as:

/dev/cgroup/daemon/sshd
/dev/cgroup/daemon/kdm-v4

And the processing of spells receive cgroup assignments such as:

/dev/cgroup/sorcery/cast/gtk+
/dev/cgroup/sorcery/leech/linux

So as we can see the three major cgroup factions are:
daemon; user; sorcery
Currently, the daemon and user factions receive equal shares.
However, the sorcery faction receives diminished shares of
the CPU and file system I/O
Consequently, sorcery can be causing a high loadavg
and yet user and daemon processes continue running
so fast that performance loss seems invisible.

Naturally, SA can adjust cgroup provision as desired.
When adjusting a single user's provisioning
then the provisioning can be maintained until reboot
by creating a sub cgroup for that user.
That is because a cgroup can not be removed
until it has no sub-cgroups
and no processes remains on the cgroup's task list.

More fun stuff is planned for cgroup and enhancing init.
However, this part which contains the security caveat
deserves advance explanation.
It should only effect SAs while deploying new boxes
and also neglecting the most basic step of setting a root password.
