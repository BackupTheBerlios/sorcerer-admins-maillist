<PRE>Hi there.

Strangely enough, -O2 is better tested than even -O1 or -O0. It's also
what most binary software is compiled with. So, -O1 might be less
stable than -O2... it's certainly less tested.

-O3 the speedups over -O2 is questionable. Have you actually timed
bash running with -O2 and bash doing the same job with -O3? And with
-O1?

-O3 on ffmpeg and MesaLib is OK, as the software authors actually
specify it, and video work has a lot of loops in that benefit from
unrolling, etc.

Between -O2 and -O1, though, there is a marked difference. You could
try it for yourself and see. -O1 is both less tested and horribly
slower than -O2, there is no reason to use that. I have used -O1 and
-O0 before as a system default, and can tell you from experience that
you won't like it.

I do believe our distrobution default should be: mtune=native -O2 -pipe

I run march=native -O2 -pipe for everything that does not have CFLAGS
specified, but this is non-portable.

And yes, there are spells that require special flags. That's why we
have the CFLAG variable in spells. So, just ripping out all the -O3 in
the grimoire is also no advisable.

My original point still stands: We should not be using -O3 unless the
software author specifies it as both making a difference and is
tested.

As a way forward, may I suggest we leave the grimoire as is? There are
not that many spells specifying -O3, so it's still easy to monitor.

Anyone running into any instability might want to go see the flags the
spell is compiled with, and if it's -O3, try with -O2 and see if the
instability goes away. If it does, report that back to the Sorcerer
lists, and we'll take it out of the grimoire on a case by case basis.

Kind regards,
-Evert Vorster-

P.S. I just want to thank you for all the hard work you put into
Sorcerer, Kyle.

</I>&gt;<i> -O0 is produced no optimization with minimal compile time.
</I>&gt;<i> How much of KDE benefits from -O2 or firefox?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Possibly, we may want to reconsider Sorcerer default optimization?
</I>&gt;<i> Why not use -O0 -march=native for default optimization
</I>&gt;<i> and use -O2 on source that is expected to be capable of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From the gcc manual page:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; -O3 Optimize yet more. &#160;-O3 turns on all optimizations specified by -O2
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; and also turns on the -finline-functions, -funswitch-loops,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; -fpredictive-commoning, -fgcse-after-reload, -ftree-vectorize and
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; -fipa-cp-clone options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If someone has a source for which -O3 is unusable
</I>&gt;<i> then a good exercise might be to compile it with -O2
</I>&gt;<i> and enable each of the above optimizations and try
</I>&gt;<i> the outcome to see which optimization makes the code
</I>&gt;<i> segfault or the program not run properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason we use -O2 on everything is basically the same
</I>&gt;<i> reason that noob SAs would want to try -O3 on everything.
</I>&gt;<i> But I have long known -O2 is overkill because most processes
</I>&gt;<i> do not hog the CPU.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So how about -O2 for CPU intensive software
</I>&gt;<i> such as glibc, gcc, xz, bash, coreutils, MesaLib, etc...
</I>&gt;<i> and -O0 for everything else that runs gently
</I>&gt;<i> or spends most of it's time sleeping?
</I>&gt;<i> And sorcery can prohibit the SA from setting -O3,
</I>&gt;<i> because those additional optimizations can specified
</I>&gt;<i> individually if desired.
