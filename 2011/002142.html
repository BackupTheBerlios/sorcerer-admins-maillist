<PRE>Compared to Linux From Scratch, Sorcerer is easy to install! Also,
once installed, a Sorcerer box tends to stay that way. I have done a
Sorcerer install recently for the first time in many years, as I
wanted multilib functionality. I normally just clone my old install on
to a new computer and away I go on the newer hardware.

Every single Sorcerer task is done through the terminal, why should
the install be any different? Why do you need a GUI to install your
OS? I fail to see how having a mouse cursor makes it any easier to
install an operating system. Truly, a GUI install just limits you in
your choices. A detailed installation guide, somewhat like the ones
available for Linux From Scratch, would be a much bigger help for much
less effort.

Downloading 1 gigabyte in my home town takes more than a day. So,
smaller is definitely better when it comes to I/R disks. If you do
feel the need to have a I/R with a GUI, please don't discontinue the
current style of I/R.

Lastly, some Sorcerer boxes never get a GUI, as they are servers that
run headless, so for them to have X is just a pure waste.



There are very many distrobutions that exist for the pure purpose of
being easy to set up and use.

Sorcerer exists for people who don't like to be told how to run their
computers, and don't mind getting their hands dirty by tinkering under
the bonnet, and know how to put the pieces back together when it blows
up afterwards.

I found Sorcerer to be a great tool in teaching me how my computer
works and how software works in the free world by the very many
different ways I have managed to break my installations of Sorcerer.

Other people like Sorcerer for it's extreme ability of customization,
and ability to stay up to date. All of this, unfortunately requires
that you already have some knowledge of how a computer actually works.


Kind regards,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I still can't get it to work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What exactly is the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Often more is learned from working through a problem
</I>&gt;<i> than doing a fresh installation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there another computer in the house
</I>&gt;<i> that is connected to the Internet?
</I>&gt;<i> If so then the previous email with attached tarball containing the firmware
</I>&gt;<i> can be downloaded onto that computer.
</I>&gt;<i> From that computer the tarball can be transferred
</I>&gt;<i> to floppy disk, CDROM, or USB memory stick.
</I>&gt;<i> The removable media can be inserted into the Sorcerer box.
</I>&gt;<i> The device can be mounted.
</I>&gt;<i> And the contents of the tarball can be extracted to /
</I>&gt;<i> so that the firmware will land in /lib/firmware/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I'm going to have to wait for you to make another I/R CD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That might require a week or perhaps longer.
</I>&gt;<i> I am currently trying/testing some improvements to how SysVInit works
</I>&gt;<i> on Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hopefully it won't be to long for you to create one that is wifi compatible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current I/R is wifi compatible.
</I>&gt;<i> In the past I included firmware on the I/R after SAs requested it.
</I>&gt;<i> There was two reasons for that.
</I>&gt;<i> First, I had to find the firmware and write spells for it.
</I>&gt;<i> Second, Sorcerer has a lean fast to download I/R
</I>&gt;<i> because SAs have requested it to be that way.
</I>&gt;<i> And third, until very recently I did not know that anyone
</I>&gt;<i> was creating a tarball full of free and non-free firmware.
</I>&gt;<i> Since no one objects to adding the firmware tarball to the I/R;
</I>&gt;<i> the next I/R will be better.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it will also be maybe 15% larger.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have a few suggestions first make it easy for users to connect to wifi.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the suggestion.
</I>&gt;<i> Please provide a sample implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Second make sure to make it easy to access the CDROM drive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Accessing the CDROM is easy.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually there are entries such as:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # Removable file systems
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/cdrom &#160; &#160; &#160;/media/cdrom &#160; &#160;iso9660 ro,users,noauto 0 0
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/dvd &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;/media/dvd &#160; &#160; &#160;udf &#160; &#160; ro,users,noauto 0 0
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/fd0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;/media/floppy &#160; auto &#160; &#160;rw,users,noauto 0 0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In /etc/fstab
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Usually udev creates a symbolic link from the CDROM/DVD device to /dev/cdrom
</I>&gt;<i> If not then the SA can edit /etc/fstab
</I>&gt;<i> and then fix the entry.
</I>&gt;<i> That way
</I>&gt;<i> # mount /media/cdrom
</I>&gt;<i> will mount the cdrom device
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> # umount /media/cdrom
</I>&gt;<i> will umount the cdrom device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Third make sure to include the GUI with the I/R cd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some I/Rs in the past had xorg included on the I/R.
</I>&gt;<i> However, Sorcerer SAs voiced their opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> They wanted xorg removed.
</I>&gt;<i> So now the only parts of xorg that come pre-installed
</I>&gt;<i> are libraries that are required by other pre-installed software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And finally if possible you should look into making a sorcerer live cd
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, I wanted to do that.
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to create a workstation ready I/R
</I>&gt;<i> that comes completely with KDE version 4.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, heated debate exists about this.
</I>&gt;<i> I chose to back down.
</I>&gt;<i> Make a request for a GUI enabled KDE-v4 pre-installed I/R
</I>&gt;<i> on the email list and read the reaction from Sorcerer SAs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so it would be easier for users to set up sorcerer on their computer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would it be easier or faster to install from a live CD?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A larger CD increases the time required to download,
</I>&gt;<i> increases the time required to burn the CD
</I>&gt;<i> and increases the potential for corruption when burning the CD.
</I>&gt;<i> Live CDs work best when installing on a virtual machine where the
</I>&gt;<i> actual ISO9660 image is used instead of being burned to a physical optical disk.
</I>&gt;<i> That way there is no chance for error when reading the ISO9660.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I hope my suggestions help. Nathan.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i> I appreciate suggestions.
</I>&gt;<i> As I mentioned above,
</I>&gt;<i> I gave much consideration to a Sorcerer live CD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current design for the I/R is not favorable for a live CD.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is not impossible to achieve.
</I>&gt;<i> Significant modification of the I/R is not required.
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the installed software on the I/R
</I>&gt;<i> is provided in xz compressed tarballs
</I>&gt;<i> residing in /var/cache/archive/
</I>&gt;<i> This achieves near optimal compression
</I>&gt;<i> and thus allows tiny quick to download I/Rs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additional archives for xorg and kde can also be provided in /var/cache/archive/
</I>&gt;<i> However, that change alone would not make it a live CD.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if a box enough gigabytes of RAM installed
</I>&gt;<i> then the content of the xorg and kde archives
</I>&gt;<i> can be extracted prior to installation.
</I>&gt;<i> Once the files are extracted from archive
</I>&gt;<i> then kdm can be run and a GUI login can be presented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Minimal RAM for Sorcerer installation is currently somewhat less than 512M.
</I>&gt;<i> I know this because I use 512M RAM load out on virtual computers to
</I>&gt;<i> test new I/Rs.
</I>&gt;<i> A KDE or GNOME live CD style I/R requires a few gigabytes of RAM.
</I>&gt;<i> The other drawback is that 620M of archives must
</I>&gt;<i> be read from the CDROM device and then decompressed.
</I>&gt;<i> Even booting with a fast CDROM drive
</I>&gt;<i> would require the SA to wait more than 5 minutes
</I>&gt;<i> while archives are read and decompressed.
</I>&gt;<i> Even a SMP CPU can not achieve the task faster,
</I>&gt;<i> because the source of the bottleneck is the CDROM drive
</I>&gt;<i> or the USB memory stick that is providing the ISO9660 image.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although I know how to create a Sorcerer live CD
</I>&gt;<i> most Sorcerer SAs have their own personal reasons for not wanting a
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer live CD.
</I>&gt;<i> In summary the banes are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Booting the I/R requires more RAM.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Booting the I/R is slower.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Download the I/R requires longer.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Burning the I/R requires longer.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Probability of the I/R corrupting while burning increases due to
</I>&gt;<i> the increased size of the I/R.
</I>&gt;<i> 6. Installation time increases by at least 4x.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And the boons are:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. A GUI login might appear if xorg can correctly auto configure the hardware.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My idea for a Sorcerer live CD would be all of the above and also
</I>&gt;<i> a video player and automatic dhcpcd network configuration.
</I>&gt;<i> I want root's X11 desktop
</I>&gt;<i> to contain some links to videos hosted on youtube
</I>&gt;<i> that further instruct the SA in how to do the installation.
</I>&gt;<i> That way Sorcerer noobs can run the menu driven installer
</I>&gt;<i> in one terminal emulation program
</I>&gt;<i> while the instruction video streams
</I>&gt;<i> in the konqueror or firefox web browser.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like the idea.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I have been unable to gain consensus among Sorcerer SAs.
</I>&gt;<i> They want and I/R that is fast to download and good for the tasks of
</I>&gt;<i> installation and rescue.
</I>&gt;<i> They do not want a pre-compiled binary based distro live CD style I/R.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus far Nathan and I are the only Sorcerer SAs
</I>&gt;<i> that expect that a live CD could be useful and entertaining.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I create I/Rs for the Sorcerer SAs.
</I>&gt;<i> So if they do not want it and will not use it
</I>&gt;<i> then it is of no use for me to create it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, here is a bit of how it it adds up in terms of size...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # cd /var/cache/archive/x86_64/
</I>&gt;<i> # du -cm $( echo kde-v4 | augur req arof | while read; do echo -n
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;$REPLY/&quot;; augur log version &quot;$REPLY&quot; | cat; done ) | tail
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; djvulibre/3.5.24
</I>&gt;<i> 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; kdemultimedia-v4/4.6.2
</I>&gt;<i> 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; lame/3.98.3
</I>&gt;<i> 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; libmusicbrainz/2.1.5
</I>&gt;<i> 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; taglib/1.7
</I>&gt;<i> 3 &#160; &#160; &#160; kdeplasma-addons-v4/4.6.2
</I>&gt;<i> 4 &#160; &#160; &#160; kdeutils-v4/4.6.2
</I>&gt;<i> 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; libarchive/2.8.4
</I>&gt;<i> 666 &#160; &#160; total
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # du -cm $( echo gnome | augur req arof | while read; do echo -n
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;$REPLY/&quot;; augur log version &quot;$REPLY&quot; | cat; done ) | tail
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; gzip/1.4
</I>&gt;<i> 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; gedit/3.0.0
</I>&gt;<i> 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; gnome-python-desktop/2.32.0
</I>&gt;<i> 19 &#160; &#160; &#160;gnome-games/3.0.0
</I>&gt;<i> 4 &#160; &#160; &#160; gnome-games-extra-data/3.0.0
</I>&gt;<i> 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; gnome-nettool/3.0.0
</I>&gt;<i> 2 &#160; &#160; &#160; vinagre/3.0.0
</I>&gt;<i> 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; gtk-vnc/0.4.3
</I>&gt;<i> 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; polkit-gnome/0.101
</I>&gt;<i> 532 &#160; &#160; total
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, using the current and complete kde-v4 might not be possible,
</I>&gt;<i> because the sum of all the required xz compressed archives exceeds 600M
</I>&gt;<i> So times have changed and creating a 700M live CD is more challenging.
</I>&gt;<i> Selecting the most appropriate loadout of software,
</I>&gt;<i> which might be gnome instead of KDE,
</I>&gt;<i> could require a month or more to complete, test, and make available.
</I>&gt;<i> If we can gain consensus then we can do it.
</I>&gt;<i> If not then creating it becomes a terrible waste of time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The important question is not, &quot;Can it be done?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> The important question is, &quot;Should it be done?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> For this type of change that question is primarily answered by asking,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Who will use it?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My guess is that most SAs regard Sorcerer installation
</I>&gt;<i> as approximately 20 minutes of menu driven of tedium.
</I>&gt;<i> That is my impression each time I test an I/R.
</I>&gt;<i> The basic steps of partition the disk, creating file systems,
</I>&gt;<i> copying the contents of the I/R to the fixed disk
</I>&gt;<i> requires about 20 minutes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SAs seldom become excited about a short single run event.
</I>&gt;<i> They probably want to accomplish the initial installation
</I>&gt;<i> as soon as possible with a minimal possibility of problems.
</I>&gt;<i> And that is probably why the tiny I/R is favored by Sorcerer SAs
</I>&gt;<i> instead of a big fluffy live CD style I/R.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please do not accept merely my word about it.
</I>&gt;<i> This debate repeats nearly every other year.
</I>&gt;<i> So I will also send this reply to the Sorcerer email list.
</I>&gt;<i> That way Sorcerer SAs can contribute their point of view.
</I>&gt;<i> SAs, please make sure that replies also goto Nathan Jeffery Allen
</I>&gt;<i> since he might be subscribed to the monthly digest
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the daily delivery of the Sorcerer email list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When making decisions about Sorcerer evolution two separate
</I>&gt;<i> questions are asked, &quot;Can do?&quot; &quot;Should do?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Most suggestions pass the &quot;Can it be done?&quot; question.
</I>&gt;<i> However, few suggestions achieve either a favorable boon to bane evaluation,
</I>&gt;<i> or they fail to achieve consensus among Sorcerer SAs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Sorcerer live CD is exactly that type of debate
</I>&gt;<i> that always remains an issue simmering on a burner in the background,
</I>&gt;<i> yet never quite gathers sufficient heat and resources to boil.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So this time around I am offering a slight variation of the standard argument.
</I>&gt;<i> It is based upon ideas contributed by Bob Finch years ago.
</I>&gt;<i> Bob wanted a directory of ready to install archives available via HTTP.
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously at that time making a large selection of archives available
</I>&gt;<i> for download was impossible.
</I>&gt;<i> The main reason was that Sorcerer's hosting providers were kicking
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer around.
</I>&gt;<i> Until the current hosting provider, silverice.org,
</I>&gt;<i> nobody granted Sorcerer sufficient resources
</I>&gt;<i> in order to construct a master source cache.
</I>&gt;<i> So times have changed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I am still against providing a supreme pizza repository of archives.
</I>&gt;<i> Hybridization of Sorcerer is a bad idea.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I have not stopped considering the possibility of
</I>&gt;<i> a boon for keeping part of the I/R available via HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> instead of being downloaded and burned to a CDROM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few years ago I created a sub-project to play with this idea.
</I>&gt;<i> I created a fuse module for mounting an ISO9660 image
</I>&gt;<i> that is hosted remotely via HTTP.
</I>&gt;<i> It translated block requests into byte range requests that were handed
</I>&gt;<i> to curl's library.
</I>&gt;<i> My attempt at creating a fuse + curl based
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP mounted iso9660 was a success.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, it was horribly slow over the Internet.
</I>&gt;<i> If most people can download about 512K/second from the Internet
</I>&gt;<i> then transferring a 600M file requires about 20 minutes.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe that was why it seemed terribly slow?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If an I/R was created that has the possibility of doing
</I>&gt;<i> a fancy GUI boot like a live CD, and yet did not include
</I>&gt;<i> archives for those required files on the CDROM
</I>&gt;<i> then those archives could be downloaded from the Internet.
</I>&gt;<i> On a 512K/second Internet connection approximately
</I>&gt;<i> 20 minutes are required in order to do a live CD style boot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again this creates a situation where the time required
</I>&gt;<i> for selecting the optional GUI boot of the I/R
</I>&gt;<i> exceeds the time expected to be required for doing
</I>&gt;<i> an installation from a virtual console.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To avoid the problem of creating a larger I/R
</I>&gt;<i> and yet still providing a live CD style I/R
</I>&gt;<i> costs about 10 to 20 minutes in order to download
</I>&gt;<i> and decompress the required files.
</I>&gt;<i> The advantage is that the 700M barrier no longer applies,
</I>&gt;<i> since an unlimited amount of files can be downloaded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No matter how we look at the situation
</I>&gt;<i> we can not achieve something for nothing.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone willing to wait 20 minutes for the I/R to boot please say so.
</I>&gt;<i> Because for the moment this solution is the only solution
</I>&gt;<i> that provides the option doing a live CD style boot
</I>&gt;<i> while maintaining a tiny I/R size for SAs that
</I>&gt;<i> want to skip the fluff and go straight to a virtual console
</I>&gt;<i> in order to run the menu driven installer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the long email, but I like to cover all the facts.
</I>&gt;<i> What at first seems like a clever useful idea
</I>&gt;<i> can often come with some significantly heavy costs.
</I>&gt;<i> A live CD requires about 600M of files
</I>&gt;<i> and there is no way that 600M of files decompresses,
</I>&gt;<i> downloads, or reads from CDROM instantly.
</I>&gt;<i> A live CD has a very heavy cost in additional boot time and RAM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, I want to point out that Sorcerer is not a pre-compiled binary
</I>&gt;<i> based distro.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, archives include header files and ar library archives.
</I>&gt;<i> Also additional spells for software such as &quot;make&quot; and &quot;gcc&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> must be available on the I/R.
</I>&gt;<i> As compared to a pre-compiled binary based distro
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer already has a 15% overhead in additional files
</I>&gt;<i> that are required for a base installation.
</I>&gt;<i> That factor alone makes Sorcerer less suitable for a live CD distro
</I>&gt;<i> as compared to a pre-compiled binary based distro.
</I>&gt;<i> When compared byte for byte
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer will probably be unable to provide as much user desired
</I>&gt;<i> software on a live CD as compared to a pre-compiled binary based
</I>&gt;<i> distro's live CD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is not to imply that Sorcerer is deficient.
</I>&gt;<i> Rather pre-compiled binary based distros have greater
</I>&gt;<i> potential for live CDs than Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> However, Sorcerer still excels at tasks for which Sorcerer is designed.
</I>&gt;<i> Although a Sorcerer live CD would be amusing
</I>&gt;<i> the absence of Sorcerer live CD is not by chance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In summary, the most essential question of this email is
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Who is willing to wait an additional 20 minutes for the I/R to boot
</I>&gt;<i> after requesting the live CD option from the boot menu?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> If nobody is willing to wait
</I>&gt;<i> then there is no point to allocating effort to that sub-project.
