<PRE>Yet again I changed it.

Top level cgroups are: real; fast; norm; slow; idle.
That is in descending order of performance.
Second level cgroups look like:

{fast,norm,slow,idle}/user
{real,fast,norm,slow,idle}/daemon
slow/sorcery/{cast,dispel,leech}

The reason for this change is so that when I run
cgroup-idle $( pgrep qemu )
the PID from that process goes into
idle/user/kyle/tasks
rather than
user/kyle/idle/tasks

This is because in the overall workings of cgroup
cpu.shares are competed for at the top level cgroups.
And then the shares are distributed among
the tasks and sub cgroups of each top level cgroup.
The concept is difficult to grasp without reading the cgroup documentation.
However, this is how it should be to have processes run at the speed
that we desire.

real = realtime
fast = about 1.5 faster than cgroup norm shares.
norm = the baseline
slow = significantly slower than norm
idle = minimal resource consumption.

control groups do not effect how fast a process runs.
They effect the ratio of CPU attention distributed
among processes over a period of time.
Therefore, a process running full bore
that is not competing with other processes
still receives as much CPU as can be provided
without regard to the control group.
However, if one process is competing in fast
against a process competing in norm.
Then the process in fast is awarded more of the CPU.

Think of it as something like nice values, but better.
users can now migrate their processes using
cgroup-idle, cgroup-slow, cgroup-fast.
User processes start in cgroup norm/user/$USER/
Therefore, there is no cgroup-norm
Users receive can promote their processes to cgroup
fast/user/$USER/ to be nasty hog of resources.
However realtime in cgroup real is prohibited for users.
Someone who is root or a system service can use realtime.

The blkio subsystem of cgrou pis not yet hierarchical yet.
However it probably will be in the future.
Therefore, for the moment read/write access is rather uniform
since newly created control groups receive 500 for blkio.weight.
Parent control group values are not inherited.
However, sorcery's leech and dispel receive only 100 blkio.weight.
Everything else seems to be about 500.
Sorry, I do not yet have a quick fix for that.
