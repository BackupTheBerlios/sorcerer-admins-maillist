<PRE>Hi there...

Ah, I flattened a multilib box into a pure 64 bit install by accident.
So, in wanting to go back to Multilib I wanted to just mount my root
partition somewhere, wipe it, and restore from an earlier backup that
was known good.

I stopped most processes, and then Alt-F7 into my &quot;keep&quot;

Unfortunately, /media was read-only, I did not have enough time to
mess with it, and I was not brave enough to rm -r * in the mounted
directory.

So, I whipped out the Sorcerer I/R and once booted, just mkfs.ext4 on
the affected partition, mount, restore, lilo, reboot and I was back up
and running in about 20 minutes.

This would be a killer cool feature if an SA can restore ROOT without
rebooting.

:<i>D
</I>
I was so close, too. :(

&gt;<i> I recently gave a nickname to the Sorcerer's initramfs.
</I>&gt;<i> I call it the keep of the Sorcerer's castle.
</I>&gt;<i> The name is appropriate in many ways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, thus far the potential of the keep is mostly untapped.
</I>&gt;<i> After booting completes only /sbin/init and /sbin/agetty continue
</I>&gt;<i> running from the keep.
</I>&gt;<i> I was discussing with Evert that perhaps udev should remain running on the keep
</I>&gt;<i> and that also the system logger program should run from the keep.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Processes running in the keep have both benefits and drawbacks.
</I>&gt;<i> First, the process is not likely to be reading or writing to files that exist
</I>&gt;<i> on a filesystem attached to a physical device.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, processes running from the keep
</I>&gt;<i> are unlikely to become zombies or freeze
</I>&gt;<i> in the event of a serious disk or serious file system error.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if the system logger runs from the keep
</I>&gt;<i> then it would write files to a tmpfs that would also be bound
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere in /var/log/ so that it can be viewed from both places.
</I>&gt;<i> No inconvenience with that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first and most obvious drawback is that the system logs eat swap.
</I>&gt;<i> A box that keeps a years worth of system logs,
</I>&gt;<i> without rebooting, might eat a lot of swap.
</I>&gt;<i> Apparently, that is not a problem with metalog.
</I>&gt;<i> Also if a box reboots or shutdown unexpectedly rather
</I>&gt;<i> than using the proper method
</I>&gt;<i> then the content of the logs would be lost.
</I>&gt;<i> The most obvious method to avoid that is
</I>&gt;<i> to have the system logger also output over the network
</I>&gt;<i> to a logger listening on a different box.
</I>&gt;<i> And at least 9 out of 10 times when a box loses power suddenly
</I>&gt;<i> there is no clue in the on disk system log as to what happened.
</I>&gt;<i> Lost system logs could be annoying for other reasons,
</I>&gt;<i> but on a box operating perfectly normal
</I>&gt;<i> then a system log would not be lost.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Switching udev to running from keep I have mostly decided upon.
</I>&gt;<i> Whether or not to switch system loggers is yet undecided.
</I>&gt;<i> I pose the question on the list in order to gather insight from Sorcerer SAs.
</I>&gt;<i> Some SAs might know reasons for why that change would be very undesirable.
</I>&gt;<i> In contrast, I prefer a system log that runs
</I>&gt;<i> no-matter-what-except-sudden-power-loss. &#160;:)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since Sorcerer boxes use the keep both during boot and shutdown
</I>&gt;<i> we should also consider what process we want
</I>&gt;<i> to start and continue running on the keep.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, the keep is currently inaccessible when we ssh into a box.
</I>&gt;<i> But what if sshing into the box is not working?
</I>&gt;<i> Might we want to be able to ssh into the keep?
</I>&gt;<i> So should sshd also be running on the keep
</I>&gt;<i> but accessible on a different port?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe TCP port 30 since it lacks an assignment in /etc/services ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No matter what new bugs may lay siege
</I>&gt;<i> to a box when installed software is updated;
</I>&gt;<i> the keep remains as potential last point of retreat.
</I>&gt;<i> It is a zone of safety from which problems
</I>&gt;<i> can be carefully examined and solved
</I>&gt;<i> without being mired in the battlefield on /media/root/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So how should we fortify the keep?
</I>&gt;<i> Besides ssh and scp
</I>&gt;<i> what other useful programs and libraries
</I>&gt;<i> should be moved into the keep?
</I>&gt;<i> What processes should be started in the keep and remain running?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since the initramfs is being retained as the central &quot;keep&quot; of our
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer's castle
</I>&gt;<i> we should grown accustomed to the idea that it is a valid file system
</I>&gt;<i> for running
</I>&gt;<i> processes, daemons, and services.
</I>&gt;<i> What benefits most from running inside the keep?
</I>&gt;<i> What deserves the honor?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for making a moment to consider it.
</I>&gt;<i> No urgent requirement to rack one's brain.
</I>&gt;<i> For over a decade the initrd and initramfs was considered
</I>&gt;<i> a filesystem to be discarded after booting.
</I>&gt;<i> That habit of thought is not easily discarded.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet if something useful pops into mind
</I>&gt;<i> then please share it.
