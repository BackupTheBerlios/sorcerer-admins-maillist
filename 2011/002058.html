</I>
The initramfs on the Install/Rescue disk has an /etc/fstab
that does not specify what device holds a root file system.
The initramfs on the I/R has lilo.conf that lacks information
about where to install lilo.
The I/R initramfs is default runlevel 3.
The I/R initramfs has installed init-scripts that are specific
to the task of preparing the initramfs for use for the purpose
of installation such as unpacking archives and finding the CDROM.
It is much like a new suit before being tailored to fit.

</I>
The Sorcerer initramfs is a useful tool for fixing a box.
It was intended to be so.
It is not merely a gas station on the road to booting.
It is more like a 5 star hotel with restaurant, gym, swimming pool,
and golf course.


&gt;<i>&#160;For recovery, it seems like most of the system is
</I>&gt;<i> there;
</I>
When booting the Install/Rescue disk the initramfs is made extra nice.
It becomes much more full of useful programs and files
than what is normally used for booting a deployed box.
This also makes slower to present a login getty.


&gt;<i> and the speed of install has greatly increased with the 7z
</I>&gt;<i> sources.
</I>
Not so much the 5 sources,
but all the tarballs in the archive cache are xz compressed.
And I set up a single step where cat xz and tar are invoked
only once or twice each in order to unarchive all the software.
Therefore, that should create a very smooth and rapid installation.
First, archives are copied to fixed disk which provides faster access
and caching if sufficient RAM is available.
Next archives are unarchived onto the new root file system.
I gave considerable thought as to how to make the Install/Rescue disks
small and also fast to install.


&gt;<i>&#160;Also fewer things seem to really require building.
</I>
In most cases if something might be required then
having it pre-installed on the I/R is a bit easier than
compiling the source.
That is why the I/R has only about 5 source tarballs on it.


&gt;<i> Is VLC a default thing installed now?
</I>
No.

&gt;<i>&#160;that means a good deal more than X is
</I>&gt;<i> available if the gtk interface also works.
</I>&gt;<i>&#160;Maybe some things can be obsoleted like CVS.
</I>
cvs and subversion are not provided on the I/R
And gtk+ is installed on almost every box,
but is not provided pre-installed on the I/R.


&gt;<i> I recently updated libpng to 1.4 version; but I can see this causing
</I>&gt;<i> portability problems, so I'm expecting spells to break now.
</I>
Yes, I am still holding off on updating libpng and zlib.
The libpng spell has the warning that
version 1.4.0 is not a drop-in replacement for the 1.2.x libpng.

&gt;<i> Although I appreciate the ability to cast a low level spell like
</I>&gt;<i> libpng and not have a lot of impact; technically shouldn't all spells
</I>&gt;<i> depending on the library also get queued to cast?
</I>
No.  That is the beauty of a distro that
relies almost entirely upon ELF shared libraries.
The ELF libraries have a numbering system where the
most immediate number after the library name changes
when the newer library's API is considered binary incompatible
with previous releases of the library.
Another way is to say that the so-name of a library changes
when the newer library is binary incompatible with the older library.
Installation of a newer binary incompatible library triggers the &quot;Miss
ELF&quot; event.
And spells that have the &quot;Miss ELF&quot; event are recompiled and reinstalled.

Only a small percentage of library updates cause &quot;Miss ELF&quot; events.
That is why updating libraries does not always cause software
that requires those libraries to also recast.

A distro that uses mostly AR or static link libraries must
recompile of all the installed software that requires updated libraries.
That is because the code from the library contained in the ar archive
is linked directly into the executable files that require the library.
In contrast linking with dynamic or shared object libraries means that
the code from the library is not linked directly into executable files.
Instead the code is read from the library file on disk at run time
and then it is linked in memory.

The use of dynamic libraries or shared object libraries allows for
RAM to be conserved and for updates to the library to immediately
effect all the software that loads those shared libraries
on the next time such software starts.
Software already running is not effected by the change
of an ELF library on disk.

Doing static linking with libraries also makes executable files larger.
So a distro that uses mostly shared libraries tends to use less disk space.
However, using shared libraries makes programs start about 3 times slower
as compared to a program that is entirely statically linked.

Some software projects provide only static link libraries.
Often that is the situation when the size of the library is very small.
However, the majority of free software provides both shared and static
libraries.
With Sorcerer most spells instruct software projects to not compile
and not install the static libraries.
Since static libraries are usually not used
they merely waste space on disk.

Another advantage of shared libraries is that calls made to shared libraries
can be intercepted, logged, traced, modified, etc...
A good example of that was the sorcery-sentinel preloadable library.
It intercepted calls made to some functions provided in the glibc library
and then it logged the information.
That made possible some nice installation logs in the days when
software was installed directly to / instead of using a $DESTDIR.

As I wrote before Sorcerer uses mostly shared libraries.
It is not merely a norm for linux boxes, but also my preference.
Sorcerer/sorcery was designed for shared libraries.
It was designed not to trace what was statically linked
and then recompile it as necessary.
Instead it is designed to quickly detect &quot;Miss ELF&quot; events
and to recompile software that is linked with dynamic libraries
that are no longer installed.
