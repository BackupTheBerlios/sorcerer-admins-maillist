<PRE>When using the dual architecture installer for NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64
then it installs most of it into the DESTDIR
except many of the ELF 32-bit libraries such as libGL
which it installs directly into /usr/lib/
overwriting the libGL installed by MesaLib
and also creating alien files.

However, the solution of having two spells:
NVIDIA-Linux-x86{,_64}
solves the problem.

I rather not admit how many hours of testing, trial and fixing
was required in order to solve the problem involving NVIDIA-Linux.
However, I will say that I advise against using a custom spell for those.
The new spells are tested, tracks fine, and does not overwrite
files installed by MesaLib.
However, I am a bit disappointed that
I could not accomplish the task using a single spell.
The installer does something unexpected and files that
one installer puts into DESTDIR are soon removed by
the other installer.
But having two spells is not terrible.
Generally, for every rule there is an exception.
And this is the exception for multilib Sorcerer.
It is the only spell combination where one spell installs the ELF 32-bit
and the other spell installs the ELF 64-bit.
But we are talking about something that comes mostly pre-compiled anyway,
and for that fact it is already strange from the beginning.

When I first designed Sorcerer multilib
I carefully considered the possibility
of having separate installed spells
for ELF 32-bit libraries and ELF 64-bit libraries.
But in some ways that might make
the loadout of installed software
more complicated for SAs.
I never did fancy using separate packages for
headers, shared libraries, static libraries, servers, clients, and utilities
which is the method by which pre-compiled binary based distributions
chop sources into several tiny packages.
Instead of installing net-utils there might be a separate package for each
installed executable like a separate package for ping,
separate package for traceroute,
and separate package for inetd.
Who wants a box with 2000+ installed packages?
Oh, sorry I went on a tangent for a moment.

And for many software projects cast gains an advantage by either being able
to use a single source tree to compile both ELF 32-bit and ELF 64-bit
libraries concurrently,
or by being able to use a hard linked source tree.
Spells like qt-everywhere-opensource as a single spell
can have both ELF 32-bit and ELF 64-bit version compiled concurrently
which is more efficient than linear compilation
of 2 separate solo spells for qt-everywhere-opensource.

But sometimes I also consider that having separate spells might
make easier knowing if an installed library spell actually installed
ELF 32-bit libraries.
And it might allow more precise control over which sets of ELF 32-bit
libraries are installed.
In that fashion all libraries required by wine could have their ELF
32-bit versions installed
while libraries outside of the requirement chain need not have their
ELF 32-bit libraries
installed.

Basically, there are advantages and disadvantages to both methods.
But we have something that works and is not without a certain
eloquence and simplicity.
Therefore, we should probably use it just like the revised
NVIDIA-Linux-x86* spells.

I enjoy having multilib.
But wow it required an absurd amount of effort to create.

Okay, one last aspect I forgot to mention is the monolib functionality.
On my workstation I used augur monolib in order to alter
qt-everywhere-opensource so that it installed without ELF 32-bit libraries.
Naturally, every library spell that requires qt-everywhere-opensource
also installs without ELF 32-bit libraries.
The effects are a savings of disk space and reduction of compile time.
Of course if I want to run an ELF 32-bit executable
that links with KDE or qt-everywhere-opensource
then I must remove qt-everywhere-opensource from monolib
and then recast every installed library spell that requires
qt-everywhere-opensource.
Actually, that is not a complicated task.

# echo qt-everywhere-opensource | augur monolib off
# ( echo qt-everywhere-opensource | augur req iron; augur installed
library ) | sort | uniq -d | augur queue qt-everywhere-opensource;
augur begin

However, my point is that monolib can be used to explicitly disable
ELF 32-bit library creation for specific requirement chains.
It is a bit less problematic than trying to accomplish
the same outcome automatically and transparently.
But it could become a possibility if Sorcerer SAs wanted it.

Thus seems as if nobody has anything to say about Sorcerer multilib,
except Evert and myself as we tested, fixed, and honed it.
For the most part the changes should be transparent to SAs.
Using multilib Sorcerer x86_64 should be nearly identical
to the experience of using pure x86_64 Sorcerer.
We certainly did not fall short of meeting that goal.
