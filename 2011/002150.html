Sorry for rolling the new I/Rs practically over the heels
of the I/Rs that I rolled mid last month.
However, two SAs requested new I/Rs for separate reasons.
So I sacrificed a weekend of rest and relaxation
in order to bring these new I/Rs to life on the verge of this
new week and new month.


&gt;<i> Thanks for all the hard work, Kyle.
</I>
Thanks for the appreciation.
There is much to appreciate about these new I/Rs.
They have an additional revision of the Sorcerer init improvements.
And several init-scripts were modified in order to tidy output
that were not necessarily bugs but could attract a SA's attention.

I do not know for certain if the previous month's I/Rs
provided /etc/bind/named.conf and /etc/ssh/sshd_config
I made certain that these I/Rs install them.
That way sshd will start on the first non-IR boot
and DNS names will resolve.
The default sshd config does not allow root login.
So not having the root password set immediately is not a problem.
However, I still strongly recommend setting the root password
before configuring a network device.

&gt;<i> I updated Sorcerer on my laptop, and have not really tried out all the
</I>&gt;<i> bells and whistles yet.
</I>
Maybe that is good.
A day or two ago I detected that he UTC time was incorrect
by exactly 2 hours on sorcerer.silverice.org.
So I do not know if grimoire tarballs were complete.
I do suspect that they rolled either 2 hours earlier or 2 hours later
than expected.
However, the time problem is now fixed.
The LAG=0 grimoire that rolls in a couple of hours
will be synchronized with the grimoire provided on the new I/R

&gt;<i> Currently that install is going through a complete rebuild, as I had
</I>&gt;<i> some segfaults writing out to webm video format ( libvpx ) and also in
</I>&gt;<i> midnight commander using sftp ( threadlib )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, it's the first thing to try, then I'll bug-hunt some more if that
</I>&gt;<i> does not fix it.
</I>
Yanking bugs out by their wriggling tails is a good idea.
Errors involving segmentation faults
might be resolved by trying newer or older versions of the library.
Sometimes less aggressive compiler optimization flags fix the problem.
If a definite unsuitable for use version of software is discovered
then please report that for a distribution wide fix.
