<PRE>I made transparent changes to Sorcerer and sorcery
for more optimal utilization of resources.

The least significant change is that
boxes with less than 1G of RAM
will not have tmpfs mounted on /usr/src/sorcery/

However, spells with the &quot;huge&quot; attribute
now compile with their source trees on /usr/src/
rather than tmpfs on /usr/src/sorcery/
That way spells that used to be have the &quot;solo&quot; attribute
such as firefox and qt-everywhere-opensource
can now cast concurrently with other spells.

tmpfs on /usr/src/sorcery/ was always to provide
optimal compilation times for sources
where their trees, object files, and installation
all easily fit within the RAM cache.
Consequently, having huge sources compile
on a real file system may be preferred
to aggressive use of swap.

As a result spells such as firefox and qt-everywhere-opensource
which used to be unavoidable bottlenecks
became regular bottlenecks.
And by &quot;bottleneck&quot; I mean that the spell
could spend most of it's time casting solo
even if it did not have the &quot;solo&quot; attribute.

However, I rather not have potential resources
go to waste while compiling bottleneck spells.
As a result I improved ordering so that
spells with the bottleneck attribute receive preferential ordering
and thus occur sooner rather than later.

# cat /root/.sorcery/index.d/order |
sed &quot;0,/qt-everywhere-opensource/p;d&quot; | wc -l
2746

became
# cat /root/.sorcery/index.d/order |
sed &quot;0,/qt-everywhere-opensource/p;d&quot; | wc -l
208

Therefore, from boosting it's requirements and the spell
to a favorable positioning in the order list of spells
the huge source of qt-everywhere-opensource
gains an enhanced opportunity to cast concurrently with other spells.
That way sorcery has better probability of using all available cores.

This is possible because there are millions of correct
permutations for a properly ordered list of spells.
Achieving an optimally ordered list is more of an art than a science.
Consequently, please report spells that appear
to be good candidates for the &quot;bottleneck&quot; attribute.
And together we will smash through download bottlenecks
and compilation bottlenecks in the grand tradition of Sorcerer.
