Yeah, I dunno...

On the surface, it sounds good that Sorcerer might have a shiny new KDE
w/graphical UI install...

I dunno though...

I like the minimalistic approach, and admittedly, I like having an
*option* of stuffing a window manager/GUI in there real quick upon
installation too - but that might mean that we're heading down a road
where Sorcerer becomes mired in the mediocrity that results from being
just another binary distro like all the others...

Okay Kyle, I'm on the fence here.

I like the minimalistic approach, and then considering that everything
gets compiled and installed with whatever I'm wanting - that is good
(Including XFCE, Gnome, or KDE).

I personally don't see any value added or reason for VLC, however - that
smacks of *workstation* to me, and although Sorcerer is a fine
workstation (if that's how you build it), I would expect that to be left
up to me as an SA.

Yeah, I see no utility in VLC.

KDE, however, (gosh, I am SOOOOooo on the fence about this) might be
good - as you mention below, we could migrate toward a distro that has a
quick install w/say, KDE as an *option*, along with a Graphical UI
installer too - or, the SA could decide NOT to install that or use a
Graphical UI installer and go the traditional route (which *should not*
IMO, be removed as the primary method.

I would like to know that even doing the installation of a binary
package for KDE, for example, doesn't preclude us from doing things just
as before, or being removed later.

I also like the notion, like DragonFlyBSD does it, of having *two*  I/R
disks - one that is the minimalistic and like we're used to, and one
that includes the GUI [option], which can still be treated as the
standard minimalistic I/R.

More below...

Me too.

</I>
I would have to disagree a bit with you here Kyle. I think it's the
installer. It's really not intuitive, and takes a few runs to begin to
get the hang of it. Not only that, but the lack of documentation to show
what is going on during the install and what to do immediately
thereafter - Documentation, that I've been working on a bit here and
there when I am able.

I believe that is the main obstacle.

The time factor, well, perhaps that does play a role, but when
installing as a server in a production environment, I have no need for X
whatsoever, and typically don't use it - that's what SSH is for.

Take SAMBA, for example, SWAT is kinda kewl for some things, but I would
certainly not use it to configure my smb.conf - but then again, SWAT is
http via stunnel - it's not a gui in the sense we're talking about here.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From my point of view there is no good compromise between
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer and a pre-compiled binary based distro.
</I>

Nor does there need to be, IMO. Two versions of the I/R might serve well
for [what I call] the *point-n-clickers* out there, who want to try
something new and need a mouse to get there by guessing.

We would certainly need some UI tools once we embark down that road,
however ;)

if the I/R's install says, &quot;Now you need to make a choice between the
Graphical UI installer, and the installation of X, a Window Manager
(KDE, Gnome, XFCE), and Firefox upon completion of the installation
process, or the standard, faster, traditional installation method on the
CLI (You may also still choose to have the Window Manager installed from
the binary package to save time and recompile later)&quot;.....

That kind of thing?

&gt;<i> However, some of the deployment time can be reduced by
</I>&gt;<i> providing on the Install/Rescue CD
</I>&gt;<i> firefox, vlc, and a few other useful programs.
</I>&gt;<i> But if Sorcerer SAs seem against that idea
</I>&gt;<i> then I will not add those to the I/R.
</I>
I'm not at all against it, I just think it needs further discussion as
this is a *Big* to do da.

It potentially changes a major course of the philosophy of Sorcerer -
even though Sorcerer is way beyond a *proof of concept*.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Basicly make more options what to compile and install. Like install just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bare core for eg. server purposes and if you are workstation user i dont
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mind if theres option for GUI install, etc. But dont require all users to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> install all bloated software, because some of us dont need it and dont use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it. So there cant be just one size fits all sort of installation because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO i dont think its possible.
</I>

I'm w/Pekka on this. Preservation of the Sorcerer way w/perhaps some
quick to do da's for the impatient?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If Sorcerer comes as a full bush
</I>&gt;<i> then it can be pruned down to size easily.
</I>&gt;<i> But if it comes as a little seed
</I>&gt;<i> then it requires a bit of time to grow.
</I>

Okay now we've crossed one of those proverbial *lines* that I rant on
about - The RH/Slack line.

As you know, I've been a Slackware fan since about 93 (It being better
than Jolix or SLS or MCC, and marginally better than Yggdrasil at that
time).

I frisbee'd my way out of the Redhat camp at the end  of version 5.2 -
one of the main reasons was the introduction of sucky releases beginning
w/6.0 and 7.0 (Like mACROsFOT, you had to wait to at least a .1 release
before it was stable).

My take on the matter is that you can install a Redhat (or other RPM
based distro) box and spend 'x' amount of time disabling all the holes
and daemons you shouldn't be running or exposing your machine with, or
you can spend an inverse (somewhat less) amount of time *enabling* that
which you want from a basic Slackware install.

I'm [almost] *always* going to want the &quot;little seed&quot; and take the time
to grow it right.

I don't like pruning things - it leaves a mess and things laying around
in what should be empty space.

For example, I'm simply not going to install X on a machine I'm
purposing for NAS - it just ain't gonna happen - so why should I be
forced to remove that, or the httpd server, or the ftp server, etc.?

I know what I want, and there shouldn't be any other ports open on that
box but the ports servicing requests for that requirement.

So with that in mind... Why would I want to do an install twice? Once to
install the OS and the other actually being a sort of *uninstall*, where
I spend half the day 'dispelling'.

Man - just nmap an RH, Fedora, or CentOS box out of the gate, LOL!

&gt;<i> There is a difference between required for initial installation
</I>&gt;<i> and becoming permanently required.
</I>
And therein lies the solution to the issue I'm concerned with.

Having a *choice* between *expert* (cli) install and GUI install in this
way doesn't detract at all, IMO, from the philosophy, utility, and
superiority of Sorcerer Linux.



&gt;<i> That can be discussed with the gobject-introspection software authors.
</I>&gt;<i> It was not my intention to make the installation of xorg libraries mandatory.
</I>&gt;<i> It happened to turn out that way.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, I went ahead and decided that a selection of xorg graphics drivers
</I>&gt;<i> and some other xorg related software would make a good addition.
</I>&gt;<i> But that was not the first thing I tried.
</I>&gt;<i> A long time ago I wrote a patch for gobject-introspection
</I>&gt;<i> so that console only boxes could be deployed.
</I>&gt;<i> But I did not want to constantly fight gobject-introspection authors about it.
</I>
hm...


&gt;<i> If it seems useful for rescue it might just go onto the Install/Rescue CD.
</I>
um... one final note on my part....

It isn't the size, that matters so much wrt the I/R, although for some
cases, a small I/R is indeed a real bonus. But I have I/R disks that I
carry with me, so the Download time vs bandwidth argument isn't so great
an issue for me - However:

Debian has three basic install methods:

1.) fat

2.) netinst (minimal - most closely resembling a Sorcerer install)

3.) PXE (we could do this too, and we've already discussed USB)

wrt Debian, for example, I generally use my netinst disk, unless
bandwidth is an issue (I bill by the hour anyway, although it is
certainly not my intent to great more billable hours this way).

I get my install and *decide* what I need from there (Again, I'm
watering the seed and not pruning the tree).


&gt;<i> ...Sorcerer SAs are expected to be able to use a command line
</I>&gt;<i> and to use the sorcery, cast, dispel, and augur tools.
</I>&gt;<i> An installation that is too fluffy to being with misrepresents
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that getting the most out of a Sorcerer box
</I>&gt;<i> requires some ability with using a command line shell.
</I>
There ya go ;) although I'm certainly not against a gui tool like
*aptitude* or *pkgtool* :)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, unless anyone objects
</I>&gt;<i> then I will try to make the next set of Install/Rescue CDs more minimalistic
</I>&gt;<i> to include prying off xorg libraries.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like the compromise is going towards tiny rather than convenient.
