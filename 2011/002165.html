I never use run level 1.
I understand the concept.
Yet I do not like the idea of a Sorcerer box
entering runlevel 1,
because the distro is designed to update
without requiring a change in runlevel.

Yes, telinit 7 could be made to close all getty
and do an automatic root autologin on virtual console #1
That provides a certain eloquence.
Yet that method is also abrupt.

A SA might want to login using virtual console #7
before deciding to switch to runlevel 7.
And if the SA makes that decision
then the SA might not want the sudden change in view
and the loss of command history
for what was typed on virtual console #7.

Switching to runlevel 1 is fine.
It might not stop everything.
It is not like runlevel 0 and 6.
And runlevel 1 definitely does not stop the
getty that are running on the real root file system.
So it might not be as useful as running killall from runlevel 7.

However, please beware that the last time I checked,
which was about a decade ago,
that the killall command does something different on Solaris.
I vaguely remember a day when I vowed
never again to invoke &quot;killall&quot; on a Solaris.
And I rarely used &quot;killall&quot; in years except in an init-script.
The subtle variations in command parameter arguments
and order of parameters and the functions of commands
gives me a preference for GNU's utilities over Solaris.
It is almost like having two know separate dialects
of a single language such as being able to communicate
both in kantou ben and kansai ben of the Japanese language.
Sorry, I digressed.

Perhaps most of /etc/init.d/
is also available in
/etc.ori/init.d/

/etc/rc.d/ can be regenerated from /etc/init.d/
by running /lib/lsb/install_initd

If I wanted to restore /etc/init.d/
that I accidentally deleted
then I would first use what exists in /etc.ori/init.d/
And next I would probably allow cast to do the rest:

# grep -r /etc/init.d/ /etc/sorcery/log/install/ |
tr ':' '\t' | while read SPELL FILE; do
[ -f $FILE ] || echo $SPELL; done |
sed 's:.*/::' | augur begin

Takes a little bit of time to recast software,
so for an extra two lines I could have written
the statement to extract from archives.
Yet I normally consider archives to be the
last possible choice before restoring from backup.
If I accidentally dispelled &quot;make&quot;
then naturally I would restore it from archive
since a box can not make make without make.  :)

Normally,
# augur begin sorcery-md5sum

would do all that fixing that I want.
But it might currently be instructed
to ignore checking the md5sums and
existence of files in /etc/init.d/
