</I>
Ya I don't know speicfically what the problem is; I'm probably wrong
about the lilo thing... maybe the initramfs script failed at some
point and lilo didn't get the initrd right?  maybe it's cause i have a
hardware ether override on my network card which if kexec is used, the
hardware doesn't get reset so it comes up as like eth2 cause its
hwaddr doesn't match what udev thinks it is in
70-persistant-network-rules(whatever) ... so the network scripts
didn't initialize right?

Maybe the kernel driver changed and eth0 and 1 got reversed
(again)....  it'll be a week until I get back home and can even see :)
(no worries, I got everything I really needed)


&gt;<i> As for kernel and module removal...
</I>&gt;<i> This is not done by sorcery.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead it is done by /etc/init.d/lilo
</I>&gt;<i> The last 4 installed kernels are kept.
</I>&gt;<i> The most recently installed kernel becomes the default
</I>&gt;<i> kernel unless a default is specified in /etc/lilo/head
</I>&gt;<i> Specifying a default in /etc/lilo/head can become problematic
</I>&gt;<i> eventually when that kernel is removed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ya that's a good idea; but it should be the last 4 + the current one
or 3+ the current one... I mean if the kernel has gone through 5
rebuilds because of version changes do you really care about any of
the first 4?  They would all be untested and therefore potentially
unviable to boot.

&gt;<i> Kernel updates are not too frequent.
</I>&gt;<i> In most situations removal of the currently booted kernel, initramfs,
</I>&gt;<i> and modules
</I>&gt;<i> is not problematic because the box will have been up for a long time
</I>&gt;<i> and any kernel
</I>&gt;<i> module that would be required would have already been loaded.
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, this might not always be the situation.
</I>&gt;<i> However, keeping more than 4 kernels begins a problematic situation for
</I>&gt;<i> SAs that have /boot/ on a separate 2G file system,
</I>&gt;<i> which is recommended for boxes that boot using LUKS encryption
</I>&gt;<i> or use a file system for / that is not lilo compatible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This box actually has a 2G boot partitiion as the first on the disk too...

&gt;<i> So obviously, keeping an indefinite amount of legacy kernels and
</I>&gt;<i> modules is not a solution.
</I>&gt;<i> And lilo can store information for no more than approximately 16 labels.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, the best solution is probably to fix the box
</I>&gt;<i> so that it can reboot after a kernel update.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is not something to become upset about.
</I>&gt;<i> 15 years ago SAs were having lilo configuration and booting problems
</I>&gt;<i> and even today it is possible to do so especially when the SA becomes
</I>&gt;<i> confused about what lilo installed where runs first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My recommendation is to have lilo install to the boot block of the
</I>&gt;<i> /boot/ partition
</I>&gt;<i> and use ms-sys to install a bootable master boot record to the primary
</I>&gt;<i> fixed disk.
</I>&gt;<i> That way when the box boots it first runs ms-sys
</I>&gt;<i> then ms-sys loads and runs the boot block of the first partition with
</I>&gt;<i> the bootable flag.
</I>&gt;<i> That should cause lilo to run.
</I>&gt;<i> And lilo should load the initramfs and kernel image.
</I>
unelss the initramfs failed :)

&gt;<i> Following that the kernel runs, mounts the initramfs on / and executes /init
</I>&gt;<i> That is a tiny summary of what happens after the power on self test.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fdisk program can be used to toggle the bootable flag on a partition.
</I>&gt;<i> Even if forgotten, the Sorcerer menu driven installer usually turns on
</I>&gt;<i> the bootable flag for the /boot partition.
</I>&gt;<i> So it should not be a problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some SAs want lilo installed in the MBR of a fixed disk.
</I>&gt;<i> That is fine also.
</I>&gt;<i> In the past I might have had reasons for not wanting that,
</I>&gt;<i> but I can not remember any of the reasons now.
</I>&gt;<i> Intentionally configuring lilo to install in the MBR solves the problem
</I>&gt;<i> of what lilo runs first by potentially overwriting a stale lilo
</I>&gt;<i> installed to the MBR.
</I>&gt;<i> If a stale lilo is installed to the MBR and Sorcerer installs lilo
</I>&gt;<i> fresh to the boot block of /boot or /
</I>&gt;<i> then that would become a definite reason why the box would not boot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, the box can be put into a state bootable from fixed disk.
</I>
ya I just have to boot a CD first.

&gt;<i> I only knew one SA that had a problem doing that more than a decade ago.
</I>&gt;<i> *lol*
</I>&gt;<i> He installed lilo to a floppy.
</I>&gt;<i> So the linux operating system installed on the fix disk
</I>&gt;<i> started it's initial booting from a floppy with lilo in the MBR.
</I>&gt;<i> But perhaps to us it was not the strangest solution since
</I>&gt;<i> we both started computing in the pre 80386 era
</I>&gt;<i> before computers came with fixed disks installed.
</I>&gt;<i> So we both had lots of experience with booting from floppy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, there probably is not a modern computer which
</I>&gt;<i> can not boot from fixed disk unless it has bad bugs in the BIOS.
</I>&gt;<i> If so then it can usually be repaired by a flash upgrade of the
</I>&gt;<i> motherboard BIOS to a newer version.
</I>&gt;<i> It might be worth a check to see if a newer version exists.
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck fixing the box.
</I>
Ya it's not luck though anymore :)

But really; why should it keep versions of the kernel that haven't
been booted?  and really the current should be kept laways in addtion
to the 4 (or reduce that to 2 prior to the current, the current and 1
new  (total of 4)... )
