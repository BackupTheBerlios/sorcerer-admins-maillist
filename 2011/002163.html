<PRE>Heh...

Just a bit later something destroyed /etc/init.d and /etc/rc.d

Without those two directories rebooting becomes...  interesting. I
still have no clue as to how that happened, and I pasted /etc from a
week ago over the hole where my /etc used to be. It's not a fix I am
too fond of, so now I am in the process of another rebuild to rebuild
the config files for everything that's installed now. Once that
succeeds I'll back up this file system.

Thanks for the tips. Next time I'll use the shutdown method to kill
all the running processes, and then be able to do the unmounting of
root.

On Solaris machines you can switch to runlevel 1, and it does pretty
much the same. Not that I get much time to play in that runlevel, our
production machines are usually very busy.

Don't you think it might be advantageous to have an init 7 command to
drop a user into the keep? Or maybe use init 1 to drop one back into
the keep without the shutdown trick.

Thanks again for the tips...

&gt;<i> That was close.
</I>&gt;<i> If the box is switched to runlevel 7
</I>&gt;<i> then all getty except the getty running on the keep terminate.
</I>&gt;<i> At that point the SA can use the killall command in
</I>&gt;<i> order to terminate all processes that are not in series
</I>&gt;<i> with their shell.
</I>&gt;<i> After that then all the binds on /media/root/ can be unmounted.
</I>&gt;<i> Then /media/root/ can be unmounted effortlessly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I tested that previously.
</I>&gt;<i> It was the reason for the addition of runlevel 7.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise the gettys running on the root filesystem
</I>&gt;<i> would pin it down.
</I>&gt;<i> So yes, that was very close.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another method for entrance into the keep
</I>&gt;<i> that probably accomplishes all of the above
</I>&gt;<i> is to do a
</I>&gt;<i> # shutdown -r now
</I>&gt;<i> Then, during the final countdown press &quot;s&quot; for sulogin
</I>&gt;<i> The sulogin would put the SA inside the keep
</I>&gt;<i> and since the only command after finale to run is reboot or halt
</I>&gt;<i> then /media/root should already be cleanly unmounted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Switching to runlevel 7 is my preference.
</I>&gt;<i> Using shutdown or reboot runlevels
</I>&gt;<i> has different benefits and costs. &#160;:)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The keep can do that which we want;
</I>&gt;<i> yet not without some practice.
</I>&gt;<i> In the above scenario the &quot;lsof&quot; command might prove useful
</I>&gt;<i> for seeing what processes are running that still have files
</I>&gt;<i> open on /media/root/ or filesystems bound or mounted within.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course killing gettys does not work.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, the SA must know about
</I>&gt;<i> or decide to check /etc/inittab
</I>&gt;<i> in order to learn about runlevel 7.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;In the keep&quot; training on a test box
</I>&gt;<i> prepares SAs for handling tense situations.
</I>&gt;<i> Wielding the power of the keep
</I>&gt;<i> is like the knowing how to cut with a sword.
</I>&gt;<i> If one does not learn in advance
</I>&gt;<i> then learning during combat may be too late a time
</I>&gt;<i> to discover one's cutting technique is insufficient.
</I>&gt;<i> While a SA expects the keep provides a root shell prompt
</I>&gt;<i> which is the same as any root prompt;
</I>&gt;<i> even so a bit of practice within the keep helps hone technique.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Sorcerer's keep is the ultimate vantage
</I>&gt;<i> for battling bugs on the root file system.
</I>&gt;<i> As the general of a box,
</I>&gt;<i> and the commander of the keep,
</I>&gt;<i> the SAs duty is to crush the bugs' siege
</I>&gt;<i> upon the real root file system.
</I>&gt;<i> To not know how to effectively bark commands
</I>&gt;<i> from the keep is to allow one's troops to be routed
</I>&gt;<i> and to have one's castle fall to the onslaught of bugs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A skilled SA with modest training in the keep should be
</I>&gt;<i> able to solve just about any problem without rebooting,
</I>&gt;<i> except kernel bugs and serious hardware problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And the keep can sometimes be a better option than rebooting.
</I>&gt;<i> /media/root can remain mounted until un-mounting is desirable.
</I>&gt;<i> That can be useful when /media/root might not be expected
</I>&gt;<i> to be remountable due to significant errors.
</I>&gt;<i> And rebooting can be delayed until the SA is certain that
</I>&gt;<i> the real root filesystem, lilo, and the initramfs are passable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in summary the keep is like a perfectly sharp katana.
</I>&gt;<i> In that respect the keep is is an excellent weapon
</I>&gt;<i> for waging war with bugs,
</I>&gt;<i> yet it is also a useless weapon
</I>&gt;<i> within hands that have yet to train with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I offer this advise not to rebuke anyone,
</I>&gt;<i> but rather to encourage SAs to periodically
</I>&gt;<i> invest 5 to 15 minutes of self training
</I>&gt;<i> to familiarize with new functionality of Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer is a distribution for senior level SAs.
</I>&gt;<i> That much said alone implies that the
</I>&gt;<i> the ability to eloquently wield awesome Sorcerer powers
</I>&gt;<i> goes only to SAs that make themselves worthy.
</I>&gt;<i> I know Sorcerer SAs are worthy.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise sharing this distro would be pointless.
</I>&gt;<i> So all that is required is a bit of fun-time self training.
</I>&gt;<i> And then nearly all tasks will solve nearly effortlessly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Self-training, making backups, and a dev/testing box
</I>&gt;<i> on every production LAN are necessary evils
</I>&gt;<i> for keeping prime uptime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We owe Evert thanks for sharing the experience.
</I>&gt;<i> From his humility and compassion
</I>&gt;<i> we receive an example of how wielding power from the keep
</I>&gt;<i> is proportional to the SAs experience within the keep.
</I>&gt;<i> There is no shame in Evert's experience.
</I>&gt;<i> The Sorcerer's keep is very new.
</I>&gt;<i> Many SAs have probably yet to even try it.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, sharing this experience imparts motivation
</I>&gt;<i> to master the mysteries of the keep.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As the prime SA of Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> I wish that I could be able to magically loan
</I>&gt;<i> my lore to SAs during their times of need.
</I>&gt;<i> But as we already know
</I>&gt;<i> modern magic does not work that way.
</I>&gt;<i> The keep is not merely the ultimate vantage for battling bugs.
</I>&gt;<i> The keep's existence is a gift to Sorcerer SAs
</I>&gt;<i> that demonstrates my faith that all Sorcerer SAs are worthy.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, please train with the tools and become powerful SAs.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi there...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ah, I flattened a multilib box into a pure 64 bit install by accident.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, in wanting to go back to Multilib I wanted to just mount my root
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partition somewhere, wipe it, and restore from an earlier backup that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was known good.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I stopped most processes, and then Alt-F7 into my &quot;keep&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately, /media was read-only, I did not have enough time to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, I whipped out the Sorcerer I/R and once booted, just mkfs.ext4 on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the affected partition, mount, restore, lilo, reboot and I was back up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and running in about 20 minutes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This would be a killer cool feature if an SA can restore ROOT without

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :D
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was so close, too. :(

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I recently gave a nickname to the Sorcerer's initramfs.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I call it the keep of the Sorcerer's castle.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The name is appropriate in many ways.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However, thus far the potential of the keep is mostly untapped.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> After booting completes only /sbin/init and /sbin/agetty continue
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> running from the keep.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I was discussing with Evert that perhaps udev should remain running on the keep
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and that also the system logger program should run from the keep.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Processes running in the keep have both benefits and drawbacks.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> First, the process is not likely to be reading or writing to files that exist
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> on a filesystem attached to a physical device.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Therefore, processes running from the keep
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are unlikely to become zombies or freeze
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in the event of a serious disk or serious file system error.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However, if the system logger runs from the keep
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> then it would write files to a tmpfs that would also be bound
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> somewhere in /var/log/ so that it can be viewed from both places.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> No inconvenience with that.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The first and most obvious drawback is that the system logs eat swap.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> A box that keeps a years worth of system logs,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> without rebooting, might eat a lot of swap.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Apparently, that is not a problem with metalog.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also if a box reboots or shutdown unexpectedly rather
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> than using the proper method
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> then the content of the logs would be lost.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The most obvious method to avoid that is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to have the system logger also output over the network
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to a logger listening on a different box.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And at least 9 out of 10 times when a box loses power suddenly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there is no clue in the on disk system log as to what happened.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Lost system logs could be annoying for other reasons,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but on a box operating perfectly normal
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> then a system log would not be lost.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Switching udev to running from keep I have mostly decided upon.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Whether or not to switch system loggers is yet undecided.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I pose the question on the list in order to gather insight from Sorcerer SAs.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Some SAs might know reasons for why that change would be very undesirable.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In contrast, I prefer a system log that runs
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> no-matter-what-except-sudden-power-loss. &#160;:)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Since Sorcerer boxes use the keep both during boot and shutdown
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we should also consider what process we want
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to start and continue running on the keep.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For example, the keep is currently inaccessible when we ssh into a box.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But what if sshing into the box is not working?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Might we want to be able to ssh into the keep?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So should sshd also be running on the keep
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but accessible on a different port?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe TCP port 30 since it lacks an assignment in /etc/services ?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> No matter what new bugs may lay siege
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to a box when installed software is updated;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the keep remains as potential last point of retreat.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It is a zone of safety from which problems
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can be carefully examined and solved
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> without being mired in the battlefield on /media/root/
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So how should we fortify the keep?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Besides ssh and scp
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> what other useful programs and libraries
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> should be moved into the keep?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What processes should be started in the keep and remain running?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Since the initramfs is being retained as the central &quot;keep&quot; of our
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Sorcerer's castle
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we should grown accustomed to the idea that it is a valid file system
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for running
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> processes, daemons, and services.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What benefits most from running inside the keep?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What deserves the honor?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for making a moment to consider it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> No urgent requirement to rack one's brain.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For over a decade the initrd and initramfs was considered
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a filesystem to be discarded after booting.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That habit of thought is not easily discarded.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yet if something useful pops into mind
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> then please share it.
