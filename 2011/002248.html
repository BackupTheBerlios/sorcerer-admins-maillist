<PRE>I made improvements to immune-sentinel-space.

# /etc/init.d/sentinel-space configure

Presents a list of percentages to select
for the amount of RAM for xz to use when compressing tarballs.
The entire amount of RAM selected
is not guaranteed to be used each time.
However, allowing sufficient RAM allowd xz to create
a dictionary window the size of the tarball being compressed.

For example, linux tarball compressed in 1 block
is smaller than a linux tarball compressed in 2 blocks.
The main reason that xz can compress files smaller
than bzip2 is because bzip2
uses a fixed block size while compressing.
bzip2's maximum block size is 900K.

In contrast we already know xz can use 65M
when compressing with parameter -9.
However, with proper parameters
xz can also use several gigabytes of RAM.

Because I keep many tarballs,
I prefer to use a large amount of RAM
on my workstation for compressing tarballs.
Most of the time the RAM is available
and used for little other than disk caching.

I am setting the default at 10%.
The size is reasonable.
immune-sentinel-space runs in the idle cgroup.
When competing for the CPU
immune-sentinels-space receives
about 1/512 of the CPU cycles.
Therefore, it can take it's time.

The maximum value I am allowing is 80%
Keep in mind that compressing with such
a large amount of RAM also increases
the amount of CPU cycles required.
Therefore, xz could eat 80% of RAM for
a much longer duration than the default setting of 10%.
Selecting 80% could be unwise.

Compression programs, such as xz,
do pattern matching across a large span of RAM.
Consequently, compression programs are effectively non-swappable.
Any memory used by the compression program that is swapped
must be read back into RAM almost immediately.
Please keep that in mind when selecting a value greater than 50%.

Changing the settings will not re-compress tarballs
that are already compressed with xz.
It only effects new tarballs that arrive uncompressed
or are compressed with gzip and/or bzip2.

Difficult to anticipate where this improvement will be of much use.
Using large portions of RAM gains perhaps between 5% and 50%
compression improvement on large tarballs.
On small tarballs no improvement is gained because
tarballs under 8M already compress in a single block.
Here is the default from xz's manual page on the table of presets:

Preset   DictSize   CompCPU   CompMem   DecMem
-6       8 MiB       6       94 MiB    9 MiB

The default of setting of 10%
for immune-sentinel-space on a box with 1G of RAM
achieves nearly the same performance as xz's defaults.
However, on a 4G box...

Preset   DictSize   CompCPU   CompMem   DecMem
-8      32 MiB       6      370 MiB   33 MiB
-9      64 MiB       6      674 MiB   65 MiB

The performance allowed is somewhat better than present -8

xz being able to determining memory consumption by a percentage
is a nice improvement over using tradition preset values.
This way no understanding of a table is required.
And selecting an undesirable preset
that forces the box into infinite swapping mode is not possible.
Consequently, I wanted to upgrade immune-sentinel-space
so that SAs can enjoy benefits without having to
read xz manual pages and documentation
in order to make a decision.
Enjoy.
