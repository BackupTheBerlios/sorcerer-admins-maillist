<PRE>Just a few days ago I was thinking,
&quot;Do lilo errors happen anymore?
I have not had a lilo error in what seems like almost forever.&quot;
And then earlier today it happened!

I did not properly anticipate that /etc/init.d/lilo
could be running concurrently with itself
and be so precisely synchronized
as to write to the configuration file concurrently
and thus insert too many label statements.
And yet that 1 in a million bug happened.
lilo refused to re-install
That box failed to boot.

If I had been anywhere around the box while it was shutting down
then I would have seen the problem and been able to make
the sulogin timeout.
I could have prevented the problem if I was there.
Or if I had remembered to cast sorcerer-rescue
then a rescue label would have been installed.
And that also would have granted that one bootable label.
But alas I did not plan ahead.
My conclusion is that Sorcerer's init system
is insufficient to match the true laziness of a SA.
Consequently, the Sorcerer init system must be improved.

First, directory /var/log/boot/ is now called /var/log/init/
That is because it records logs generated
both during booting and all run level changes.
Yes, the old name of /var/log/boot/ did not last long.

Additionally, there are two new sub-directories:
/var/log/init/{failed,passed}
Each gathers individual files.
Each file's file name is the base name
of the init-script that was run.
The first line of each file is the command line.
The following lines are the output from the init-script.
Naturally, if an init-script fails then it's log file goes into
/var/log/init/failed/
That makes both the outcome and reason easy to view.

This change is useful because it allows the box
to anticipate and react to problems.
If the box anticipates that it
should be unable to boot following a restart or shutdown command
then the box will refuse to restart and refuse to shutdown.
It also refuses repeated attempt.
And it will not allow reboot/shutdown requests to complete
until after the SA logs in and solves the problem
that probably involves lilo or a file in /etc/lilo/
A failed attempt at reboot/shutdown causes the box
to rebound to runlevel 3 with a message appended to
the getty's greeting on virtual console #7.

What is the beauty of a belligerent box?

Please entertain the hypothetical situation that someone
is actually rebooting a Sorcerer box.
# shutdown -r now
# ^D
wait a minute...
# ssh ....
# uptime

Is the uptime insignificant?
If so then it reboot.
If not then there was a problem.
This seems a much better outcome
than having a box located on another continent
fail to reboot and become inaccessible by ssh.
It is an outcome that I can appreciate,
because problems are easier to solve via ssh
than by analog telephone conversation.

So more simply put,
&quot;This change minimizes the probability that box will be unable to boot.&quot;

Hopefully, this change improves the robustness of Sorcerer init.
Unlike &quot;sorcerer-rescue&quot;,
which is a spell that must be installed,
this boon requires no additional cost in effort nor disk space.
And the amount of complexity added to the init system is minimal.
No overhaul of init-scripts is required.
So the benefit comes at a cost
which is transparent to SAs and spell authors.

The Sorcerer &quot;keep&quot; is the foundation for these improvements.
This new functionality demonstrates that the &quot;keep&quot; grants
an additional benefit of being able to fully audit
and react to the outcome of events during boot and shutdown.

If other init-scripts deserve consideration during shutdown/reboot
then please reply with the recommendations.


Thanks to all the SAs that participated in this year's and last year's
conversations about how Sorcerer's init system should be improved.
Some suggestions were towards making init more interactive.
Other suggestions were making towards making it more reactive
instead of merely doing fire and forget on init-scripts.

And due to recent changes Sorcerer init is now more interactive.
At the last very point before halting or rebooting
a SA can request the box to immediately rebound to a runlevel,
provide a shell, or pause the final countdown.
And Sorcerer init is more reactive in being able to detect
the failed outcome of an init-script and anticipate the potential
for a failed boot and avoid that potential by rebounding to runlevel 3.

These changes demonstrate that specific hindrances to Sorcerer
robustness can be individually handled with an implementation
that does not scrap the current foundation of System V style init
nor incur a penalty of increased complexity.

Some requests are still on the cutting board.
The current init system does not grant SAs
the ability to individually confirm the execution
of each of more than 100 init-scripts.
Obviously, that makes booting and/or shutdown
tedious while the potential benefit
is not immediately apparent.
Would it increase robustness?
I do not know.

However, changes that address specific problems
are definitely receiving worthy implementations.
Unfortunately, Sorcerer boxes are not clones.
And all potential problems can not be anticipated.
Therefore, a flawless boot solutions is unrealistic.
However, some distribution wide
implementations can be made for
avoiding problems that can be properly anticipated.

Who still has an itch with Sorcerer's init
that could use a decent scratch, please?
