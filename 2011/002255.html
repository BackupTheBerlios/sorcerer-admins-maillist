I wrote and abandoned 4 implementations for implementing timeouts on
init-scripts.
The most recent implementation was fun.
A sentinel that runs only during sysinit and runlevel
monitors and kill off init-scripts that continue running
after a pre-determined time limit.
It was an efficient implementation, but perhaps a bit complex.

I abandoned the implementation when I remembered
that a new version of coreutils installed a program called timeout.
And using that program to run init-scripts is an efficient simple method
to enforce either a specified or default timeout for all init-scripts
run during sysinit and runlevel.

The default timeout will be 1 hour.
Yes that may seem excessively long.
Yet 1 hour should be long enough to fsck file systems
and/or to synchronize RAIDs.
And if a remotely located box appears to hang during boot
then I typically wait an hour before reporting the problem
to someone who can identify and fix the problem locally.
Yet that type of problem is not caused by a Sorcerer init-script.
However, if a remotely located Sorcerer box were to hang during boot
then I rather it boot an hour later than for it to hang forever.

init-scripts gain a new implicit function called timeout.
Consequently, timeout 300 could be added to an init-script
to ensure that it receives a 5 minute timeout instead of the 1 hour default.
The added functionality comes with minimal complexity.
Unfortunately, /bin/timeout
executes the term and kill without providing
any notification to the system logger.

How is that for a start?
