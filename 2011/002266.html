That sounds good.
Glad Sorcerer can benefit from someone with experience
using Github and google code.
It is all still uncharted territory for me.
While I tend to prefer to hog all the fun to myself
I see the logic in deferring to someone with more experience.

Also I feel very pleased when SA volunteer for a Sorcerer sub-project.
I appreciatively accept Scruff's proposal
for transitioning email list and repository services.
Please continue to inform of us the progress.
I will eagerly await URLs to necessary documentation for reading
and sites where I must sign-in and register
so that I can make updates to the repository, etc...
Hopefully, the cronjob run scripts at sorcerer.silverice.org
will not require much adjustment in order to make the transition
to a repository hosted elsewhere.
Thanks to Scruffy's advance scouting
the transition will probably be easy if not almost fun.

As far as the new email list is concerned,
everyone who is interested should be able to register.
This makes sense, since everyone will require an account:password
in order to control their registration.
As far as svn goes, only those who make contributions
and/or correct existing spells require write access.
Therefore, Jan Merka, Evert Vorster, and myself definitely require access.
Everyone else write an email to Scruff with a CC to me
with an explanation of why access is required.
At least that much is required for approval, because
the massive amount of people with access to svn
makes the repository the weakest point of security in Sorcerer.
Those with write access to the repository
must also first acquire the trust of Sorcerer SAs,
and especially myself.

Access to boxes such as sorcerer.silverice.org
is extremely limited and therefore considerably
less likely to become a point of vulnerability.
Probably before 2011 those boxes will
be sealed with the enhanced security provided by
the spell immune-security-tomoyo.
Services hosted externally such as at google
might be at a greater security risk,
but the separation helps bolster the security
of boxes hosting primary services.
Consequently, a compromise of a single service
will not necessarily compromise other services.

So far in Sorcerer history
there has been but only one single significant compromise
that cost all of our services hosted at savannah.org.
As typical it was a compromise not due to a bug, but due to misplaced trust.
So please remember that Sorcerer is not a distribution that achieves progress
through competition, but rather through cooperation.
I do not want that to cast a dark shadow,
and yet one exists therefore
I explicitly beg that those who acquire trust
remember that their privilege is for the benefit
of serving all Sorcerer SAs.
Trust is not merely an honor, but also a responsibility.
