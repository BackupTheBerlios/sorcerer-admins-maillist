<PRE>I only said that Sorcerer needs modern hardware because I made it run
on a Pentium III a while ago.

It was painful to watch, and took far too long to compile anything.
Then the UI was sluggish and so on.

So, while it IS possible, it's not for the feint of heart, and useful
only in the same way that horse-riding is a useful mode of
transportation.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not to imply that I am always correct.
</I>&gt;<i> But definitely I was wrong and Evert was correct.
</I>&gt;<i> Linux is bootable on ancient computers,
</I>&gt;<i> however the specifications for Sorcerer requires
</I>&gt;<i> the stock configuration of a more modern box.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet, I sometimes expect that
</I>&gt;<i> I can make Sorcerer run
</I>&gt;<i> even on 10 year old athletic shoes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was among the many SAs that were displeased
</I>&gt;<i> about relinquishing a custom kernel
</I>&gt;<i> that boots quickly without an initramfs.
</I>&gt;<i> As a compromise
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted an initramfs with nearly all the utilities that
</I>&gt;<i> SAs would require in order to rescue or repair a box.
</I>&gt;<i> That compromise best approximates the advantages
</I>&gt;<i> enjoyed on a box that can boot without initramfs.
</I>&gt;<i> And since Sorcerer boxes are
</I>&gt;<i> required to have sufficient installed RAM
</I>&gt;<i> then why not make optimal use of it?
</I>&gt;<i> That is why the Sorcerer initramfs is large instead of tiny.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My plan for a large initramfs was
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the opposite of what all other distros were creating.
</I>&gt;<i> They wanted tiny initramfs.
</I>&gt;<i> They were trying to cut down the loadout of an initramfs
</I>&gt;<i> to essential boot only utilities provided by busybox
</I>&gt;<i> or other utilities suitable for use in embedded systems.
</I>&gt;<i> And they were using tiny cut down
</I>&gt;<i> C library implementations such as uClibc or klibc.
</I>&gt;<i> And yet in stark contrast
</I>&gt;<i> the Sorcerer I/R has real glibc,
</I>&gt;<i> a full selection of kernel modules, firmware,
</I>&gt;<i> and large useful slice of the installed operating system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps this is interesting or perhaps not,
</I>&gt;<i> but sometimes Sorcerer does
</I>&gt;<i> very much the opposite of what other distros are doing.
</I>&gt;<i> And again Sorcerer continues the defiant trend
</I>&gt;<i> by taking the extreme to the next step.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer might be the only distro that
</I>&gt;<i> keeps the initramfs that was used during boot;
</I>&gt;<i> allows SAs to use the initramfs while the box is running;
</I>&gt;<i> and to uses the initramfs again during reboot/shutdown.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The bold step in this direction of embracing the utility
</I>&gt;<i> instead of minimizing and discarding
</I>&gt;<i> what others expect is a waste of memory;
</I>&gt;<i> also burns the bridge that leads backwards
</I>&gt;<i> to a possibility of becoming a distribution
</I>&gt;<i> that runs on legacy computers.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer boxes require 256M to boot, 512M to install,
</I>&gt;<i> but should have no less than 1G for deployment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorcerer methods often defy the current norms.
</I>&gt;<i> They seem counter-intuitive.
</I>&gt;<i> And the evolution of Sorcerer's init is a good example.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet what seem defiant now might become the norm for the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Foolish or coolish?
</I>&gt;<i> At least we can give it a try,
</I>&gt;<i> and with sufficient retrospect decide.
