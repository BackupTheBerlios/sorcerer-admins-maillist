<PRE>I completed more test for tighter integration between tomoyo and sorcery.
cast can compile software and do destdir installation within the sorcery domain.
Therefore, during execution of:
./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install

/tmp/  /usr/src/  are the only write-able locations.

This change is not a security measure.
When security is a concern
then untrusted software should not be installed.

The use of a custom domain for executing the compilation of software
prevents modification of files in the real root filesystem.
This is desirable in order to prevent the creation of alien files
and unexpected modification of installed files.

Some software authors might accidentally or intentionally
allow their software to do undesirable modifications to installed files.
In the past one of the most significant culprits was pjproject.
pjproject modified header files from several other installed software projects
including glibc's /usr/include/err.h
Naturally, these modifications happened before the make install.
Therefore, the modified header files
did not become shared installed files.
pjproject stealthily sabotaged header files
which caused compile errors in other software.
The problem would continue until effected software upgraded
or until sorcery's immune system detects and corrects the modified files.

cast using a domain for software compilation ensures
that a installed/modified file will be tracked
and owned by the spell that modified/installed it.
Therefore, tomoyo will automatically
deny attempts to modify files in the root file system during compilation.
Tomoyo thwarts pjproject and software projects that do stealthy sabotage.

Yes alternate methods to accomplish this goal exist.
A preloaded library
can filter library calls in software
that is dynamically linked with glibc.
Yet a pre-loaded library can be thwarted.
And a preloaded library is not usable on multilib Sorcerer,
because the software being run during compilation
might be ELF 32-bit or ELF 64-bit.
The compiler which is run is always ELF 64-bit on multilib Sorcerer.
Therefore, much ELF 64-bit software, such as make, ld, gcc, ccache, etc...
runs during ELF 32-bit compilation on a multilib box.

A method using a fuse file system and chroot was discussed for this task.
Unfortunately, it introduces undesirable complexity and overhead.
An implementation involving fuse
to replace the preloaded sentinel library
nearly became the alternative
to the revision to DESTDIR style installation.
Because dispel had to run before &quot;make install&quot;
and make modifications to the real root file system
this method became somewhat problematic
for exiting the chroot of the virtual file system
acting as a proxy for the real root file system.
However, I very much liked this method and almost chose it
over the near impossible task of rewriting and testing
every spell in the grimoire in order to support DESTDIR style installation.

A method using a tomoyo domain
in order to block modifications to the real root file system
incurs no apparent performance deficit.
tomoyo runs efficiently in kernel space.
Therefore, boxes gain the boon
for almost no additional cost
in speed and complexity.

Some people might call this modification a &quot;sandbox.&quot;
However, tomoyo is no playground.
Incarceration within a domain is not elective.
Incarceration is mandatory and inescapable.
Forget the image of a sandbox.
Imagine a high security prison.

Although inescapable this domain is not a security feature.
A spell that properly installs /bin/su or other sensitive files
will be able to disrupt, compromise and sabotage a box.
However, the modification will be tracked
since the modified files must be installed
by using the DESTDIR method.
Therefore, the install logs for spells will accurately
report which spell installed what file.

Therefore, at best a domain for sorcery
will help block the appearance of aliens by that method.
Yet there are still nearly an unlimited amount of additional
methods by which aliens can appear on box.
There poorly design software exists that creates aliens when run.
system-config-printer writes files to /usr/share/system-config-printer/
xkeyboard-config that writes files to /usr/share/X11/xkb/compiled/
Yes I make myself irritated by this because
when I detect it I must write exceptions in domains to allow it.
But that is entirely a different discussion.
