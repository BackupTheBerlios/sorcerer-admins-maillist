<PRE>Thanks for sharing an opinion.
I harbor a nearly unspoken apprehension
that selecting tomoyo for enhanced security
is a bet on the underdog.
selinux has growing support in the kernel
and in core applications.
However, tomoyo development also
published plans through linux kernel 3.2.x.y

Originally, I would have sided with grsecurity,
but somehow it failed to put a foot in linux's door.
An implementation available in vanilla linux gains considerable favor.
Having kernel updates delayed
because of the late arrival of third party patches
was a pain we have avoided for years.
And tomoyo is in many respects like grsecurity,
but without the uberuser password and other stuff.

I was discussing tomoyo with Evert.
I do not want to put words in Evert's mouth.
Please correct me if I am wrong.
However, I gained the impression that Evert's opinion
was that the standard security model is fine.

And I agree with that also.
There is nothing wrong with the standard security
model of having root with awesome privileges
and users under oppressive restrictions.  :)
root/user security is easy to understand.

Unfortunately, the standard security model
makes no consideration nor provisions
for the possibility of someone acquiring
an effective user identity of 0
without having properly authenticated.
If a user exploits a bug in a process running with EUID 0
or exploits a bug in a SUID executable file
then a user may be able to gain root
without having authenticated as root.

This is a scenario that we should all want to avoid.
However, in accordance with reality
the event should be anticipated and handled.
A nefarious user rooted one of my boxes
with a vixie-cron exploit more than a decade ago!
So, yes I also was embarrassingly victimized long ago.
Encountering a terrible user is as inevitable as a rainy day.
Therefore, we should prepare for and anticipate a hostile attack
just as we bring an umbrella on a day when rain is anticipated.

Consequently, I am implementing tomoyo in a fashion that
neither improves nor modifies the model of security
that we already approve of.
Rather I want to enforce it.

Effectively, there will be two domains
most processes will run in the &quot;restricted&quot; domain.
The restricted domain has as much privilege
as a user or service would normally require.
However, it does not receive privilege to modify files in
/bin /boot /etc /lib{,64} /opt /sbin /usr
To achieve entry into the &quot;freedom&quot; domain
one must run a program such as sulogin or sudo
and provide credentials.
Upon entering the freedom domain
one gains all the amazing privileges that one expects for root.
Of course one must still gain EUID 0
before enjoying the privilege.
sulogin does that.
I am yet undecided concerning sudo.
And su is out of the question since it does not
ask for a password when one's EUID is already 0

Too simple, yes?
In addition to the two standard domains
I will create custom domains
for services expected to run on all Sorcerer boxes.
For example ntp will be in it's own tiny little box
that will allow no access that ntp would not normally do.
It will fit as tightly as any electronic straight jacket can.

However, I will not provide custom domains for
services such as httpd that have a wide variation
in how they are configured and how they run.
Instead services that are too expansive to effectively
confine in an electronic straight jacket
will run in the &quot;restricted&quot; domain.

The restricted domain limits the damage in a worst case scenario.
The box can not have a root kit installed.
And the box will successful survive reboot.

However, all files and directories in /home can be modified or wiped.
The unauthorized user can kill processes, run programs,
download software, run software that was not installed, etc..
Consequently, parts of /var, all of /home can be destroyed.
Yes, the inconvenience is considerable.
But perhaps the outcome is preferable to having the attacker
being able to burrow in like a tick and
conceal his activity by trojaning ps, top, and other programs?

Pardon me for repeating what I already wrote.
But I wanted to explicate the level of protection
that is provided by the &quot;restricted&quot; domain.

The possibility of protecting /home is difficult to implement.
And it might be almost easy to implement in linux version 3.2.x.y,
because domain transition can occur without execution.
But that is yet a long wait.

An interesting aspect about tomoyo domain rules
is that they can contain a \$ to indicate the $PID of a process.
Yet nothing about rules nor domain transition directly involves UID or EUID.
Domain transition is always accomplished through executing a file.
Consequently, the only way to protect individual home directories
is to have custom domains for each user.

I am contemplating the possibility.
However, I have not implemented it.
Custom domains for each user
is not difficult to create in advance.
And the list could be created dynamically
and loaded into the kernel when tomoyo
policies are normally loaded.
However, domain transition is problematic.

Successful authentication with login or sshd
typically runs the user's defined shell which
the user can change at whim.
There is no provision for running something
before that change domains.
Likewise transition to a user's custom domain for KDE
would not be impossible, but not easy.
The most likely possibility
would be to replace /opt/kde4/bin/startkde
with a wrapper that changes to the user's custom
domain before executing the real startkde.

So we might not gain good protection for /home
But some enhanced comprehensive protection is better than none.
So far I have managed to implement what I wrote above.
And while running sshd in the restricted domain
I managed to log via ssh using a user account.
The only aspects not working properly
involves cgroup related tasks.
But I may yet solve that.

Soon I will create additional rules for the restricted domain
that allow writing to audio devices, graphic devices,
input and other useful devices in /dev/
But of course no write access to disk devices will be permitted.

The restricted domain still requires considerable more development
before it becomes ready for production use.
However, I am feeling excited about tomoyo.

SMTP evolved to a current method that authenticates SMTP servers
to prevent mail with a forged domain address.
HTTP evolved to allow 2-way encryption and
authentication of the server by a 3rd party.
DNS gained TSIG.
TCP-IP gained IP security.
telnet and r* type utilities were replaced with ssh and scp.
All of that demonstrates the transition
from the assumed trusting nature of UNIX services
into beasts suitable for thrashing and thwarting nefarious users.
Given that perspective mandatory access control
provided by tomoyo is a natural evolution of local host security.

Even when implemented by a skilled SA
tomoyo is not a perfect solution.
Some services can be locked tighter than a safe.
The rest is ... well ... who knows.
It might be circumventable by a less than obvious manner.
Something such as binding part of the root elsewhere with mount --bind
will not work unless permitted as a rule.
Therefore mount --bind provides no quick escape from the glass box.

An important difference exists between selinux and tomoyo.
When selinux is placed into enforcement mode
then the rules must be perfect and everything pre-planned.
That is because selinux locks everything down at once.
In contrast tomoyo supports an unlimited amount of domains
that can each have it's individual policy that determines:
unenforced; learning mode; reported but not enforced; reported and enforced.

selinux is like automobile security by locking one's keys inside the car.
The only way to return to the inside is to smash a window,
or less metaphorically reboot a box in non-enforcement mode.
tomoyo is way more sane.
It is like having a club for the steering wheel,
a locking boot for the wheel,
a locking stereo mount,
and a 200 decibel alarm system.
one, none, all, or any combination can be used
to maintain a sane amount of security
with less than an insane amount of preparation.

The Sorcerer selinux sub-project died because
I was unwilling to contribute all the effort
required to make it work properly.
It seemed like every file on the box required
a security context to describe how it can be used.
That is hundreds of thousands of files.
And I complain about having to maintain
merely a few thousand spells.

With tomoyo I am already half way to production quality.
If nobody volunteers to assist
then I will probably have this complete soon anyway.
I was estimating about a week's worth of effort.
But I also estimated Sorcerer Sentient to require about a month
when it actually required about a quarter of the year.
So the tomoyo sub-project might eat the rest of the year,
but at least through current testing
I can already see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Sorry if that seemed like too much to say about tomoyo.
But I am still feeling excited about it.
I am anticipating the enjoyment of creating custom domains
that fit services as tight as an electronic straight jacket.
After bringing the tomoyo implementation on Sorcerer to production quality
then a Sorcerer SAs that deploys tomoyo
can become nearly lackadaisical about security
while realizing that when the rain comes
they are already under the umbrella.

I definitely want some protection for /home also
but I suppose we must wait until linux 3.2.x.y
to discover and wield tomoyo's new abilities.


The above information indicates the current status of the sub-project.
The final outcome may yet differ.
My tests from yesterday implemented 3 domains: root; daemon; user.
But transition is not easy from the daemon domain to the user domain
for services such as: kdm; xdm; sshd; login
And Evert made a good point about already being familiar
with a 2 domain concept of security, namely the root/user model.

Consequently, anyone is welcome to contribute suggestions
about how this implementation should develop.
I listened to Evert and am satisfied with the change.
Thanks.
Anyone else?

And one last thing:

&gt;<i> Everywhere I turn, every howto and tutorial I read, and every manual I
</I>&gt;<i> write; says to disable selinux before proceeding with anything
</I>&gt;<i> - -installing software,
</I>
No requirement for disabling tomoyo
or rebooting with enforcement disabled
will be required before updating installed software on Sorcerer.
Before running augur, cast, leech, dispel
then the SA must explicitly transition to the &quot;freedom&quot; domain.
The sorcery tools will then work like they normally do.
However, I am considering that cast
might run compilation in the &quot;restricted&quot; domain.
That will keep sneaky source trees from inserting aliens
into the file system or making unexpected changes
that would only eventually be detected and corrected
only by immune-exam-integrity.
Succinctly, the tomoyo implementation
will not be the pain in the reboot that selinux is.

Thanks.
After considering and writing about it
I am feeling better about favoring tomoyo.
I was feeling somewhat melancholy about the possibility
that nobody might be eager to try enhanced security
with tomoyo after I complete the sub-project.
But it might yet become something as useful as Linux-PAM.
And it should be more useful for true Sorcerer SAs than Sorcerer Sentient.
Glad to finally become motivated again in implementing some enhanced security.
I do not recall how many years elapsed since I played with grsecurity.
If not for the lack of timely kernel patches
then maybe grsecurity would have had a future on Sorcerer.
I am expecting much better from tomoyo.
