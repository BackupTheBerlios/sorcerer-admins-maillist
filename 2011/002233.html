<PRE>Unfortunately, my list of init-script improvements
is too long to complete anytime soon.
However, yesterday I scratched a small itch
concerning locale-archive generation.

glibc-locales spell is deprecated
locale-archive is created by an init-script,
during runlevel, in the background, using multiple processes.
The creation of locale-archives does not delay the completion of the runlevel.

Basically, on a quad core processor locale-archive creation
for a full set of locales is nearly 4x faster than using the
glibc-locales spell.
And the benefit of menu driven selection of locales is still available.
Here is how it works...

# /etc/init.d/lang configure
# /etc/init.d/locale-archive configure

init-script lang provides a dialog for selecting the value for
the LANG environment variable from the available locales.
Maybe I should have called the init-script LANG instead?

The locale-archive init-script is responsible for creating the locale-archive.
The &quot;configure&quot; parameter provides a menu for selecting individual locales.
A full set of locales requires about 94M and 1 minute to generate.
A custom set of locales might require less than 4M.

/etc/init.d/lang is potentially interactive when it starts.
Therefore, it should run during sysinit since sysinit
never executes init-scripts in parallel in the background.
/etc/init.d/locale-archive runs during runlevel.
locale-archive is worth creating.
But awaiting the outcome would be a waste of time.
Therefore, locale-archive is generated in the background.

The most apparent effect of this change is no effect,
or rather no waiting for glibc-locales to complete casting.
locale-archive only regenerates when obsolete or missing.
And it is all automatic.
If the SA forgets to set a LANG environment variable
then the opportunity is eventually presented to the SA during a boot.
That is an excellent convenience for sleepy overworked SAs
and SAs that that otherwise would not bother with internationalization
or might be unaware of how the choice is implemented on Sorcerer.

This change trims nearly 5 minutes
from the testing time for new Install/Rescue images
since the generation of a full set of locales involves no waiting.
It makes more efficient use of available CPU cycles during
and immediately after the first boot of a Sorcerer Sentient installation.
Therefore, I feel pleased to eliminate the glibc-locales spell.
