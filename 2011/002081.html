<PRE>I am still doing the audit of the grimoire.
I have reached libchewing.
That might be about half way through.
Initially I wanted all spells to have homepage
and documentation URLs.
However, with hindsight I have decided to include
much more information about software projects
than I did initially.

To give an idea of what I have in mind
please check out this rough draft of it at:
<A HREF="http://sorcerer64.silverice.org/docs.html">http://sorcerer64.silverice.org/docs.html</A>
Please pardon the table's obvious ugliness.

The idea is that the info() function can be invoked during
spell definition to supply additional information about
the spell such as &quot;home&quot; for homepage &quot;docs&quot; for documentation
wiki, forum, mail, bugs, FAQ, &quot;use&quot; for license, or whatever else seems good.
Then, SAs can extract that information from the grimoire index by using
# augur info
Or they can look at the website for hyperlinks.
Hopefully that will handle most questions regarding documentation.

Like any distribution; Sorcerer is more than 99% externally developed software.
Therefore, Sorcerer should not explain how to configure and use
software such as samba, bind, dhcp, and httpd that originate
from software projects that are entirely separate from Sorcerer.
Good documentation, forums, and email lists already exist for those
software projects.

However, one useful source of information regarding Sorcerer,
that is difficult to locate,
is the Sorcerer user created/updated wiki.
I remember Scruffy started one somewhere.
And it is a good idea to have documentation provided by SAs from their
perspective.
I want to add that to the sorcery spell as info.
Anyone remember where it is located please?

In the past I would have said that providing home page URLs was
sufficient for spells
and that SAs should search the homepage and world wide web for further
information.
However, I have decided that this enhanced functionality might be
welcomed by some
SAs that prefer to visually see that there are near infinite life
lines of assistance regarding
the software that is available for immediate installation on Sorcerer boxes.
Hopefully that much information combined with the Sorcerer wiki
should be enough for SAs to discover how to install, configure, and
use desired software.

These past few days I procrastinated the grimoire audit.
Definitely, I want to reach the end of it.
However, someone made an interesting request.
They want to test the x86_64 multilib Install/Rescue image.
Creating and testing the I/R was on my todo list
to begin following the grimoire audit.
So at fist I was uncertain whether I wanted to divide my effort.

Sorcerer SAs contribute however they see fit.
I do not bark out orders for subordinates.
However, the norm is for eager SAs to declare their ambition to start
a sub-project,
but then they never complete their sub-project.
That is understandable because everything worth doing to improve Sorcerer
is usually nothing less than a monumental task.
Writing documentation, auditing the grimoire, creating architecture ports,
designing a new website style, etc... they are all significantly time consuming.
So lately I have been declining SA requests that increase my load,
because I my todo list is huge.
However, I accepted this request.

Although I already tested, modified and fixed near 1000 library spells
to make x86_64 multilib possible;
the person who is beta testing the newer x86_64 I/R is Evert.
Way to go Evert!

I do not want heap on the pressure,
but rather for a moment grant the accolades that Evert deserves
for constantly providing good testing, bug reporting, suggested fixes,
and now for starting a monumental task of checking the new I/R
and installation to approve it's worthiness for production use.

I am excited to have the assistance.
I am pleased that someone like Evert participates in Sorcerer development.
While true enough there are many more people to give thanks to than
merely Evert;
I want to shout out a large thanks for the significant increase in effort and
time devote to Sorcerer quality this month.

I apologize if I have seem grumpy and uncooperative this month.
I sometimes become that way when
spending 1% of the time leading/delegating and 99% doing the work.
*grumble grumble* Someone has to do it. *grumble grumble*
However, I am feeling happier today.

Until about 3 months after the x86_64 multilib Install/Rescue is released
please direct information regarding that to Evert and he will process
that and convey my way what I need to know.
Effectively, this appoints him as head of the Sorcerer x86_64 multilib
sub-project.
And since I already devoted considerable effort
thethe evolution of Sorcerer x86_64 to Sorcerer x86_64 multilib
is expected to happen.
However, the high quality of this transition
will most likely be due to Evert's effort.

Many transitions in Sorcerer come with a slight or moderate bump or scrape,
while expecting that the gain in the long run will be worth the momentary pain.
However, I have a good feeling that the quality of Sorcerer x86_64 multilib
will be nearly all gain and no pain.
That is because Evert's usual contribution is in the role of grimoire guru
with an emphasis on quality control.
Rather than check in new releases of software
Evert spots and crusades against bugs.

I tend to ignore buggy releases of software.
Not updating the stable version of software to a buggy release
is my normal mode of operation.
Yet that is reasonable for me because
I must update thousands of spells each year.
However, Evert will spot bugs and then correctly
go to the software author's homepage, forums, emails,
or use whatever means is necessary in order to do battle
to have annoying bugs fixed.
This is amazing effort because communicating with
the software developers to fix a bug usually requires
more than one simple email request.
Therefore, I am very pleased with Evert's ability to go
the extra distance to improve quality.

Those who do not yet know Evert
should know that he is the person
often quietly championing the cause of SAs
doing battle with the software authors for the elimination of bugs.
Yet now he is also doing testing and quality control for
the Sorcerer x86_64 multilib sub-project.


So in summary:
  anyone with an interest in Sorcerer x86_64 multilib
    should report to Evert for information or delegation of duties;
  anyone who remembers where the Sorcerer wiki page is
    please report that to me also along with any other useful
    pages SAs have created for Sorcerer so those can be added
    as info for sorcery or info for the grimoire if it pertains to
spell writing;
  lastly, if anyone has a taste for the mundane work
    and agrees that providing lots of informational URLs for software
    projects is an excellent idea
    then they can contact me to be delegated
    a portion of the grimoire for this task.



P.S.

For those who are wondering Sorcerer x86_64 multilib
is not merely am ambitious sub-project,
but 3 working installations of it already exist.
Hopefully, by the time the new I/Rs are rolled
the quality will be enterprise/production level ready.
