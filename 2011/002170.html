<PRE>The reason for having the separate augur commands for:
# augur sync
# augur newer
# augur update
was understood only by SAs
that understood the significance
of the &quot;grimoire,&quot; &quot;sorcery,&quot; and other installed &quot;spells.&quot;

However, not all SAs want to understand.
They wanted to execute
a single command updates
all the installed software on a box.
That was why I eventually created
# augur easy

However, after a significant elapse of time
I decided that I am no longer satisfied with
the implementation of
# augur sync

Consequently, I redesigned
# augur sync
to replace
# augur easy

And hindsight suggests that I should
have implemented it that way from the start,
although I never use
# augur easy

# augur sync
now updates all installed software on a box.

This seems easier to grasp than
having several commands
used when updating a box.

The next anticipated question is...
&quot;What command updates only
the installed grimoire and installed sorcery?&quot;

# augur begin grimoire

# augur newer
is still available.
However, most SAs will not invoke it.
Additionally, it queues spells with a current
time stamp instead of a future time stamp.

# augur easy
is deprecated.
However, it will still invoke
# augur sync
for 6 months.

# augur update
is deprecated.
However, it will still invoke
# augur begin
for 6 months.

Deprecated augur command module
are removed after 6 months.

# augur configure was modified.
Previously, it configured spells that
were provided as command line parameters,
that were provided on stdin,
or were already queued in the cast queue.
However, it now also grants complimentary
configuration for all installed software.

Here is a simple example.
Let us assume that the aumix spell is already installed.

# augur forget opts aumix; augur configure

augur presents a question
allowing confirmation or denial
of the use of gtk+ during the compilation of aumix.

Therefore,
# augur configure
enables a SA to both check and configure
all installed spells and gain assurance that
no pending configuration questions
involving installed spells are left unanswered.

However, there might be only one spell
in the entire grimoire that is unable to cast
without the SA first answering configuration questions.
That spell would be linux-custom
Therefore, what sorcery does not know
will normally not hurt it.
It will conjecture for itself which optionals to enable
when the SA has not supplied a previous answer.

And now for the summary.
# augur sync
replaces the functionality of
# augur easy

# augur update
and
# augur easy
will entirely vanish in 6 months

# augur begin grimoire
is an alternative to
# augur easy
in order to prevent additional spells
from being added to the cast queue.

These changes better approximate
how augur grimoire and sorcery
should have been implemented years ago.
However, I am always hesitate about changing
the code and interface that involves
how boxes are updated.
That is why I originally implemented
# augur easy
as an entirely separate command
instead of revising
# augur sync
That eliminated the probability that adding
# augur easy
would break
# augur sync
# augur newer
and
# augur update

However, I am now accepting the risk
of derailing Sorcerer boxes in order
to make updating an easy concept
for new Sorcerer SAs to learn and accomplish.

I hope that everyone can be happy about this change.
Nothing is being sacrificed,
except for potential confusing concerning
which commands should be executed
in order to update installed software.

# augur sync

That command alone is sufficient.
Remember that the action happens in the background.
So follow with
# augur scry
to enjoy the show.

I apologize in advance for any boxes that
I accidentally derail.
Best to check that boxes are still updating automatically
or as expected in a week from now.

These changes will require approximately two days
before they reach most Sorcerer boxes.
Because I tend to derail updating of Sorcerer boxes
approximately once every 3 to 4 years
please remain vigil because
there is no more probable time that now
for me to derail the distribution.
And I will try to be very careful to not break it.
