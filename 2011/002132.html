<PRE>Perhaps on x86_64 boxes that have prelink installed
following the update to glibc version 2.13
afterwards programs such as rm and perl segmentation fault when run.
Or perhaps their segmentation faulting begins after they recompile?
Exactly what programs segmentation fault might vary.
The solution appears to be to uninstall prelink
then recompile any programs that seem to segmentation fault.

prelink does not come pre-installed,
but might be installed on some boxes.
So the problem might not be wide spread.
Also I have not confirmed this problem exist
on any other box besides my workstation.
So it might not be a distribution wide problem.

However, if encountered then the solution of
dispelling prelink and recasting segfaulty software
seems to be the solution.

When I spotted this problem and went after it
I also decided to have a look at aliens
which was why the NVIDIA-Linux-x86* spells were revised.
Sorcerer boxes should not have aliens except
where they are expected to be found.
Some aliens exist in /etc/ /boot/ /var/
Aliens should not exist in /lib/ /lib64/ /bin/ /sbin/ /usr/
However, /usr/local/ might contain some aliens
if the SA installed anything there.
However, spells are not permitted to install files into /usr/local/

Remember to cast &quot;sorcery-alien&quot;
periodically and review the compile log
in order to determine if aliens require extradition.
