Something similar is mentioned at:
<A HREF="http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2011-March/150031.html">http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2011-March/150031.html</A>

Providing tmpfs on /var/lock/ and /var/run/
was never an issue on Sorcerer.
I would not expect that any distribution had that problem.
Yet apparently that insurmountable problem
is the reason why at least 4 distributions
are switching to providing tmpfs on /run/

Sorcerer's reason for capitulating
with udev software developers
is to avoid the potential of future problems
involving udev and perhaps other software projects
that expect tmpfs on /run/
Sorcerer policy typically yields power
to both software developers and SAs
rather than creating and enforcing
contrary distribution wide policies.

The reason for providing information about /run/
is so that Sorcerer SAs do not surmise that /run/
was created for no apparent benefit
by the introduction of a bug in an init-scripts.
If I did not know about the change
then I would suspect a bug.
Because after decades of using /var/run/
this change seems entirely unexpected.

Fortunately, /var/run and /var/lock continue to exist
as symbolic links that point into /run/
Therefore, SAs will not be left wondering where
process identification files are vacationing.
It is the only reasonable solution since
/var/run/ and /var/lock/ can not be immediately deprecated
since thousands of software projects
use /var/run/ to store their PID files.

LSB authors want to their way.
Software developers want their way.
Distribution maintainers want their way.
The Japanese language has a word for this.
&#19977;&#12388;&#12393;&#12418;&#12360;&#12398;&#25126;&#12356;.
In English it sounds like mitsu domoe no tatakai.
It would a sumou battle with three wrestlers.
Or in a less specific sense it is a 3 way fight/battle/struggle.
Discovering which group wields the most power
might yet become entertaining.

The introduction of /run/
solves no problems on Sorcerer.
Therefore, the new policy has 0 boons.

However, the introducing /run/
while providing symbolic links for /var/lock and /var/run
hints that the ultimate goal is to depreciate the legacy directories.
Removal of the legacy directories would cause problems
for 1000+ of software projects that are designed to have
their PID files in /var/run/
Therefore, the new policy has at least 1000 potential banes.

0 boons to 1000 of banes makes the /run/ policy illogical.
I wonder if the LSB committee will see it that way?
I wonder what software project after udev will next expect and use /run/ ?

I am surprised that udev authors did not entirely
remove support for their legacy method of using /dev/.udev/
In the past udev software authors make changes
then all boxes that do not comply with the new methods
have udev fail during boot
and become unable to mount the root filesystem.
So I am surprised that my dev box did not jump chest first
onto the pointy tipped sword of udev development.
Historically, failure to comply with udev developers had harsh consequences.
Therefore, better to read the udev change log and do as suggested.

To bluntly end the discussion /run/ might be a blunder.
It should probably be rejected by the LSB.
However, it's appearance is not a bug.
Instead it is capitulation with what udev software authors want.

Since /run/ grants no additional boons on Sorcerer
we do not have a stake in the outcome of the LSB's decision.
Sorcerer will probably do what udev software authors want.

However, this moment is of potential interest.
Requesting that the LSB rename /var/run/ to /run/
and /var/lock/ to /run/lock is tantamount to
requesting that the LSB rename /usr/ to /user/
When LSB makes a decision about it
please feel free to continue the thread
and post further information.

Since Sorcerer's SA email list is low volume
with an average of less than 1 email per day
this is not something of sufficient importance
to warrant our own private flame war.
I apologize for being overly verbose about the change.
