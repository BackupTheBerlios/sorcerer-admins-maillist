<PRE>Most experienced SAs already know that
process identification files can be problematic.
Daemons, such as gdm, do not go background,
do not separate from stdout and stderr,
and do not write PID files.
ntpd provides an incorrectly written PID file.
udev writes a PID file, but writes only one
number of it's many process IDs to the PID file.
The existence of a PID file does not guarantee
that that a daemon is running.
Nor are the numbers within guaranteed
to belong to the daemon's process.
There is much that can go wrong with PID files.

To PIDF or to not PIDF that was the question.
Fortunately, I can stop wishing for PID files
to work as good in reality as they do in theory.
cgroup's lasso provides a near perfect tool for
wrangling those ornery daemons into separate corrals.

Once a process is assigned to a cgroup
then all it's children will belong to the same cgroup.
Consequently, the tasks file for a cgroup
contains a complete list of PIDs.
Processes that terminate are
automatically removed from the tasks list.
Effectively, the tasks list becomes
a dynamically updating PID file
that has no possibility of being incorrect.
Is this not an awesome boon
beyond what can be expected
from meager static PID files?

However, two drawbacks exist.
First, no daemon uses cgroupping by default.
A daemon must be started with an init-script.
This is not a problem is it?
Secondly, a daemon has no concept
of what file system it runs upon
and neither does cgroup.
Whether a daemon runs on the &quot;keep&quot;
or on the &quot;real root file system&quot;
or on a &quot;chrooted root file system&quot;
can not be determined using cgroup,
because even the daemon would not know.
The only advantage a PID file has over cgroup
is that PID files are written to the file system
upon which the daemon is running.

I speculate that the only time when using a PID file
is preferable to using cgroup is
when the PID file is expected to be correct
and when we want to know exactly
what file system a daemon runs upon.
Consequently, PID files are not entirely useless.
I revised Sorcerer's init system
according to this new expectation.

init-scripts that fail to explicitly state
a PID file for use when starting a daemon
will track the daemon's PIDs with a cgroup tasks list.
Consequently, daemons such as gdm,
which used to be problematic to control with PID files,
can now be completely killed off by simultaneously
killing all the PIDs listed in gdm's cgroup's tasks list.

gdm and kdm-v4 init-scripts were updated.
Please complain about other init-scripts
that should also be adjusted
for using cgroup instead of PID files.
Otherwise I only intend to adjust init-scripts
after observing a problem with using PID files.

cgroup is not mentioned in LSB documentation.
Consequently, the LSB does not explicitly forbid
an init system from using cgroup tasks list
instead of or in addition to PID files.
So as usually we are pushing out the envelope
in order to gain a new magnitude of functionality.
Although Sorcerer's init-scripts
are not LSB compatible;
Sorcerer's init-system remains LSB compatible
for running LSB compatible init-scripts.
Therefore, we continue enjoying forward looking innovations
while not discarding backward compatibility.
