Probably the best criticism against deploying Sorcerer
is the amount of time required to deploy Sorcerer
when compared to a pre-compiled binary based distro.

&gt;<i>From my point of view there is no good compromise between
</I>Sorcerer and a pre-compiled binary based distro.
However, some of the deployment time can be reduced by
providing on the Install/Rescue CD
firefox, vlc, and a few other useful programs.
But if Sorcerer SAs seem against that idea
then I will not add those to the I/R.


&gt;<i> Just that is dont take away too much of SA's freedom to make a choices what
</I>&gt;<i> to install.
</I>&gt;<i> I am concerned that our current core software requirements are even now too
</I>&gt;<i> big and we are going towards system where Kyle says what we need.
</I>
:<i>)  Actually, it is not me who says what is needed.
</I>The software developers say what is needed.
However, I sometimes have a difficult time deciding
which requirements are optional.

With larger fixed disks these days in most cases
having some optionals as absolute requirements does not
detract from the appeal of a leaner installation.
One might even say that optionals is over-used in Sorcerer
and therefore the configuration of spells before casting
asks SAs too many questions.

&gt;<i> Basicly make more options what to compile and install. Like install just
</I>&gt;<i> bare core for eg. server purposes and if you are workstation user i dont
</I>&gt;<i> mind if theres option for GUI install, etc. But dont require all users to
</I>&gt;<i> install all bloated software, because some of us dont need it and dont use
</I>&gt;<i> it. So there cant be just one size fits all sort of installation because
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO i dont think its possible.
</I>
If Sorcerer comes as a full bush
then it can be pruned down to size easily.
But if it comes as a little seed
then it requires a bit of time to grow.
There is a difference between required for initial installation
and becoming permanently required.
The Sorcerer I/R comes with about 300 pre-installed software projects
or maybe closer to 270, and probably from that only about 200 spells
must absolutely remain installed on deployed boxes.

&gt;<i> I am always hated when Sorcerer requires X11 and about &quot;million&quot; spells to
</I>&gt;<i> compile, even though i never need them and even on binary distros there is
</I>&gt;<i> possibility to not to install X Window.
</I>
That can be discussed with the gobject-introspection software authors.
It was not my intention to make the installation of xorg libraries mandatory.
It happened to turn out that way.
Therefore, I went ahead and decided that a selection of xorg graphics drivers
and some other xorg related software would make a good addition.
But that was not the first thing I tried.
A long time ago I wrote a patch for gobject-introspection
so that console only boxes could be deployed.
But I did not want to constantly fight gobject-introspection authors about it.

For the most part I do not design the puzzle pieces.
I merely fit them together to create Sorcerer.
So what might look like my decision is usually just
me going with the flow of what the software authors are doing.
And sometimes software is added onto the Install/Rescue CD
because Jan or some other Sorcerer SA tells me that it is deployed
on their production boxes.
If it seems useful for rescue it might just go onto the Install/Rescue CD.

&gt;<i> In fact, mostly our server do run without X libraries and binaries
</I>&gt;<i> installed. Maybe in future when all root access requirements are not needed
</I>&gt;<i> its safe to install them even when you dont need it, well, it's just waste
</I>&gt;<i> of disk space still.
</I>
libX11 and a few header files installed is not a huge waste of space.


&gt;<i> Regarding live cd, of course its good to it have a GUI on it but if you are
</I>&gt;<i> installing using it, dont count that we want that GUI to install as a
</I>&gt;<i> mandatory option, leave options to what to install.
</I>
A live CD would not be required for an X11 + GUI installation method.
But there were other reasons why I did not want to install that way.
Sorcerer SAs are expected to be able to use a command line
and to use the sorcery, cast, dispel, and augur tools.
An installation that is too fluffy to being with misrepresents
the fact that getting the most out of a Sorcerer box
requires some ability with using a command line shell.

Okay, unless anyone objects
then I will try to make the next set of Install/Rescue CDs more minimalistic
to include prying off xorg libraries.

Looks like the compromise is going towards tiny rather than convenient.
