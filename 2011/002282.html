<PRE>When the  tomoyo domain called &quot;user&quot; becomes available
then please reboot the boxes after updating.
I further specialized accesses so that services
not providing user login can run in the limited domain
while services for user login will run in the user domain.
The benefit limits execution of code within the limited domain
to software that is already installed on the computer.
Therefore, even if an IRC or attack relay kit
was downloaded to /tmp/
then execution of the alien code on /tmp/
will not be permitted while in the &quot;limited&quot; domain.

My initial plans for tomoyo implementation favored trifurcation
even before I envisioned a specific domain for sorcery.
Users want more freedom than is necessary for most services.
However, that also makes the &quot;user&quot; domain slightly less secure.
However, a separate &quot;limited&quot; domain locks services in an inescapable box.

I am considering running web servers in the &quot;limited&quot; domain.
Please be aware that that services running in the &quot;limited&quot; domain
will have read access, but not write access to /home/
That might effect some CGI, especially the CGI that I tend to write.
Therefore, some place in var besides
/var/cache/{archive,ccache,sources}/
/var/log/
could be a good location for transferring data
that might otherwise be recorded in a home directory.

/var/log/ is still something of an undecided territory.
Obviously, having some services log is a good idea.
However, allowing the &quot;limited&quot; domain with unlimited
write access to /var/log/ enables an attacker
to cover their tracks.
Therefore, do not expect to be able to write to /var/log/
while in the &quot;limited&quot; domain until I make specific exceptions
for log files that are safe to modify such as Xorg log files
and log files produced by gdm and kdm.
