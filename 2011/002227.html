Yes.  Actually, I have a speed program.

On a Pentium M 1300 MHz

# ./loop
39931
# unset LANG
# ./loop
55714

On a 3000 MHz AMD Phenom

# ./loop
135957
# unset LANG
# ./loop
193917

Internationalization costs more performance than optimization.
And the speed at which BASH can run something like
cast can not easily be measured.
-O3 optimization on BASH may be insignificant compared
to other things that can be adjusted in order to increase
the performance of a BASH script.
However, BASH compiled with -O3 seems to run fine.

&gt;<i> -O3 on ffmpeg and MesaLib is OK, as the software authors actually
</I>&gt;<i> specify it, and video work has a lot of loops in that benefit from
</I>&gt;<i> unrolling, etc.
</I>
My BASH speed program does little more than
increase a counter and run loops.
However, the execution of a loop in BASH
is probably coded significantly different
than a loop in C.

gcc's loop unrolling is fine for loops of finite known iteration.
Unrolling only eliminates one &quot;loop&quot; instruction per loop.
And the &quot;loop&quot; instruction decreases CX and does
a conditional jump if CX is not 0.
That optimization can be specified without -O3.
And who is to say if a 500 or 1000 iteration
loop is best unrolled?
In lining functions is possible for C authors.
Maybe they also should unroll loops in C code
or have a method to tell the gcc compiler specifically
which loops to unroll?

&gt;<i> Between -O2 and -O1, though, there is a marked difference. You could
</I>&gt;<i> try it for yourself and see. -O1 is both less tested and horribly
</I>&gt;<i> slower than -O2, there is no reason to use that. I have used -O1 and
</I>&gt;<i> -O0 before as a system default, and can tell you from experience that
</I>&gt;<i> you won't like it.
</I>
123092 bash with -O0
176831 bash with -O1
190776 bash with -O2
196087 bash with -O3

Achieving consistent numbers is difficult for this test.
However, we can see that while -O3 is faster than -O2
the difference is insignificant.
-O0 is about 70% as fast as -O1
-O1 is about 90% as fast as -O2
-O2 is about 97% as fast as -O3

And the difference is only perceived
on something that can run a core
at full bore for seconds at a time.
And it is difficult to measure since the kernel
might allocate more or less CPU cycles
to the process per test run.

Unfortunately, this is not
the definitive answer about gcc optimization.
It is merely the output of a speed testing script that I rarely use.
But if were were to make judgements based upon this,
unless someone has something better to provide,
then -O0 is 64% as fast as -O2
And that speed difference only matters
for a process trying to at 100% of a CPU core
for several seconds.


&gt;<i> I do believe our distribution default should be: mtune=native -O2 -pipe
</I>
real    0m32.370s compile time for -O0
real    0m39.466s compile time for -O1
real    0m44.998s compile time for -O2
real    0m50.160s compile time for -O3

But compilation time increases.
Compile time of bash with -O0 is 71% the time of -O2

Comparing -O1 to -O2
Performance 90%, Compile time 87%
-O1 to -O2 10% performance increase
and 13% compilation increase.
For software that is not CPU intensive
then a 30% overall reduction in compilation time
for 36% reduction in runtime performance seems favorable.
-O0 is not a bad choice for most software compilation.


&gt;<i> I run march=native -O2 -pipe for everything that does not have CFLAGS
</I>&gt;<i> specified, but this is non-portable.
</I>
It is nearly the same as was Sorcerer default optimizations.


&gt;<i> And yes, there are spells that require special flags. That's why we
</I>&gt;<i> have the CFLAG variable in spells. So, just ripping out all the -O3 in
</I>&gt;<i> the grimoire is also not advisable.
</I>
Replacing the -O3 with -O2
will cost approximately 3% runtime performance
but gain approximately 10% compilation speed.
BASH is not the ideal example,
because not everything it does during
configure and make is compilation.


&gt;<i> My original point still stands: We should not be using -O3 unless the
</I>&gt;<i> software author specifies it as both making a difference and is
</I>&gt;<i> tested.
</I>
Speed testing is difficult.
I am not certain to what extent
I trust the results I gained while
attempting to speed test BASH.
However, the results seem congruent
with SAs common sense about gcc optimization,
which is -O3 requires longer to compile
and might gain about 0% to 5% performance increase.


&gt;<i> As a way forward, may I suggest we leave the grimoire as is? There are
</I>&gt;<i> not that many spells specifying -O3, so it's still easy to monitor.
</I>
If everyone will feel more at east without -O3
then I do not mind eliminating it.
The performance loss may be anything from nothing to 5%
depending upon what is running.
And yet an increase in compilation speed is definite.


&gt;<i> Anyone running into any instability might want to go see the flags the
</I>&gt;<i> spell is compiled with, and if it's -O3, try with -O2 and see if the
</I>&gt;<i> instability goes away.
</I>
Instead if -O3 compilation is prohibited
then I can be certain that no instability is being
caused by -O3 compilation.
Therefore, I will not receive, investigate,
nor respond to bug reports concerning -O3.
SAs that want -O3 style optimization can specify
the individual gcc parameters in a cpref file.
The -O3 debate is not merely a question
of runtime performance and compilation time.
It's a question of runtime performance,
compilation time, and kyle time.
Prohibiting -O3 also keeps SAs from
re-compiling their entire box -O3
which might produce something undesirable.


&gt;<i> If it does, report that back to the Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> lists, and we'll take it out of the grimoire on a case by case basis.
</I>
I was doing the -O3 on some spells for the benefit of the SAs.
But this presents an excellent excuse for me
to revise the grimoire to -O2 for CPU intensive software
and set the Sorcerer defaults to -O0
If SAs are actually wasting time waiting for software to compile
then -O0 is clearly more favorable than -O2.

-O0 optimization creates software that runs 30% to 40% slower
But a default of -O0 optimization does not necessarily
create a box that runs even 3% slower.
That is because glibc is compiled with -O2.
And other CPU intensive programs are compiled with -O2.
Just as spoilers are a wasted expense
on cars that run less 80 KPH
so is the use of -O2 a waste on software
that lacks potential to run full bore
for more than a second.

Optimization of linux and glibc is most important
because those layers are closest to the base.
Almost every program links with glibc
and uses functions from glibc.
Likewise glibc uses linux functions.
So optimization spent there benefits a great many programs.

Optimization on penguin-command,
which is a missile command style game,
might make it run with a somewhat lower CPU usage.
But that makes no difference while still using less than 100%.

Just played some penguin command.
Here is a line of it as output from the &quot;top&quot; command.

  PID USER     %CPU P %MEM  VIRT  RES  SHR    TIME+  COMMAND
12646 kyle        5 1  0.5  123m  19m 5452   0:04.63 penguin-command

penguin-command averaged a 4% to 5% CPU usage when compiled with -O0
And I realize the cycles are mostly used
for playing the Amiga mod music files.
Consequently, optimization of SDL_mixer
would provide more benefit than optimization
of penguin-command.
That is because penguin-command links with SDL_mixer
in order to play the amiga mod file.
Therefore, most of that 5% CPU cycles are being used
by SDL_mixer and not penguin-command.
However, top can not show that.

Even a video player might not suffer a performance deficit
when compiled with -O0, because the audio/video codecs
which are using the majority of CPU cycles might come from
ffmpeg which is optimized with -O2.

Likewise all of KDE, except kde-workspace,
can be compiled with optimization of -O0
and that will not create a performance deficit.
When KDE is running nearly the only KDE owned
process that is consistently using CPU cylces is kwin.
And kwin is installed by kde-workspace.

In general heavy optimization is most beneficial on CPU intensive software,
and often more so on CPU intensive software libraries than on programs.

Software that runs for merely an instant and then exits
gains more benefit from link optimization or static linking.
The cost for starting a process is significant.
For many programs the start speed
is more significant than execution speed.
Therefore, a program like ccache
runs optimally when statically linked.
Many programs that are frequently invoked
would benefit from static linking.
Static linking provides 3 times or faster program start times.
And program execution speed insignificantly increases.
However, static programs are larger on disk,
use more memory, are not i18n translated,
and do not immediately benefit
when the libraries they require are updated.

Because static linked executable files
do not receive immediate security benefits of library updates
there are very few statically linked programs installed on Sorcerer.
However, there are some.
sed and coreutils spells have switches to enable static linking
for some of the programs that are frequently used.
sed is notoriously abused by libtool.
And sorcery frequently uses &quot;cut&quot; &quot;sort&quot; and &quot;uniq&quot;
However, those processes load and run only for a mere instant.

I consider such things.
A long time ago I made changes to sorcery
to test it's execution speed using busybox provided utilities.
I somewhere have a port of Sorcerer to uClibc instead of glibc.
I try many absurd things to make Sorcerer faster.
Trusting my judgement is not a bad idea
for anyone that is doing less testing than I am.

However, now that the question of optimization
has once again been put to discussion
I am in favor of less optimization rather than more optimization.
I have observed that while CPU speed has increased
that compilation time has also increased and not remained the same.
More simply put compilation speed
is a more important factor today
than it was a decade ago.
I expect that a change of defaults to -O0
can yield approximately a 25% decrease
in software cast time while yielding almost
no impact on overall computer performance,
because the most significant software will
receive -O2 optimization.

With this change SAs that really want -O2 can
step up to -O2 by using a default cpref.
Otherwise cpref frequently has no use for SAs
that are not authoring software
nor testing software with debug information included.
