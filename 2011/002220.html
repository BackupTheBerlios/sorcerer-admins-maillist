# augur log install $SPELL

&gt;<i> also there was command which showed what version of &lt;spell&gt; you did have

</I>
# augur log version $SPELL


&quot;# augur help log

Provide specified log for spell

Examples:

# augur  log  compile   atk
# augur  log  download  bash
# augur  log  elf       curl
# augur  log  estimate  gawk
# augur  log  event     gedit
# augur  log  install   gtk+
# augur  log  md5sum    firefox
# augur  log  version   ncurses&quot;


# augur log event

is one of the newer additions to the &quot;log&quot; command.
It provides the content of the most recent event log for a spell.
Therefore,

# augur log event firefox

will give the reason for why firefox autofailed if firefox autofailed.


&gt;<i> I used those often but now their seemed to be missing, how they are
</I>&gt;<i> implemented today?
</I>
# augur | grep -vx '' | wc -l
86

86 lines provide information concerning

# find /usr/libexec/sorcery/augur.d/ -type f | wc -l
62

62 augur commands.
However, almost all augur commands have
verbose help available by typing

# augur help $COMMAND


&gt;<i> BTW: Kyle, maybe you should do some sort of man -pages for sorcery tools?
</I>
I do not create a manual pages, and web pages for augur commands
because then when I change/improve a command
then I must edit documentation in 3 places instead of just 1 place.

The reason for concatenation of similar commands into sub-commands
such as &quot;augur compile&quot; into &quot;augur log compile&quot;
was to both make the method of execution of similar commands more consistent
and also to improve the readability of augur's main help screen.

# augur | grep log
log        type spell            selected log type for spell

that probably says too little about what it does.
But I have a difficult time squeezing the 8 sub commands into that space.

Perhaps a compromise I can create an

# augur tutorial

command?
And it can provide a multi-page tutorial that with examples
of the usage of the most command and frequently used augur commands?

I rather not create a manual page for augur
unless it can be created using a script.
That way it can auto run when I roll the sorcery tarball.

I copied the above into my todo list.
It is something I want to allocate time to consider.

&gt;<i> I am kinda lost when i look todays sorcery tools, they are changed so much if
</I>&gt;<i> you compare them what they were year or too ago.
</I>
I agree.
It is more confusing that intuitive.
The compromise that gained improved maintainability
also cost a significant amount of simplicity
by concealing the familiar log viewing commands
as sub-commands under the &quot;log&quot; command.

There are 58 augur commands
that include nearly the entire functionality
of all the augur commands of 2 years ago
and also the newer functionality.

Newer augur commands exist such as:
a; freezer; info; monolib; undispel; queue; uproot.
Consequently, the older commands were
collected into similar groups and compacted.
If left flat out then augur would have more than 100 commands.
And choice of word overlap would be more difficult
for dissimilar augur commands.
Previously there existed
# augur install $SPELL
and
# augur installed $SPELL
The first gave the log file
and the second indicated if the spell is installed.
It is a little bit confusing.
Now there is
# augur log install $SPELL
and
# augur installed $SPELL
That newer is a bit more explicit.

However, I feel tempted to remove
# augur installed $SPELL
however
# augur installed
is useful for displaying a list of installed spells.
Yet more frequently I type
# augur snapshot | grep $SOMETHING

I agree that the help for augur is inadequate.
Someone new to Sorcerer must dive
into each command with
# augur help
in order to gain sufficient understanding.
However, I want a solution that
which I can implement without
requiring constant repeated effort.
So perhaps I will write a script
to capture the output of each
# augur help $COMMAND
into a manual page?
First, I must learn the format for a manual page
because it is not something that
I already know such as HTML.
Manual pages in HTML might be an improvement,
but I can not yet judge without knowing the merits
of groff and troff.

Ah, here it is
# man roff

Ah, so this is why someone would want to use Emacs?
Unfortunately, the manual page does not contain information
about how to make manual pages.
I wonder what is the canonical method for creating manual pages?
Perhaps I can learn faster by dissecting a manual page in nano?
Looks as if it might require more than a half hour to accomplish.
Perhaps I can allocate the time after the next I/R release.
