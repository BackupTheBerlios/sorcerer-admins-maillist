<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>The valentine's day, February 14, release of sorcery has a tiny bug.
So some spells will fail stating that the compiler can not create
executable files.
But then recasting the spell works.
Please update any of those installed sorcery to version event-20110215-0
That has the bug fix.
I apologize that I did not notice that bug soon enough while testing.

augur modules have changed slightly.
Some of the old methods are deprecated.
Some new methods are introduced.
Please review the augur help screen
in order to decide if any scripts require updating.
Deprecated methods do not display on augur's help screen.
However, they will remain functional for 6 months.
After that they will be removed.

These revision to sorcery are intended to factorize common code
making sorcery and grimoire more flexible.
The revision of methods for information acquisition from augur
is also intended to make the appearance of augur's help
to have a tighter focus on commands of a similar nature.

For example, commands involving requirements used to have names such as:

aarof
arof
aron
iron
elfof
elfon
static

and so forth.

Therefore, they were scattered up and down augur's helps screen.
Yet now they appear as:

req        aarof           *      spells that these spells can require
req        arof            *      spells that these spells do  require
req        arofni          *      uninstalled requirements for spells
req        aron            *      spells that require these spells
req        elfof           *      spells that these spells require by ELF libs
req        elfon           *      spells that require these spells by ELF libs
req        iron            *      installed spells that require these spells
req        lclof           *      identify required spells from compile log
req        static          *      spells that statically link with these spells


Yet now they are conveniently grouped together.
And all of the &quot;req&quot; based commands expect
that spell names should be given on stdin
just as the actual functions in sorcery require.

Therefore, what used to be invoked as:
# augur arof bash
can now be invoked as:
# echo bash | augur arof

As Sorcerer SAs we are all familiar with the convenience of piping
stdout of one command to the stdin of another command.
So a change such as this should not cause inconvenience.

And back by popular demand is:

avail        latest        *        latest version for spells
avail        legacy        *        legacy version for spells
avail        secure        *        secure version for spells
avail        stable        *        stable version for spells
avail      unstable        *      unstable version for spells

Likewise it only accepts input of spell names on stdin.

Example:

# echo -e &quot;gedit\nwarzone2100&quot; | augur avail unstable
gedit   2.91.6
warzone2100     3.0_beta4


Remember if an augur method is invoked from the tty
and it is waiting for input
then the SA can type what they want and press ctrl-d to end input.

# augur avail unstable
gedit
gedit   2.91.6

In the above example I invoked
# augur avail unstable
and then I typed:

gedit

It immediately responded with the information.
Then I pressed ctrl-d and returned to command line.

Pressing ctrl-c while running any sorcery script
will cause the merged grimoire and index to be
removed before exit.

Using ctrl-d instead of or before trying ctrl-c avoids causing problems.

Last but not least, the augur commands also have verbose help.
If the &quot;req&quot; command module seems confusing then type:

# augur help req

Hopefully the help screen for &quot;req&quot; and provided examples
will demystify the confusing parts.
