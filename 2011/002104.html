<PRE>I agree that rebooting should not be a problem.
/etc/lilo.conf is a symbolic link to /etc/lilo/conf
And /etc/lilo/conf is a file that is automatically reconstructed as required
from the contents of /etc/lilo/{head,tail} and /boot/*/linux
Then following reconstruction lilo is reinstalled to the boot block
that is specified in /etc/lilo/head
It should not be problematic.

If /etc/lilo/head without the password= line is sent my way
then perhaps I might be able to spot something about it which seems problematic.

As for kernel and module removal...
This is not done by sorcery.
Instead it is done by /etc/init.d/lilo
The last 4 installed kernels are kept.
The most recently installed kernel becomes the default
kernel unless a default is specified in /etc/lilo/head
Specifying a default in /etc/lilo/head can become problematic
eventually when that kernel is removed.

Kernel updates are not too frequent.
In most situations removal of the currently booted kernel, initramfs,
and modules
is not problematic because the box will have been up for a long time
and any kernel
module that would be required would have already been loaded.
Obviously, this might not always be the situation.
However, keeping more than 4 kernels begins a problematic situation for
SAs that have /boot/ on a separate 2G file system,
which is recommended for boxes that boot using LUKS encryption
or use a file system for / that is not lilo compatible.

So obviously, keeping an indefinite amount of legacy kernels and
modules is not a solution.
And lilo can store information for no more than approximately 16 labels.
Therefore, the best solution is probably to fix the box
so that it can reboot after a kernel update.

It is not something to become upset about.
15 years ago SAs were having lilo configuration and booting problems
and even today it is possible to do so especially when the SA becomes
confused about what lilo installed where runs first.

My recommendation is to have lilo install to the boot block of the
/boot/ partition
and use ms-sys to install a bootable master boot record to the primary
fixed disk.
That way when the box boots it first runs ms-sys
then ms-sys loads and runs the boot block of the first partition with
the bootable flag.
That should cause lilo to run.
And lilo should load the initramfs and kernel image.
Following that the kernel runs, mounts the initramfs on / and executes /init
That is a tiny summary of what happens after the power on self test.

The fdisk program can be used to toggle the bootable flag on a partition.
Even if forgotten, the Sorcerer menu driven installer usually turns on
the bootable flag for the /boot partition.
So it should not be a problem.

Some SAs want lilo installed in the MBR of a fixed disk.
That is fine also.
In the past I might have had reasons for not wanting that,
but I can not remember any of the reasons now.
Intentionally configuring lilo to install in the MBR solves the problem
of what lilo runs first by potentially overwriting a stale lilo
installed to the MBR.
If a stale lilo is installed to the MBR and Sorcerer installs lilo
fresh to the boot block of /boot or /
then that would become a definite reason why the box would not boot.

Hopefully, the box can be put into a state bootable from fixed disk.
I only knew one SA that had a problem doing that more than a decade ago.
*lol*
He installed lilo to a floppy.
So the linux operating system installed on the fix disk
started it's initial booting from a floppy with lilo in the MBR.
But perhaps to us it was not the strangest solution since
we both started computing in the pre 80386 era
before computers came with fixed disks installed.
So we both had lots of experience with booting from floppy.

However, there probably is not a modern computer which
can not boot from fixed disk unless it has bad bugs in the BIOS.
If so then it can usually be repaired by a flash upgrade of the
motherboard BIOS to a newer version.
It might be worth a check to see if a newer version exists.
Good luck fixing the box.
