<PRE>Fantastic.
I have no dual booters nor M$ operating systems.
I am pleased that someone discovered and reported the problem.

But it seems that it would be more of a problem
with the M$ W7 MBR code
rather than an issue with  syslinux or extlinux.

The next question on my mind is...
What MBR allows for dual booting of both?
Is the syslinux MBR an adequate solution?
Can the linux's /boot or / partition be marked as bootable
and then have extlinux chain load the M$ operating system
from it's partition?
Or does one chainload from the M$ bootloader to linux
and that was not recognizing the extlinux as bootable?

My opinion is that bootloaders than can run from
the boot block of a partition are more flexible than
a bootloader that must be installed into the MBR.
Consequently, I would expect that extlinux and lilo
would be more dual boot friendly than grub.

While on the subject of running non ELF executable files,
wine for running win32 applications runs on Sorcerer x86_64 multilib.
Yet I suppose by now there may be more than a few win64 applications?
I have no experience setting up a wine for running both
win32 and win64 apps, yet compilation of wine appears to support
an experimental mode for use with win64 apps.
Is anyone interested in that or can set it up and test it?

Might not be a perfect way to enjoy both concurrently?
wine works for running some, but not all win32 apps.
Dual booting limits to running only either win or linux apps.
And virtual computers will lack hardware accelerated OpenGL.
Any suggestions?
