<PRE>Unfortunately, /sbin/init does not support launching
a getty during sysinit directly from the initttab.
Fortunately, another equally effect method was obvious.
Therefore, the getty on virtual console #7
is now also available during sysinit.

There is no immediate use for logging in during sysinit.
However, if sysinit hangs
then being able to login
is far more satisfying than pressing the reset button
and rebooting with kernel parameter rdinit=/bin/bash
In the unlikely event of a hang during sysinit
then the SA might enjoy the convenience of being able to log in,
and to check the output from ps, lsof, dmesg, and other utilities.
Perhaps if the problem is spotted
then merely issuing a kill command
may be sufficient for allowing the boot to continue.

Therefore, after the modifications to /etc/inittab
that were suggested in the previous email
along with the next updates of init-scripts
then boxes will be able to offer login
to the keep on virtual console #7
at all times.
During sysinit, runlevels, shutdown, reboot, and snack time
that getty on virtual console #7 will remain available
for allowing the SA to login and receive
a root bash prompt on the &quot;keep.&quot;

Although this change does not directly improve robustness of Sorcerer init
I am pleased because it allows the unprecedented ability
to login at all times after linux and the initramfs are properly loaded.
