<PRE>&gt;<i> That might sound silly, but I still do not understand why someone would
</I>&gt;<i> want a swap file, instead of a swap partition.
</I>
Swap files have good uses.
First, they can be created when required
to provide additional swap that is beyond
the normal amount of swap that a box runs with.
Secondly, they can be removed to provide additional space.
Third, instead of using an encrypted swap partition
a SA could have swap files on an encrypted partition.
Swap makes for an interesting read.
Therefore boxes that have encrypted file systems
should also have encrypted swaps.

When I built a box with 4G of RAM on it,
I was uncertain about whether I wanted dedicated swap partitions.
Thinking in a limited way I decided to omit swap partitions.
However, I discovered that I might often
cast software concurrently in different roots,
run several virtual machines concurrently,
and/or do other things that consume RAM.
Consequently, I usually run with 2G of swap.
And most of the time a 2G swap is 90% overkill.

However, a swap file is not always a less preferable idea.
When the swap is rarely used
then the performance drain for a swap file
barely differs from a swap partition.

Traditionally, and especially so on boxes without tmpfs,
a swap should be created that is large enough to hold
nearly all the memory consumed by all the processes
that continue running during and after boot.
That way nearly all available memory
can be granted to a single user process.
That can be useful when doing compression with
very large block values which is possible with xz.

However, since we gained the Sorcerer's keep,
boxes now have an additional 100M of swappable memory.
Although the complimentary 256M swap file that is
created during installation can be deleted
it is not a bad size for a minimal swap.
In general linux will tend to swap from RAM
bytes that probably will not be required again.
But there is no guarantee.
Therefore, a minimal swap that is about twice
the size of an actual minimal swap helps
avoid having a minimal swap experience
significant shuffling and fragmentation.

I advise 1G of RAM per core.
However, when not compiling large sources on tmpfs
then the extra RAM might soak
what would normally be displaced to swap
on boxes with less RAM.
Consequently, if a box has a large loadout of RAM
and a reasonably dedicated role
then the SA might choose to allocate
a minimum amount of space to a swap file
rather than dedicate gigabytes of disk space to a swap partition.
However, laptops designed for suspend to disk require
a somewhat large unencrypted swap partition.
Jan Merka knows more.

So in summary a power-monging box with plenty of RAM
has no requirement for swap.
However, when a box is used as a workstation by an aggressive SA
who has no concern for loadavg
then that SA might add additional swap files when
memory consumption is expected to peak.

Fortunately, there is now a faster way to create a swap file

# fallocate -l1g /swap.1g
# mkswap         /swap.1g
# chmod   0      /swap.1g

The fallocate is like a ftruncate except that
it pre-allocates blocks to a file
instead of making the file sparse.
Consequently, it is faster than dd from /dev/zero because
the blocks are allocated, but requires no significant disk I/O.

I have some plans for making Sorcerer a bit more swap file friendly.
I want to create swap files in /swap/ as I do on my boxes.
And I want to introduce a shell script that can be run
to automatically create and add a swap file.
If I can hook it onto the OOM killer
then perhaps boxes can prevent grinding to a halt
by creating more swap rather than semi-randomly killing processes.


&gt;<i> Okay, moving on. From what it sounds like (and I'll create a new VM in
</I>&gt;<i> vmware &#160;to see it for myself in a few minutes here), the requirement now
</I>&gt;<i> is that an SA *must* create a /boot of *at least* 2GB &quot;if&quot; he chooses
</I>&gt;<i> something like xfs, which needs one - perfect!
</I>
I have not rolled the I/R yet,
but essentially the next sinstall will fight SAs
that are trying to create a boot that is less than 2G.


&gt;<i> Anything more isn't 'novice', IMO, but rather, n00b, and deserves to be
</I>&gt;<i> below in your proposed *Automatic* mode ;)
</I>
I agree, but that did not stop me from dreaming about it.
I probably would not go as far as to call it noob mode,
because some people might take offense.
But there is no shame in it because we all enjoyed
the splendid experience of being noob at some time or another.

The first few years that I started into computing
almost nobody owned a personal computer,
unless it was an Atari 2600,
which was merely a television game console.
Normal people did not know what to do with a computer,
and did not know how to operate nor program computers.
Consequently, I knew nobody who I could ask for assistance
and nobody that I could ask for help.
Programming skill was rare even among
the few people that frequented BBSes in those days.
There was no Internet, no email,
and 640K was a huge amount of RAM!
So in contrast to my experience
of being noob with 64K RAM computers
being a noob these days is awesome!

Children of this new era are not born
with a silver spoon in their mouth,
but instead a cordless mouse in the hand.  :)
But they still require training.
Computer skills should be as basic as literacy.
I knew that eventually computer skills would become
as commonly known as the skill to utilize a pencil.
Yet for the moment many people only have sufficient
skill to use a mouse, keyboard, and webrowser,
and they can just barely do web based email.

Even if Sorcerer can be made to install for such people
they will be unable to fix unexpected problems.
The only way to fix those boxes would be
to have a competent SA do a remove ssh login
and do proper trouble shooting technique.
Consequently, I feel uncertain about the viability
of Sorcerer for a growing population of gadget gurus.
These gadget gurus expect everything electronic
to work as simple as a light switch
and they have no hope of fixing anything
that goes wrong in any of their gadgets.

So the question has never been whether or not
I am able to create a totally automatic installation for Sorcerer.
Introducing the modular linux kernel to Sorcerer
was the final piece of that puzzle.
The question is, can I live with the consequences of making
Sorcerer installable by non SAs?
Is it not the purchase of massive disappointment
on a lay-away plan for non SAs?

&gt;&gt;<i> The novice mode could be made to query an installation device from the SA
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and automatically create a 2G ext2 /boot partition, 4G swap, and to put
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the rest on an ext4 / or is that too harsh?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To reiterate and clarify, too harse, IMO :)
</I>
Yes, I agree that is too harsh for novice mode.
The menu driven installer should have 3 modes.
Automatic, Novice, and Expert.
And the the SA should be made to choose the mode
when the installer starts instead of merely receiving
a menu entry for changing mode.


&gt;<i> I'll never use an *automatic* mode, but yes, I think that's a good idea...
</I>
Automatic installation adds another 12 feet of rope
for that extra long fall from grace.
*lol*


&gt;<i> Okay this isn't something that most of us will use, yet I think perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> it's not a bad idea so people coming to the distro can just say, install
</I>&gt;<i> on /dev/sda and off it goes. Yes. for &quot;Automatic&quot; - something I would
</I>&gt;<i> never use.
</I>
After solving all the bugs on an I/R and doing a final roll of it
then I will probably lazily use the automatic install for the final test.
Even after solving all bugs I still do one final installation and reboot
test of each I/R prior to it being distributed from the web server.
That way I do not merely expect that it works.
I know that it works.


&gt;<i> I believe it will make it more palatable for some to adopt Sorcerer.
</I>&gt;<i> They just want to see a box light up. Then, hopefully, they fdisk and do
</I>&gt;<i> it right later once they know it's bitchen.
</I>
The automatic installation provides
an example that the SA might learn from.
Unfortunately, people who do not know
about manual pages do not read manual pages.
People who do not know
about fdisk do not read/edit partition tables.
Ultimately, an automatic installation
could grant a Sorcerer box
to people who do not merit the reward
by reason of skill nor tenacity.
Therefore, I conjecture that there
will become more dissatisfied SAs.
And that is why I have not implemented an automatic installation.
But at least providing an automatic installation
would cease the flow of emails that read,
&quot;Sorcerer is too difficult to install.&quot;

What is it about this generation that expects everything to be easy
without any training, without any skill, without any practice?
Why do they want to play guitar hero type video games
instead of learning how to play an actual musical instrument?
Why do they cheat on their academic exams?
I hesitate at the thought of creating a Sorcerer
for gadget gurus that expect that hard work
is removing a gadget from it's original packaging
and that trouble shooting
is remembering to recharge the batteries.

Do I seem a little bit more than irritated about it?
That is because I am.
But I suppose if helping the total noobs turns into a disaster
then I can always rip out the code.
The novice install is not bad as simple exam
to determine who becomes a Sorcerer SA.
Sorcerer is not an elite, nor prestigious, nor an expensive
organization to join.
But not every 2 finger typist
deserves an engraved invitation card.
Being a SA should require a little bit more than
than knowing how to press the power button
and knowing how to insert a CDROM disk.


&gt;<i> for example, back in the 386 days, it was enough to create a /boot of
</I>&gt;<i> 8MBytes &#160;on a Maxtor 514MByte drive that had more than 1024 Cylinders ;)
</I>
Yes, I fondly remember my first 500M disk.
The size was beyond huge!
But I also had the experience of using 10M fixed-disks
and those chirped like birds.
The 10M to 80M fixed-disks seemed more like
an expensive convenience instead of a mass-storage device.
But 500M seemed sufficiently massive!

I nearly fail to comprehend how the space of 4
500M fixed disk is now required for an adequate /boot
But that is how times have changed.
A super-awesome machine is no longer a
80286 with 640K of RAM with 10M fixed-disks and EGA graphics.
But that was far better than 384K RAM 8088 with 1 floppy disk and CGA graphics.

Does not considering the near exponential growth
of computer resources in the past
give cause to wonder how many years a 2G /boot
will remain sufficient?
In retrospect we might yet discover that 2G was too small.


&gt;<i> That's a judgement call on your part Kyle. I'll never use an automatic.
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, I looked at an automatic install once in the Redhat 4 or 5
</I>&gt;<i> days, just to see - it was ugly, but perhaps necessary for the sake of
</I>&gt;<i> adoption. As I recall, it would build a system that wasn't even usable
</I>&gt;<i> for longer than a month or so.
</I>
I can see how that experience would create a prejudice.
However, the Sorcerer automatic install would not be doomed to failure.
I could provide an automatic installation that would be decent
for use as a KDE workstation.
Overall, I expect that the goal can be narrowed to that end,
because non SAs would not be expected
to deploy an Apache HTTPD web server, for example.

However, a SA could hand a Sorcerer I/R CD
to a user and tell him to go install it on a new box
by using the automatic install option.
Not all users would be pleased
to be required to do something that resembled IT labor.
But the ability to delegate that task would not be without an advantage.
First, if the SA did the install then the user would
be somewhere else wasting time and learning nothing.
Secondly, if the SA can delegate the task of installation
then the SA can still enjoy the benefits of being admin
of a Sorcerer box without having personally endured
the lengthy installation.  :)

Consequently, when we realize that the professional SA
often has more to do than can be done
then the potential for delegating the duty of an automatic installation
to noob might give that SA minutes or even hours
to race ahead of the avalanche of work that threatens to bury them.

Given that consideration we realize that the automatic installation
is not to omit the necessity of a competent SA.
Also it is not an option that a competent SA
would want to use unless deploying a low security workstation.
Yet an automatic installation grants the SA
the option to delegate the task to unskilled people.
And I have yet to work in an office
that had a shortage of unskilled labor.

Consequently, I can not make an expectation that
an automatic installation would go completely unused.
Rather I expect that it might be occasionally mis-used
by someone who expects that Sorcerer has a niche for noobs.
However, one perplexing thought defies expectation.
If Sorcerer takes on the characteristics of a noob friendly distro
then how will noobs hone their skill?
I suppose as usual the answer remains the same.
It is up to each SA to find their own way to hone skills.


&gt;<i> And I was also totally freaked out around the RH 6 time, when I first
</I>&gt;<i> saw that disk druid thingy. Gawd I hate it when a company insists that
</I>&gt;<i> we use those distros.
</I>
Ah, I am clueless..
<A HREF="http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/3/html/Installation_Guide_x8664/s1-diskpartitioning.html">http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/3/html/Installation_Guide_x8664/s1-diskpartitioning.html</A>

Ah, I see.
It looks somewhat like Sorcerer's fstab menu,
except that in Sorcerer partitioning is done in a separate
step using a separate program.

I can allow SAs to do partitioning or to do partitioning for them.
Either way is just as easy.
My reason for allowing the SA to access partition programs such
as a fdisk, cfdisk, parted is because those are the partitioning programs
that a SA would use if doing a manual installation.
My intention behind the menu driven installer
was not to give the SA an alternate method for accomplishing
the tasks for installation, but rather to help illuminate and guide
the SA to those programs traditionally used during installation.
But maybe the compromise has shifted towards automation
rather than a firm shove in the proper direction.

If Redhat calls their fancy menu drive program &quot;Disk Druid&quot;
then should Sorcerer's fstab menu be called the &quot;Fstab Fairy?&quot;
*lol*
Actually, I am surprised they did not call their utility rhdd.
I am glad to see an end to pointless acronyms.
The continuation of such practice would suggest that we
never stopped using 8.3 file systems.


&gt;<i> Although I would really like to try a Sorcerer workstation out and see
</I>&gt;<i> how all that comes together, it didn't happen for me starting with the
</I>&gt;<i> I/R's I was using as late as six or eight months ago.
</I>
Sometimes the KDE compilation breaks.
Evert most frequently spots and reports those problems.
Doing software upgrades as they occur can lead to unexpected problems.
Evert discovered that kdepim-runtime-v4 version 4.6.3 requires
shared-desktop-ontologies version 0.5
and that later versions will cause kdepim-runtime-v4 to not compile.
That was the most recent problem discovered concerning KDE.
Probably KDE-v4 compilation works.
But if not, please report the problem in order to receive a fix.


&gt;<i> But having come from Jolix, SLS, Slack, Yggdrasil, etc., I just don't
</I>&gt;<i> see any other way to manipulate a disk other than fdisk - I don't even
</I>&gt;<i> like the cfdisk front end, or care much for that grub stuff either LOL.
</I>
I always use fdisk.
If a distribution install method
does not allow an opportunity to learn how to use
one of the standard disk partitioning programs
then the installer is doing a disservice to the SA.

Of course some distros seem to prefer if SAs only learn
their distribution specific tools and therefore become
incapable of transitioning to a distro that uses
traditional command line tools.
I suspect as much because there is no shortage
of SAs that do not know how to configure
a network interface by using command line tools.
Personally, I dislike that fluff.
Always riding in the side car
does not teach a person
how to operate a motorcycle.

&gt;<i> The problem with making novice too n00b, is I often mount my /home off
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere in the distance and traditionally like a /var on it's own
</I>&gt;<i> partition too (for no good reason anymore). having /usr/local separate
</I>&gt;<i> is nice too sometimes ;)
</I>
I failed to recognize how that is a problem.
Sorcerer boxes can have as many partitions
as the SA wants to create.


&gt;<i> Just the prompts telling me what I should be doing next, and yes, to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid the botching of an install, your safeguard to require a 2GB+ /boot
</I>&gt;<i> when necessary is all I need. More importantly, I think that's all most
</I>&gt;<i> people need.
</I>
I used to have that thought.
I thought that removing the make menuconfig on linux skill check
from the Sorcerer installation
would be enough to allow anyone to be able to install Sorcerer.
Yet in retrospect &quot;enough&quot; always falls short of being enough for everyone.


&gt;<i> Once more, the ONLY thing I had a problem with before, was figuring out
</I>&gt;<i> how to get through the /etc/fstab process by deleting the swap file and
</I>&gt;<i> having a swap partition instead.
</I>
It is something that can be handled post installation.
The installer creates a swap file merely to help ensure
that the box is not depleted of all available RAM during
the transfer, unarchiving, and compilation steps of installation.


&gt;<i> It will. But... perhaps (If you think it's desirable to move forward
</I>&gt;<i> with such an endeavor) you could call it an Automatic *Trial* install,
</I>&gt;<i> or *Test Drive* install, to enforce the principle that such an install
</I>&gt;<i> is merely a peek, and only that.
</I>
I would if not for fear that the extra word &quot;trial&quot;
would somehow confuse an inexperienced SA.
They might expect that the installation made
was only for test purpose rather than being suitable
for actual deployment of the box.


&gt;<i> As far as helping. um... Well just a couple of things. First, I heard
</I>&gt;<i> that you used to yell at your developers sometimes. Just hearsay, and I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know the context or if they were being pricks themselves.
</I>
:<i>)  I yell as much now as I always have.
</I>The abuse and disrespect that
I unleash with every blood letting word is incredible is it not?
How can anyone possibly get along with me?


&gt;<i> Second, I have limited time, so progress on such a thing would move
</I>&gt;<i> slowly, yet would be a kewl project for me nevertheless to work on.
</I>
Already, the perspective and questions
and dialog has moved the sub-project forward.
When I previously expected that an automatic installation
would merely cause more problems
then I could not form sufficient determination to try it.
But from our discussion I have come to realize
that the menu driven installer could also be used by
SAs that want to delegate a task to an idle user.
And also I am hoping this can become a compromise
where SAs will finally assume responsibility for the outcome
rather than casting blame with words such as,
&quot;the menu driven installer is too difficult.&quot;


&gt;<i> Third, I do have, once again ;), unlimited bandwidth, resources, my own
</I>&gt;<i> Portable IPs under direct assignment from nic.ddn.mil (No, think back
</I>&gt;<i> way further than internic.net)
</I>
About decade ago I worked at nic.mil.
I know exactly what it was then.  :)
We also hosted g.root-servers.net
before the introduction of gtld servers.
It was a long time ago.


&gt;<i> so I have a perfect platform for distro
</I>&gt;<i> devel in a vmware environment. And I'm at One Wilshire now :)
</I>
Basically, we discuss ideas,
I eventually write some sort of an implementation, we try it,
and then we discuss how pathetic and disappointing it is.
After repeating the process
and finally achieving what seems passable
then we run with it for a few years.
As with most things 90% is discussion and 10% is implementation.


&gt;<i> I'm a believer in giving back. You can call me a collector, or a
</I>&gt;<i> believer, but I always keep a Slackware subscription, not because I want
</I>&gt;<i> the official DVDs (I never open them), but because Pat needs money to
</I>&gt;<i> feed his family and continue that distro.
</I>
Interesting.
I somehow expected that Slackware
had 3 people as the main developers.
Does Pat do everything?


&gt;<i> I like Sorcerer, and I apologize for not having been able to offer more
</I>&gt;<i> support related articles about it on my website.
</I>
Thanks for the response.
As usual there is more to do than can be done.
If a SA does not want to contribute to one of my current sub-projects
then they are welcome to begin their own sub-projects
based upon what they perceive should be done
and whether or not the task can be accomplished
and seems sufficiently amusing.

The most noteworthy sub-project of Sorcerer was probably
Jan's initial port of Sorcerer IA32 to x86_64.
It was not easy to accomplish, not fast to accomplish,
but he stuck it out with heroic tenacity and made it happen!
That goes to show that I do not always have to [*lol*]
&quot;yell at developers&quot; to get something done.

With as many sub-projects as I allow glide into vaporware
one might expect that I never crack a whip on anyone's head.
That is because I realize that the best outcome will come
from those who feel self-motivated to do the task.
Anyone that could benefit from me cracking the whip
obviously was not the person destined to accomplish the task.

So I realize that some people want to help,
but most will not be able to complete what they start.
There is no shame in it.
That is just how it goes.
It is not worth becoming upset about.

The worst real developer contention that happened with Sorcerer
was during the era of companion grimoires.
I would change the definition of a spell
and these independent grimoire gurus
were neglecting to maintain and update the spells
that they provided in their companion grimoires.
My perspective was that
I was continuing the evolution of Sorcerer
according to what SAs expect and request.
Grimoire gurus point of view was that I was making pointless
changes in order to further increase their workload.

I can barely think of a good analogy to describe it.
It would be as if the farmer's horse, named Mr. Ed, said,
&quot;Wilbur, we already discussed this last year.
This year we will not be planting new seed.
Instead I will be eating hay, sleeping in late,
and making telephone calls from my stall.&quot;

Eventually, all the external companion grimoires came to an end
because SAs were unwilling to maintain their grimoires
at the same quality level as I maintained the 2000+ official grimoire.

Maybe some people felt that I was being unreasonable and hostile?
However, Sorcerer boxes were malfunctioning
after SAs decided to install companion grimoires.
At first I tried to write additional functions to detect and
correct some generic errors in spells from companion grimoires.

Let us entertain a hypothetical scenario.
Let us assume that Kyle is so generous with his time
as to allocate an entire week once a year to Sorcerer development.
What then would Sorcerer be?
Would Kyle still merit the title of distribution leader?
Would any such person who devotes
a whole entire week each year
merit the title of grimoire guru?

&gt;<i>From my point of view grimoire gurus were demanding zero change,
</I>expecting zero change, allocating less than minimal time to their duty,
and were causing problems for Sorcerer SAs.
&gt;<i>From their point of view, Kyle was making unnecessary changes
</I>for his own personal whims that were destabilizing the distribution
and causing the grimoire guru's generous effort to goto waste.
Which point of view is correct?
I do not know.
I only knew who was doing their work
and who was flaming the email lists.

Hindsight is 20/20.
If I could have done it again
then I would have immediately rejected the idea of
anyone maintaining an additional external Sorcerer grimoire.
But I did not properly anticipate their commitment level.
Consequently, good effort went to waste.

Did I crack the whip on people?
I only wanted Sorcerer boxes to work.
Should I have halted development of the entire distribution
for a few people who refused to march forward?
What would anyone else have done
if they were in my position?
What does anyone expect that I did?

The only thing that I can be certain about is
that nobody affiliated with Sorcerer ever has
nor ever will have as much dedication to the project as I do.
Therefore, when I properly expect a 0% outcome from each volunteer
then I can be pleasantly surprised when I am wrong.
Consequently, I delegate no permanent duties to anyone
where the falter in their performance will wreck Sorcerer.
It is as the old cliche suggests,
&quot;If I want something done right then I must do it myself.&quot;

Anything worth losing a night's sleep over
I will do by myself.
So there is no reason to yell, argue, crack whips.
I am the kind of boss that says,
&quot;If you want...
then go ahead and take a year long paid vacation from work.
Do not worry about it.
I have your back covered.
And I will do everything
that you said that you would do.
So have yourself a good time
and waste no time thinking about me.&quot;
Is that the wrong attitude for a boss?

This might seem like a complaint,
but I never wanted a distribution.
If I wanted a distro I would have forked Debian or Redhat.
Instead, I wanted sorcery, a tool for source based distribution.
And originally, I intended to have it as an addon to
pre-compiled based distros.
I wanted something like zero-install-injector,
but for sources rather than pre-compiled software.
Yet SAs convinced me to create Sorcerer.
And so here it is.

Managers tend to be people who lack skill
and enjoying cracking whips.
Instead I enjoy achieving accomplishment from my own effort.
Please carefully contrast the difference
between the people who fork a distribution
because they want to become a distribution leader
with a person who has had the burden
of distribution managerial duties thrust upon him.

Perhaps contributing to Sorcerer is like a party?
When it is no longer fun
then people go home.
Yet I remain to clean things up.
