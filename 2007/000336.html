<PRE>The transition has been easier on some boxes than others.
First, udev is started by the currently recommend method
instead of the deprecated way.
The deprecated way ran an executable called udevstart
However, that executable is no longer built by default.
The new way invokes:

/sbin/udev
followed by
/sbin/udevtrigger

That causes all the &quot;cold-plugged&quot; udev events
for devices already installed
to be re-issued while udev handles
creating the devices nodes and loading the appropriate modules.

Then:
/sbin/udevsettle  --timeout=10

is executed.
That causes a delay up to 10 seconds for udev to handle events,
such as loading the drivers required in order to access
IDE, SCSI, ATA, SATA, and PATA drives.
One person has already reported that:
/sbin/udevsettle  --timeout=10
might not end after 10 seconds.
However, on my boxes it does.
Following that report I updated udev to
version 118 which hopefully has fixed
whatever problem exists or exited in /sbin/udevsettle

Note udev is not started merely once.
It is started twice.

# ls /etc/rc.d/*/*udev | cat
/etc/rc.d/init.d/udev
/etc/rc.d/rc1.d/S00udev
/etc/rc.d/rc2.d/S00udev
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S00udev
/etc/rc.d/rc4.d/S00udev
/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S00udev
/etc/rc.d/rcS.d/S01udev

udev start in sysinit rcS.d
then it restarts in runlevels 1 2 3 4 5
Why twice?

Boxes deployed with the newer I/Rs,
that I am still testing,
begin initial booting using a generic modular kernel
and an initramfs image.
However, the initramfs image does not contain
modules for all possible devices.
It only contains modules that will probably be required during boot.
Such as modules for IDE SCSI ATA SATA PATA and filesystems.
Therefore, the first time /sbin/udevtrigger runs
it will be unable to load modules for all installed devices.
Consequently, /sbin/udevtrigger is run again during the runlevel startup.
During the restart it transitions to running udev from the real root filesystem.
The real root filesystem contains a /lib/modules/
that includes all the modules build for the running kernel.
Now udev can finish loading modules and creating device nodes
for all installed hardware.

There is, of course, a longer explanation which I will skip for now.
But the point is please check:

# ls /etc/rc.d/*/*udev | cat

Check that udev is starting both in sysinit and runlevels 1 2 3 4 5


$ ls /etc/rc.d/rcS.d | cat
S00loglevel
S00proc
S00sys
S01hostname
S01udev
S02devpts
S02lvm
S02modprobe
S03loadkeys
S04find_ir
S04fsck
S05mount
S06fuse
S06hwclock
S06loopback
S07msyslog
S08dmesg
S09welcome

That is what symbolic links in the sysinit directory
look like on a recently deployed Sorcerer box.
Note, steps are no longer
S0, S1, S2, S3
But instead
S00, S01, S02, S03, S04 ... S99

This change was necessary as in some conditions there could be more
than 9 distinct order groups to sequence parallel init script startup.
And while the naming method for symbolic links apply to sysinit
Only runlevels 2 and 4 support parallel init script execution for
faster startups.

There are no symbolic links to hoplug any runlevel or sysinit directory.
hotplug is no longer used.
udev handles both hot-plugging and cold-plugging events.

Feel free to dispel hotplug
if it does not remove itself.

At the moment I am writing this email:
# augur available grimoire
2007-363

# augur available sorcery
implosion-20071229-0

If there is any problem with updating the grimoire to current
then it may be overcome by:
# rm /root/.sorcery/*
# augur merge; augur index; cast grimoire

Most boxes with LAG=1 will receive grimoire version 2007-362
and sorcery version implosion-20071227-0
if they were updating at this moment.

Aside from a potential hang with udevsettle which does not occur on all boxes,
no big bad boot bumbling bugs are known to exist.

Aside from the above mentioned changes to udev, hotplug, sysvinit,
init-functions,
linux-modular, initramfs there is nothing much else to report except
updates are going into the grimoire as usual.

If you spot a bug happening during boot
please give a detailed report as to what is causing
it and how to fix it as it maybe a distribution wide problem
which should be fixed distribution wide.
Any more details information regarding why and on what boxes
that udevsettle --timeout 10  hangs is appreciated.

Most SAs will probably not see the new linux-modular and initramfs until
their next deployment with the newer IRs.
The newer IRs may install more software onto a new box
than you would expect can fit on an ISO9660.
It will completely skip the skill check of configuring a linux kernel.
Yes, installation will probably be faster since the linux kernel will
not be compiled.

Additionally, the I/Rs contain KDE.
Somewhere over the last couple of years I became a KDE addict.
But I loathe the lengthy compilation.
The new I/Rs with xorg and KDE will be fast to install
and even faster to strip off the KDE if you prefer Gnome
or a lighter window manager and/or desktop environment
or even none at all.

Although the new I/Rs are KDE ready
they are not intended to be &quot;Live CDs&quot;
The default init is still runlevel 3.
We will continue to enjoy the simplicity
of a menu driven console based installation.
But you could try starting the X server if you wanted.
But there is no guarantee that xorg's auto-detection
will not blow older monitors when it tries to start using
Linux framebuffer, svga, or vga drivers and guessed/detected mode values.

The long development time of the new I/Rs is in part due to
compiling the x86_64 software.
Thanks to Mr. Jim Decker's temporary loan of an x86_64 box
much of the KDE and xorg components were compiled
on an actual x86_64 box and not in qemu's x86_64 simulator.

I am as eager to release the new I/Rs as you are to use them.
The switch to a modular kernel with udev cold plugging should
enable booting and installation on any ia32 or x86_64 box for
which the vanilla linux kernel has appropriate drivers.


For those curious about the costs of booting with an initramfs
and modular kernel, but not eager to ask, read onward.
Otherwise, feel free to archive the rest for later reading
upon deploying boxes with the newer IRs.

The performance loss for using the modular kernel
is very negligible and not a factor for most uses of a Linux box.
However, more space is required on /boot

/boot/initrf.gz will exist.
It will be a gziped cpio that contains
truncated sets of modules for up to 4 linux kernels.
The initramfs also contains copies of
/bin /etc /lib /lib64 /sbin of the real root filesystem.
If a problem does occur during boot
that prevents mounting the real root filesystem
then plenty of utilities are available for the SA
to debug the problem without using an I/R CD.

The larger initramfs image uses more memory during boot.
However, this is rarely a problem.
Most Sorcerer boxes have plenty of RAM to spare.
After booting is complete the initramfs image is not destroyed.
Although it remains virtually inaccessible the ramfs filesystem
will act as if it is a tmpfs filesystem.
If the RAM being used by the initramfs is required
then linux will move the content from the initramfs
image from RAM to swap space.

Most of my prejudices against
using modular kernels come from a time when:

1. Hard drives were tiny.
2. 64M was a generous loadout of RAM.
3. Modular linux kernels contained only optimizations
    for the architecture for which the kernel was built.
4. Ramdisk images contained a very stripped down set
    of utilities if any at all which made debugging a boot problem
    difficult if not impossible if it occurs before
    the real root filesystem is mounted.

And compared with today:

1. 0.5 Terabyte fixed disks are no longer uncommon.
2. 2 through 4 gigabytes of RAM is not uncommon.
3. CONFIG_X86_GENERIC=y and a generic kernel receives
    optimizations for more than merely the microprocessor selected
4. initramfs can contain near complete copies of /bin /etc /lib /lib64 /sbin


Still there are some banes that remain:

While a generic linux kernel requires no configuration
it requires almost a magnitude more time to compile
than most custom and precisely configured linux kernels.

initramfs images do require a larger /boot

Failing to mount the real root filesystem is still an unnerving experience
even when the initramfs does contain enough programs to circumvent
the problem and continue booting and then repair the problem on the
real root filesystem.

Use of an initramfs may cause shutdown to be a bit slower since
the initramfs is checked and rebuilt when required during
runlevels 0 6 to ensure on the next boot that the initramfs image
is current with any modifications the SA made to the box.

But it has some boons also:

SAs with the potential to become senior level
but insufficient hardware knowledge can enjoy
wielding sorcery without proving themselves
with a linux kernel configuration.

Creating and updating the I/Rs will be easier since
the linux kernel on the I/Rs will be the same as the
deployed kernel on boxes which is linux-modular.

Sorcerer can be deployed without the SA having to read
the output from lspci, lsusb, and other diagnostic programs
to identify installed hardware.
Basically, if it looks like an X86_64 or IA32
then Sorcerer will probably install on it.

Hopefully, the changes to booting and installing that includes
using a modular kernel, initramfs image, xorg, and KDE
will enable Sorcerer to remain a viable choice for deployment
for yet a few more years since it provides
most of the convenience of installing a pre-compiled binary based distro
with the power of sorcery source based management.

By being considerably late in the game when it comes to
providing an modular kernel and initramdisk/initramfs boot
the Sorcerer distribution has nothing to be concerned about
remaining backward compatible.
Existing deployments of Sorcerer can remain deployed using linux
or updated to using linux-modular if the SA chooses.
The changes are for SA convenience.
They do not enforce a change over to a new standard,
nor do they require the SA to learn anything new.
You can continue with custom linux configuration or
leave it to the distribution maintainers to decide what is best.

Assuming the transitions are uneventful these changes will provide
Sorcerer SAs with more choices between greater convenience
while at the same time not sacrificing any of the configure-ability
that may be considered mission critical for the roles of our Sorcerer boxes.

For those still reading, no doubt the most helpful of Sorcerer SAs,
I want to open for discussion the following topics:

Should certain sensible optionals such as alsa-lib
be considered instead mandatory requirements for
all software that can used alsa-lib for audio output?
Note that linux-modular only contains ALSA driver modules and not OSS.
However, ALSA does have an OSS compatibility module to enable
programs that can not natively use ALSA device nodes to continue
using OSS device nodes.

Are there any other libraries or programs that are optional that
should be instead set as mandatory requirements in spells.
Such libraries that are already done this way are:
ncurses
readline

Currently, authentication for newly deployed Sorcerer boxes
is by shadow passwords.
However, the Sorcerer grimoire has spells for many types of
authentication methods, in fact more than I currently remember.
However, to list a few:
Linux-PAM
PADL's openldap
heimdal's kerberos 5.
shishi's kerberos 5.
NIS
freeradius
radius
samba
SQL

Should the default installation of Sorcerer for I/Rs released sometime in
2008 have a default configuration better suited for using a more
complex network/enterprise based authentication where each Sorcerer
box can authenticate users from a networked server dedicated to
user authentication?
Please feel free to elaborate on what authentication methods you
have deployed and how they are useful or problematic.

Happy New Year.
