</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Actually, the current system does support these types of chains.

</I>&gt;<i> No, it does not support, unless you make new spell as you have done but i

</I>
Well.... nether do I like it as a split spell.
But it is a rare occasion that it might actually
work better that way without causing additional problems.


&gt;<i> I propose that current system should be improved in way that there is no
</I>&gt;<i> need to split spells, but to improve requirement chain checking to include
</I>&gt;<i> to check that needed optional requirements is set to on.
</I>
That is easy to think of, easy to suggest, and easy to implement.
It really has only one cost.
Speed!
The way requirements are written currently is a bit slow to handle
when checking to see if a spell about to be cast has already been
properly configured in respect to optional requirements.
I may have been merely lucky that I was able to deduce a bash
command to properly separate the spell in front of the : from
the stuff that follows in order to be able to quickly generate
the grimoire index.
Adding onto the specification for an optional requirement
will make cast slower while providing a functionality that currently
is required for only 1 spell and perhaps at most no more than 5 spells.
Consequently, the the benefit does not outweigh the cost.
I should not expand the
&quot;spell:--enable-something:--disable-something:description of it&quot;
to
&quot;spell:--enable-something:--disable-something:description of it:also required&quot;


&gt;<i> I think current system stores optional requirement to some file, i am right?
</I>
Names of optionally required spells are stored in files
during the generation of the grimoire index.
When optionals for a spell are selected by the SA those
selections are stored in files for the spell such that:

/etc/sorcery/log/opt.on/httpd
/etc/sorcery/log/opt.off/httpd

those files describe what optionals were selected as on and off
for the httpd spell.

And of course you are already familiar with how optionals are written in spells:

REQ=( &quot;ncurses readline&quot;
      &quot;gdb:--enable-gdb:--disable-gdb:for debugging support&quot; )

Where all elements of array REQ beyond ${REQ[0]} specify
optionally required spells and/or optional configuration switches.


&gt;<i> so why cant there be support so sorcerer checks if particular optional part
</I>&gt;<i> is on or off, if its off, then its re-cast that spell with that optional
</I>&gt;<i> part forced as on?
</I>
There can be such support.
However, there is no truly eloquent place to implement it.
Extending the definition of an optional requirement
makes cast a bit slower.
Custom coding the check into the kdegraphics spell
lacks a specific section where it should go.
It is perhaps possible to put it in something like
pre_build() {
do_the_check
default_pre_build }

But if CAST_RATE=1
then the current compilation of kdegraphics would
have to be aborted in the event that poppler required
recompilation.
If CAST_RATE&gt;1 then at the very least the compilation
of kdegraphics would have to be delayed within the
pre_build until poppler finished re-compilation if it is
necessary to adjust the previously selected optionals
for poppler and to re-compile poppler.

Ideally, I might have to a new variable in the SPELL
and have a section added onto satisfy_required()
that makes certain a previously installed spell's
optional requirements are properly selected
and if not adjusts that and inserts the spell into
the cast queue to be re-compiled.



&gt;<i> Poppler &amp; kdegraphics is not only place which this
</I>&gt;<i> feature is needed, there are other KDE spells that needs spells with
</I>&gt;<i> optional requirement on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Example in this case, with poppler and kdegraphics. kdegraphics REQ-line is
</I>&gt;<i> (now with splitted spell):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        REQ=( &quot;glut kdelibs lcms&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>              &quot;sane-backends:::for libkscan/kooka&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>              &quot;gphoto2:::for digital still camera support&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>              &quot;imlib:::to build the graphics browser/viewer KuickShow&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>              &quot;fribidi:::for viewing right to left texts&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;poppler-qt-x11-free:--with-poppler:--without-poppler:for
</I>&gt;<i> enhanced PDF support&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>              &quot;openexr:--with-openexr:--without-openexr:for
</I>&gt;<i> OpenEXR support&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>              &quot;tiff:--with-tiff:--without-tiff:for TIFF
</I>&gt;<i> image support&quot; )
</I>&gt;<i> #            &quot;arts:--with-arts:--without-arts:for sound
</I>&gt;<i> support&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could mark poppler like this:
</I>&gt;<i>        REQ=( &quot;glut kdelibs lcms&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>              &quot;sane-backends:::for libkscan/kooka&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>              &quot;gphoto2:::for digital still camera support&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>              &quot;imlib:::to build the graphics browser/viewer KuickShow&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>              &quot;fribidi:::for viewing right to left texts&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;poppler/qt-x11-free:--with-poppler:--without-poppler:for
</I>&gt;<i> enhanced PDF support&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>              &quot;openexr:--with-openexr:--without-openexr:for
</I>&gt;<i> OpenEXR support&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>              &quot;tiff:--with-tiff:--without-tiff:for TIFF
</I>&gt;<i> image support&quot; )
</I>&gt;<i> #            &quot;arts:--with-arts:--without-arts:for sound
</I>&gt;<i> support&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So &lt;spell&gt;/&lt;optional requirement&gt;[/&lt;optional requirement&gt;]...etc.  so
</I>&gt;<i> poppler/qt-x11-free means that optional requirement qt-x11-free is needed
</I>&gt;<i> on.
</I>
Ah, that's good thinking excpet one thing...
Let us call it
A/Z:B:C:D
and
A:B:C:D

Spell X is has the above optionally required spell A
In the second example it is obvious if A is selected
that X's configure receives B and if not X's configure
receives parameter C
However in the example above that what spell receives B or C?
Does spell A receive B or C
Does spell X receive B or C

Sorry, if I am making it more complicate than it is.
The point is clearly that the currently defined optional
requirement method is not flexibile enough to specify
whether spell A should or should not have certain optional
requirements selected.

Really, there is no eloquent method for correcting the potential
mistake of having accidentally selected or not selected a certain
optional for a spell short of recasting that spell such as
# cast -r -c $SPELL

Any ideas I have for implementing such support
I can describe only with the word ugly.

poppler and poppler-qt-x11-free may be ugly,
but it is less ugly than designing a new variable
to use in the DETAILS section of a spell.
I try to think of it as a type of wrapper solution.

Let us say you have 3 commands you want executed by a cronjob.
Of course a cronjob line only allows for the execution of a single command.
So what does one do?
They place those 3 commands within a shell script.
And the shell script acts as a wrapper to in a way
extend the functionality of executing multiple commands
per cronjob to cron without actually having to modify cron source code.

The solution of having two spells that can provide poppler
accomplish the desired goal of having the correctly configured
poppler installed without having to overall sorcery code.
And the reason that sorcery code will probably not change
is the same reason that crontab has remained relatively
unchanged for years...
Adding the additional desired functionality adds complexity,
slowness, ugliness, and while the goal can be accomplished
easily enough by using a script to wrap and control the commands.

So the question of whether or not we can do that with sorcery
is not as important as the speculation of how unhappy we would
make ourselves by the added complexity and ugliness if we did
implement the additional functionality.


&gt;<i> All is needed that sorcerer checks if that optional part is on, if not, then
</I>&gt;<i> its re-casted with that option locked on.
</I>&gt;<i> Allthough locked optional requirements needs some sort support so end user
</I>&gt;<i> cant later re-cast spell and check off option that is needed elsewhere...
</I>&gt;<i> some sort of locked.on files?
</I>
locking optional requirements for another spell as on or off definitely
requires some additional and very spell specific custom code.
In other words, to do it right with kdegraphics actually requires
some lines of bash code within kdegraphics rather than trying
to use some ugly variable to straighten out the wrinkles.
However, there is a slight problem.
By the time kdegraphics is ready to compile it is either do it or fail it.
if poppler is not installed correctly by the time kdegraphics begins
compilation then it aught to be too late to do anything except
abort kdegraphics and insert poppler into the cast queue.
That is sort of sticky since there is no mechanism for a spell
to both abort itself and also re-insert itself into the cast queue.

Locking the optional as on or off is another difficult problem
since the SA could at any type either directly edit the
optional requirements for that spell with a text editor or
issue cast -r --deps on it.
Of course with a spell such as
poppler-qt-x11-free
qt-x11-free is a truly locked requirement since it is not an optional.
With a split spell solution we have a situation
that the SA can not as easily fight or accidentally disrupt.

Although there are not many examples of split spells,
none that I can think of,
spells are not always spells in the traditional sense.
glibc-locales has no source and compiles nothing.
profile spells like xf86-input has no source and therefore
does no compilation, but is very useful to have as a spell.
Those quasi spells act like wrappers.
Therefore, what can not so easily be accomplished with
sorcery can usually be accomplished with a spell.

One of the reasons that I am fond of sorcery is the great flexibility
that spells have entirely because spells are BASH script fragments.
The definition of a spell does not have to be overly rigid and placed
in files that have exact spacing where each line has a specific meaning.
Therefore, since spells are more flexibile than pre-formated text/data files
I do not find it unreasonable to sometimes use a spell to surpass the
ordinary design limitations of sorcery.
That way the system can flex and accommodate change
rather than snap and break.


&gt;<i> Any comments, would this be better than spell splitting/inheriting?
</I>
Yes, I agree that the definition of a spell can be improved.
Exactly, how that should be handled it not yet apparent.
Rarely desired functionality should not come at an extraordinary
cost in speed and/or functionality.
Ideally, a change in the definition of a spell should make
sorcery overall faster, spell less complex, and grant better functionality.
Now you might be thinking....
Wait, that is too much to ask for.
But in the past we had variables $REQ and $OPT in spells
and there was at one time a $SHORT_DESC and a $LONG_DESC
But now there is merely $REQ and $DESC
And it is faster and less complex.
Therefore, the definition of a spell, has in the past, progressed
towards becoming faster, easier, and more functional.

If we are to modify the definition of a spell we should not
be too hasty that we fail to achieve what we will ultimately
desire in the first attempt.
Nor should we be hasty in implementing any change that
breaks backward compatibility.
I am not imply that the definition of a spell is set in stone.
However, it should be clear that modifications to sorcery
or the definition of a spell have boons that outweigh the costs.

In the 5 or more ways I considered handling the
poppler's necessary optional requirement on qt-x11-free
when poppler is optionally required by kdegraphics
the split spell implementation provides the least ugly
solution that requires the least amount of effort and
incurs the least probability of introducing bugs into
sorcery and/or the grimoire while providing the
desired outcome of having the correctly compiled
poppler installed before kdegraphics begins compilation.
More simply put it is the lesser of several evils.
But I do detest splitting spells.
