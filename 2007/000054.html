<PRE>&gt;<i> it works on mine.... it dispell glibc and I can still run stuff
</I>&gt;<i> did you noticed that my install log for glibc is empty? can it
</I>&gt;<i> come from that?
</I>
If the install log for glibc is empty
then then the install log for glibc is incorrect.
# dispel glibc
can not remove files installed by glibc
nor transfer ELF libraries installed by glibc
from /lib and /usr/lib to /usr/lib.old

If you make modifications to /etc/sorcery/log/install/glibc
then also make modifications to /etc/sorcery/log/id/glibc
When dispelling glibc the ID log is used to determine what
files are ELF libraries to be saved in /usr/lib.old
Consequently, if the ID log for glibc is also incorrect
then dispel glibc will probably break the box severely
since important glibc shared libraries will be deleted
outright instead of being saved in the library cache, /usr/lib.old

If you want to construct an install and ID logs for the installed
version of glibc then I recommend using the one's provided on
the I/R for reference.  Many of the files will not have exactly
the same name if for example the installed glibc is 2.3.5 and
the glibc from the I/R is 2.3.6.  The names of some symbolic
links may also differ.  Simply having a populated, but inaccurate,
install and ID log for glibc will also not work when it comes time to
cast and dispel glibc.

You can make an archive
from the glibc installed on the I/R.
Then, that archive can be installed on the fixed disk filesystem.
However, the left over glibc files installed on the fixed disk
from previous installs of glibc that are now untracked
must be removed manually because they are alien files which
may prevent a successful dispel or cast of glibc.

glibc is not the same as any other
software component of an operating system.
For glibc to dispel and cast correctly
glibc must be cleanly installed and accurately tracked.

If I wanted to make an archive for the glibc
installed on an IR I might do the following:

# mount /media/cd
# cat /media/cd/etc/sorcery/log/install/glibc  |
sed  &quot;s:^/media/cd::&quot;  |
tar  --no-recursion -cPT -  &gt;  /tmp/glibc-archive-$(&lt;
/media/cd/etc/sorcery/log/version/glibc ).tar

The about would then created /tmp/glibc-archive-$VERSION.tar
which could be extract by executing:

# cd /
# tar --overwrite --overwrite-dir -xf /tmp/glibc-archive-*.tar
# /sbin/ldconfig

Then, I would weed out aliens from /lib and /usr/lib using
instructions similar to those provided in previous messages.

However, my first choice would be to repair the install and
ID logs to properly track the installed version of glibc rather
than trying to blindly overwrite whatever is installed by
using an archive created from the I/R.
There may be unwanted consequences for having tar
try to overwrite files that are in use.
They files once written may have size 0
which could cause an immediate break.
If that happened then the file would have to be removed
first using rm and then copied using cp or re-extracted
fro mthe archive.

Here is another easy way of looking at it....
Probably any file directly installed in /lib that is not tracked
was probably installed by glibc.
Once you have that list is easy enough to weed
those that are from gblic from those that are not.
Then, if you have an install log for glibc creating an ID log for glibc is easy:

# su -
# . /etc/sorcery/config
# fileid  &lt;  /etc/sorcery/log/install/glibc &gt; /etc/sorcery/log/id/glibc
# exit
