Please go ahead and dispel busybox.
Although it is installed, by default, and used during the boot of the I/R
it is never used after that.
I should go ahead and adjust the update criteria for busybox
to dispel it on deployed Sorcerer boxes.

Almost all spell use the gcc spell for compilation.
If that is okay, then compilation should be okay.
Starting over is not advised since there is typically
no problems too difficult to surmount after managing
to configure the linux kernel, install the skeleton, boot
the box, and have it connect to the network.
After that it only becomes easier.  :)
Another aspect to consider is that the updated I/R
are built ontop of the old I/R for the most part simply
by doing the same that would be accomplished by
augur sync; augur newer; augur update
Ultimately, if you try to spot and fix the problems you
may learn and hone your skills.

I do not mean to seem insensitive.
When I was a novice I reinstalled distros like
Redhat and Debian multiple times on a box.
I understand that nagging feeling and thought
that perhaps I installed the wrong thing or omitted
something else or made some mistake,
and that starting over with a fresh install
I will be able to get it entirely correct this time.
But eventually you can work through it and
it will only be a memory.

Sometime before I created Sorcerer
I was doing Debian installations without
using the Debian menu driven installer.
Easily most Sorcerer SAs could do a Sorcerer installation
without using the sorcerer menu driven installer.
Eventually, a comprehensive understanding of what must
be done step by step to deploy a Sorcerer box will become
as apparent and easy to do as walking and talking concurrently.
Yes it does become that easy.

That is why I encourage you to ride out the roughness.
If the problems do seem insurmountable you can always redeploy,
but there may be much yet to learn before that.
Lastly if the box is not sensitive and you want me to take a look at it,
I can lend you my public ssh key so I can log in as a guest and
take a quick look.
There is usually no problem on a sorcerer box that once
identified can not be fixed with 5 commands or less.
It is usually far faster than the time required to reinstall
and then reupdate from an I/R that is 6 months or older.

&gt;<i> Thanks for you help and suggestions.  I'm very impressed at the level of
</I>&gt;<i> support around here.
