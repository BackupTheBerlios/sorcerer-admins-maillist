<PRE>Ok, so over the past week I've done what I could on this issue when I've had
time.  I have played around with a fe things and I'm pretty sure I'm having
a failure of my gcc.  Some things seem to compile, but a majority of them
fail.  I have tried to dispel gcc, then cast -c -r it again to try and fix
it.  I have done an 'augur synch' within the past thirty minutes, and the
version of gcc available is 4.2.1.  This is what I have on my box right
now.  Anyway, when I try and re-cast gcc I get the following lines.
&quot;Fail: Sun Aug 19 .... binutil 2.17 autofailed by binutils&quot;
&quot;Fail Sun Aug 19..... gcc 4.2.1 autofailed by db&quot;

I've tried to dispel and cast binutils and db.  Both generated the
'autofailed by ...' where they seem to fail themselves.

I tried an 'augur update' earlier today, and got lots and lots of compile
failures.  Not everything failed though.  I don't see an obvious correlation
between what failed and what didn't.

I do see that I have gcc-v3.0 and gcc-v4.0 installed on my box.  I believe
this is from the original install.  Is there anyway to dispel gcc and use
either of these to try and rebuild the newest version of gcc?  And if I do
that, don't I have to go back to previous versions of glibc?  I seem to
remember reading somewhere that glibc and gcc are tied together at the
version level.

Thanks for any suggestions.

Nathan

</I>&gt;<i> I should go ahead and adjust the update criteria for busybox

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, I am going to start over again from scratch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Almost all spell use the gcc spell for compilation.
</I>&gt;<i> If that is okay, then compilation should be okay.
</I>&gt;<i> Starting over is not advised since there is typically
</I>&gt;<i> no problems too difficult to surmount after managing
</I>&gt;<i> to configure the linux kernel, install the skeleton, boot
</I>&gt;<i> the box, and have it connect to the network.
</I>&gt;<i> After that it only becomes easier.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> Another aspect to consider is that the updated I/R
</I>&gt;<i> are built ontop of the old I/R for the most part simply
</I>&gt;<i> by doing the same that would be accomplished by
</I>&gt;<i> augur sync; augur newer; augur update
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimately, if you try to spot and fix the problems you
</I>&gt;<i> may learn and hone your skills.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not mean to seem insensitive.
</I>&gt;<i> When I was a novice I reinstalled distros like
</I>&gt;<i> Redhat and Debian multiple times on a box.
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that nagging feeling and thought
</I>&gt;<i> that perhaps I installed the wrong thing or omitted
</I>&gt;<i> something else or made some mistake,
</I>&gt;<i> and that starting over with a fresh install
</I>&gt;<i> I will be able to get it entirely correct this time.
</I>&gt;<i> But eventually you can work through it and
</I>&gt;<i> it will only be a memory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sometime before I created Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> I was doing Debian installations without
</I>&gt;<i> using the Debian menu driven installer.
</I>&gt;<i> Easily most Sorcerer SAs could do a Sorcerer installation
</I>&gt;<i> without using the sorcerer menu driven installer.
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually, a comprehensive understanding of what must
</I>&gt;<i> be done step by step to deploy a Sorcerer box will become
</I>&gt;<i> as apparent and easy to do as walking and talking concurrently.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes it does become that easy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is why I encourage you to ride out the roughness.
</I>&gt;<i> If the problems do seem insurmountable you can always redeploy,
</I>&gt;<i> but there may be much yet to learn before that.
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly if the box is not sensitive and you want me to take a look at it,
</I>&gt;<i> I can lend you my public ssh key so I can log in as a guest and
</I>&gt;<i> take a quick look.
</I>&gt;<i> There is usually no problem on a sorcerer box that once
</I>&gt;<i> identified can not be fixed with 5 commands or less.
</I>&gt;<i> It is usually far faster than the time required to reinstall
</I>&gt;<i> and then reupdate from an I/R that is 6 months or older.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for you help and suggestions.  I'm very impressed at the level of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support around here.
