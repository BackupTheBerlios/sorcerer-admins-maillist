</I>&gt;<i> well I don't think so, anyway when you install sorcerer you read the

</I>
It was not obvious to me and I designed it and wrote the readme file.
each file directly in /etc/networks.d/
represents either a network or networks.
Each file is executed with start on start and stop on stop.
It should return 0 if successful 1 if not successful.
There is need for a nest of subdirectories in /etc/networks.d/

Yes templates can not merely be cat together.
Having a template raise more than one network
can require significant modification.

However, let us say that I redo it.
Any directory, except the example directory
under /etc/networks.d/ becomes a directory that
represents a group of networks to be started and stopped together.

For this example let
/etc/networks.d/0_home/eth0
/etc/networks.d/0_home/pppoe

/etc/networks.d/1_office/dhcp
/etc/networks.d/1_office/wlan0

Something like the above.

The box is at home
The box is booted.
The ISP is flaking.
However, eth0 comes up fine.
Should the networks in /etc/networks.d/1_office also be raised or not?

The box is at the office.
It is booted.
It starts with /etc/networks.d/0_home/eth0
success even though the box is at home.
The SA did not modify the script correctly to check DNS.
/etc/networks.d/0_home/pppoe fails
Does /etc/init.d/networks try to raise networks in
/etc/networks.d/office ?
It already raised one network in /etc/networks.d/0_home.

As I stated before.
There is far too much ambiguity in what is proper to be done
with multiple networks being raised from modified templates
stored in a directory that represents a location.

Now let us say there are just these two

/etc/networks.d/0_home
/etc/networks.d/1_office

/etc/init.d/networks does not care if one or more networks is raised
by 0_home or 1_office.
All it cares about is the exit value when run.
So it first runs 0_home
does it exit 0?
Yes.  no need to run 1_office.
No, time to run 1_office

That is simple.
That is clear.
This way the SA can define whether or not if one only one network
is raised in 0_home if that constitutes a success or a failure.
For example eth0 might be possible to establish at both home and office.
However, home is not home unless pppoe also raises.
Therefore, the SA can modify the template so that a failure of pppoe
exits 1 and therefore 1_office receives a chance at being raised.


&gt;<i> all networks have to be considered independant and should be tried to get up
</I>&gt;<i> if fact the current method is by far less usefull than the previous
</I>
All networks are not independent.
They may depend upon location.
pppoe may depend on eth0 being raised first.
pppoe may create and use a virtual device by virtual device
runs through the actual hardware device eth0, yes?
Likewise if one us using many wlan wireless networks
then the network to connect to probably depends on
where the box happens to be.
Therefore, if connecting to one fails
then the attempt of another
depends on the first attempt failing.


&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/network one....  because you can't have several network up
</I>&gt;<i> and catenate template isn't a solution... what if I want to restart my
</I>&gt;<i> pppoe without dropping my eth0?
</I>
That is an excellent point.
And it is not something that is addressed by this design.
/etc/init.d/networks is supposed to run at startup and shutdown.
It connects to all the networks it is supposed to and disconnects
from all the networks it is supposed to.
That is what it is designed to do.
It is not designed to be invoked:
/etc/init.d/networks stop pppoe
/etc/init.d/networks start pppoe
But it would have to be in order to satisfy your request.
Because an invocation of /etc/init.d/networks stop
would attempt to drop all your connected networks
irregardless of whether they are defined as:

/etc/networks.d/0
/etc/networks.d/1
or
/etc/networks.d/0/a
/etc/networks.d/0/b
/etc/networks.d/1/a
/etc/networks.d/1/b

You would require something more like

/etc/init.d/networks stop 0/a
in order to specify the precise network to be disconnected.

If you want that then please make and test the
changes to networks in the svn grimoire.
Please maintain backward compatibility
so that after the spell updates boxes continue
to be able to start their networks upon boot as they
are currently defined by files directly within /etc/networks.d/
Please exclude /etc/networks.d/templates/ directory
Please only invoke executables located in /sbin and /bin
Do not invoke /usr/bin/find, for example.
Please try to keep it simple.
The way /etc/init.d/networks is now is very easy for me to see
at a glance what it does and to be able to modify it.
The next person would appreciate if it could remain equally as easy to follow.

Good luck with the modifications.


&gt;<i> maybe the best is to provide templates to copy to /etc/init.d....
</I>
It might be a bit difficult to have them execute in proper order
if they existed in /etc/init.d/
Modified templates are fine within /etc/networks.d/
The control for what should execute in /etc/networks.d/
should be supplied by /etc/init.d/networks
If it were easier the other way around I would have kept
it the way it was before when such things as

/etc/init.d/eth0
/etc/init.d/network
/etc/init.d/ppp0
/etc/init.d/dhcpcd

and such existed in the /etc/init.d/ directory
Tried it, ran with it, discard it.
/etc/networks.d/ is better.


&gt;<i> no, I created the spell recently after getting my ipv6 tunnel and beeing
</I>&gt;<i> unable to use ifconfig to set ip
</I>
created the iproute2 spell?

   VERSION=(                 &quot;2.6.19-061214&quot; &quot;2.6.18-061002&quot;
&quot;2.6.16-060323&quot; &quot;2.6.15-060110&quot; &quot;2.6.15-060110&quot; &quot;2.6.14-051107&quot;
&quot;051007&quot; )

It has many old versions in the version array.
Am I misunderstanding?


&gt;<i> well net-tools lack lot of ipv6 features in fact.... all people I asked
</I>&gt;<i> told me to drop it....
</I>
Okay then.
Let's go over to iproute2.
Please make iproute2 a requirement for networks
and go ahead and modify the templates accordingly.

&gt;<i> no we don't althought it's better to have uniform interface....
</I>&gt;<i> the good thing with ip is also that it can handle route, providing a
</I>&gt;<i> single way to configure everything related to ip
</I>
That probably shaves 5 thousands of a second off the boot time.  :)
But what if we want to change the routing table on the fly to add or
remove a default route for example.
Must we also adjust an interface?


&gt;<i> you can use ipv6 and ipv4 at the same time without problem
</I>&gt;<i> for example I have both since I use a tunnel to connect to the 6thbone....
</I>
That is how I used to do it, a long time ago.
However, I wonder if tunneling IPv6 through IPv4 looses
some of the advantages of IPv6 such as multi-casting?
Anything interesting on the mbone these days?
