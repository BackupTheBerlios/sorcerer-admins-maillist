Nothing to worry about.
Once you get it, in the future it will be easy.
First, you cast xorg.
When it configures xf86-video you will have
to select a driver for the graphics card.
If uncertain, perhaps lshw can tell you what is already in the box.
After it is all compiled and installed the hard part begins.
To make crafting the /etc/X11/xorg.conf easier there is a program
called xorgconfig
When you finish writing the config file, make sure that you copy it to
/etc/X11/xorg.conf if it is not written to that location.

Now that it is installed and configured there is only left to run it.
There are 2 easy approaches to that.
First, you can choose to login to it using kdm, gdm, or xdm.
Secondly, you can start it up from a console shell prompt.
If you use kdm or gdm then those programs will select a window
manager to start automatically.
Otherwise the window manager is loaded by either:
~/.xinitrc if starting using startx from the console
or
~/.xsession if starting use xdm login

One of my favorite light weight window managers is yeahwm.
It is also a good choice for those bewildered by KDM.
For that person I have the following for her .xsession file

/usr/bin/yeahwm &amp;
/usr/bin/firefox -width 960 -height 720


The above works for her because once she is automatically
logged out when she chooses to close the web browser.
Of course if I wanted it so that the window manager had to be
terminated in order for logout then the ~/.xsession file would read:

/usr/bin/yeahwm


This is because once the .xsession file finishes executing the session is over.
The ~/.xinitrc file used by startx works exactly the same way as .xsession.
You could even symbolic link one to the other and that would work fine.

Finally, do not use X11 while logged in as root.
Even better, never log in as root, unless via ssh.
Instead just su - or use sudo to become root.

In order to get DRI working for users the easiest way is adding
a few extra lines to /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Section &quot;DRI&quot;
        Mode    0666
EndSection


As long as that is not embedded within any other sections it should work.
Now anyone can use DRI.
But you could make a group and use the group
to control access to DRI if you wanted.

The most difficult aspect of getting xorg working, for anyone but me,
is getting a correct /etc/X11/xorg.conf file installed that does what you want.
But if the server fails to start or has a problem
then you can check the startup log for that attempt:

$ less /var/log/Xorg.0.log

The WW may be interesting, but the EE indicate a problem.

Find a problem, fix it, try to start it again.
If using kdm then be sure to do

/etc/init.d/kdm stop
/etc/init.d/kdm start

If kdm fails to start the X server kdm still keeps on running.
I expect there is a good reason for this that I am completely unaware of.


As I was saying above, the most difficult aspect for me about xorg,
is that it's in some 300 spells that take a long time for me to update
and test each time a new version of xorg is released.
It can be a pain because requirements change
new sources are added,
old sources are removed,
some sources change names.
That purty much describes how I spent the first few days of this week.
In the next big grimoire update X11R7.3 will be included.
Should be okay for most every box to update to, except....
Boxes with the pre-compiled binary drivers provided by ATI can not do
that update.
I have no idea whether or not NVIDIA provided pre-compiled drivers
will work with it.
Boxes with the ATI pre-compiled drivers installed will not do the xorg update.



&gt;<i> I modified the links from /usr/lib64.old
</I>&gt;<i> to point /lib and got augur and cast to run.  Maybe I missed one and that's
</I>&gt;<i> why services isn't working.
</I>
/usr/lib64.old/ is a trashcan.
Do not modify anthing in /usr/lib64.old/

Here is how that works...

Let us say that ncurses updates.
The old version of ncurses is 5.6
It installed libraries such as:

/lib/libncurses.so
/lib/libncurses.so.5
/lib/libncurses.so.5.6

bash is also installed.
It dynamically links with
/lib/libncurses.so.5

So what happens if
/lib/libncurses.so.5
is removed from the filesystem
when ncurses 6.0 is installed?
Right, bash breaks!
Right, compilation breaks since neither
/bin/sh works nor /bin/bash
That would be very bad, yes?

Therefore, libncurses.so.5.6 is not removed.
Instead it is moved.
It is moved into /usr/lib.old/
or on x86_64 architecture it is moved into: /usr/lib64.old/
That way the new ncurses libraries:

/lib/libncurses.so
/lib/libncurses.so.6
/lib/libncurses.so.6.0

can be installed in /lib or /lib64 or where they correctly belong.
After the new ncurses is installed cast will do a fast check.
It will discover that bash and several other spells must be
re-compiled and linked to the new ncurses libraries.
Therefore, those spells go into the cast queue.
Eventually, all the spells that linked with the old ncurses libraries
have been recompiled and relinked.
At this point no installed ELF executables or ELF libraries require
the old ELF libraries installed by ncurses.
Therefore, cast safely removes those old libraries from
/usr/lib.old/ or /usr/lib64.old/

There are other ways this problem can be handled.
In the past there were other ways in which the sorcery tools handled it.
However, it is my estimate that the least probability of problems occurs
when stale libraries are moved from their permanent location to
/usr/lib.old/ and/or /usr/lib64.old/
That way there is no way that freshly compiled software
can link with the old libraries at compile time.
However, installed software can still link with the old libraries at runtime.
So in a way you might think of it like a retirement home for libraries.
They can beget no more off-spring, but you can
continue visiting with them until they eventually depart.
An absolutely morbid analogy, yes?

Generally, you will not have to do anything involving libraries in
/usr/lib64.old
And do not expect to keep anything in that directory.
cast will remove files from that directory without asking you any questions.
Any type of fixes involving files in that directory will break.

If you have files lingering in the /usr/lib.old/ or /usr/lib64.old/
directories for a long time then that is an indication that some
important spell that should be installed is probably not installed!

For example, and please do not do this....
One could execute.

# dispel --unsafe glibc

glibc would hang out in /usr/lib.old/ or /usr/lib64.old/
The box would not appear to break.
Software could still be run.
However, almost nothing could be compiled.
And the sorcery tools would be unable to repair that problem automatically.

The newer sorcery tools, implosion branch, are much better at making certain
that holes do not exist where spells should be installed.
Therefore, if ncurses or readline ended up in an uninstalled state
then the tools would eventually fix that as soon as spell is to be
cast that at some point in their requirement chains requires ncurses
and/or readline.

sorcery thaumaturgy by contrast only checks that a spell's direct
requirements are installed rather than checking all inherited requirements.

But do not worry about that for now.
In probably less than a week sorcery implosion will be standard on
Sorcerer boxes.

For now take a look at those libraries in /usr/lib64.old/

You might be able to find out where they came by asking

# augur history

and supplying the library name.

Make sure that the proper libraries that should provide those
libraries are installed.

In other words if sorcery thaumaturgy is not cleaning up so that no files remain
in the /usr/lib64.old/ directory then give it a hand by re-casting those spells
that should provide those libraries.

Remember that no fix involving symbolic links to files in /usr/lib64.old/
is a stable or permanent fix.
At best it is simply postponed trouble.
It may even cause failure of spells to compile that
would normally install those libraries and symbolic links.
In other words you may be solving one problem,
but causing an even more troublesome problem that
will occur later.


&gt;<i> I'll restart the box and try and update some of the core spells and see if
</I>&gt;<i> that fixes grep.
</I>

grep is a bit on the hopeless side these days.
At best update it to current.
I keep thinking that it will speed up again eventually.
Maybe someday it will.
However, I am not holding my breath.
sorcery implosion has very few invocations of grep in it.
It uses grep mainly only in those situations where grep
is without any doubt the most suitable choice.

Ah, back to getting xorg up and running.
If you have the space to install it and 8 hours
to let it compile then you may want to try installing KDE.
The K desktop environment is a great choice for intermediate level users.
It is not fast, it does consume much memory,
but it is good for many hours of amusement.
Since there are fewer KDE spells it is easier to tell if
you have the required components for KDE installed.

Gnome is a like KDE that jumped onto of a live pineapple.
Gnome is in so many source files that installing it could
be bewildering even with using sorcery.
The very earliest versions of sorcery rough draft
did not have a requirement system in them.
*chuckle*
But then gnome changed that.
Installing gnome without a requirement system is like
trying to swim out of the Bermuda triangle on an overcast night.

However, gnome has less C++ in it and therefore compiles faster
and tends to use less memory than KDE.
Difficult to say if the programs load much faster than KDE.
In both cases each ELF executable has many ELF library requirements.
But you can install gnome if you want it.
And besides many, if not most, of the programs one runs
on their X server use the same gtk+ libraries as are used by gnome.
I like to mentally deduct the libraries that I know will be resident most
of the time for my idea of the overall memory consumption for programs.
For example, there is practically no time when a booted box does not
have both the ncurses and readline libraries in RAM, because BASH uses
those libraries and almost always there is at least one bash shell running
or shell script running.
Ah but I am digressing.

The grimoire has many choices for desktop environments and window managers.
There are more than I can remember.
Some that come to mind are e16, xfce, icewm.
Basically, you have no shortage to select from.
Surely, you will find one that you like best.

Good luck with setting up X.
Hope it keeps running after the update to Xorg X11R7.3.  :)
