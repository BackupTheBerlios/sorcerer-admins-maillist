<PRE>That is a good point.
However, aside from sorcery logs in /etc/sorcery/log/
nothing else is logged in /etc.
Everything else is logged in /var/log

Consequently, I considered where the SA might notice
the sysinit and runlevel logs while trying to trouble shoot
an init problem when those logs do not exist in /var/log/
The SA would surely visit directories within /etc/rc.d/
and probably /etc/init.d/
/etc/init.d/log would clearly stand out.
And the SA would discover the log.
While not entirely intuitive it is at least along
the expected path of discovery.

If the directory was /etc/log
then the SA might not notice /etc/log,
might not realize it contains logs for sysinit and runlevels,
might expect that /etc/log was accidentally created.
In contrast, /etc/init.d/{dev,log} are obviously sysvinit related
due to those directories being located within /etc/init.d/

There is nothing about this in the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy.
Logging and/or redirecting output from sysinit and runlevels {2,3,4,5}
may not even be common place among distributions.
But since we want it
we are making our own rule and own exception
for how it is implemented.

Another possibility was a program similar to tee that
delays writing to a file until the file can be written.
Basically, it is a tee designed exactly for boot time logging
when filesystems will be mounted read only.
However, I decided against that method for several reasons.

First, having a log file on tmpfs is better than not having a log file
while /var/log remains read only.

Secondly, the log files could end up hidden.
If the program beings logging after /var is mounted,
but before /var/log is mounted
then the log files could end up hidden under /var/log

Third, there should be a directory for the device nodes
required for redirecting logging.
Since /dev is a ramfs virtual filesystem populated by udev
it is not guaranteed that any device except
/dev/null and /dev/console
before udev begins execution.
However, the logging device nodes are required
as soon as sysinit begins execution.
Therefore, /etc/init.d/dev seemed like a logical choice.

If instead /etc/dev/ and /etc/log/ are used
a SA may decide,
&quot;Those are obviously out of place.
# rm /etc/dev /etc/log&quot;
That would be unfortunately.
Besides, /etc/ is already seems a bit over-crowded,
due to the legacy rarely using subdirectories.


Yes, /etc/init.d/{dev,log} is probably not the best solution.
I tried some different choices including more complex rcS and prc
scripts to redirect logging only if the desired character devices
exist in /dev when the rcS and prc scripts begin execution.
Ultimately, I settled on using the most simple possible rcS and prc
scripts along with the above directories.

What I am curious to know is:
Is there something unusual about the /etc/init.d/
on anyone's boxes that precludes the possibility
of using /etc/init.d/{dev,log} ?

For example, I originally was going to use hard coded
defaults of /dev/tty11 and /dev/tty12 for scrolling the
sysinit and runlevel logs, respectively.
However, Mr. Malet informed me that
/dev/tty11 and /dev/tty12 were already tasked to scroll other logs.
Therefore, I took that into consideration.
That is why the the spell prompts for devices and
presents the default of /dev/tty9 and /dev/tty10
for the sysinit and runlevel logs, respectively.

So are we good to continue using /etc/init.d/{dev,log}
or should that be changed to /etc/sysvinit.d/{dev,log}
which I used in an earlier design?
