<PRE>SAs that frequently update may have already noticed that some of the
core spells recast almost daily.
This is to adjust the init scripts for the changes required
to enable Sorcerer boxes to boot in both the traditional method
and and a method that involves an entirely modular linux kernel
booting from an initramfs image.

The next release of Install/Rescue images will be very different.
First, they will have a complete installation of xorg and KDE.
Second, they will have a complete modular kernel.
Consequently, new boxes will be deployable entirely without
the skill check required to configure a linux kernel.
Lastly, the disk images will be much larger
than previous releases and also lack a companion sources CD.
However, the single architecture specific CDROM image
will still be burnable onto a single CDROM.

The changes have several benefits.
A faster transition from installation to full deployment of a box
is possible since the near 10 hours required to
compile linux + xorg + KDE will be unnecessary.
Second, a SA who wants to strip off the xorg and KDE
will require less than 5 minutes in Sorcerer's dispel menu
to accomplish the task.
Those who want the performance benefits
of a custom compiled kernel the linux spell
will still be available to savor the rapture
of make menuconfig on a linux kernel source.
Consequently, most of the benefits of the new Install/Rescue image
come at no additional cost to SAs already enamored
with the precise configure-ability of Sorcerer!

However, there are some costs to using the new images.
First, the download will be larger.
The new images download will be between 450M and 600M
The x86_64 images will definitely be larger than the ia32.
Secondly, larger images require longer to burn to disk.
And larger image burns have a high probability of encountering a burn error.
Definitely check a dd of burned image
verse the unburned iso9660 image or md5sum of the iso9660 image.
It is far better to discover that a burn error exists on the disk
prior to booting it and beginning installation.
Consequently, there is no transfer check in the Sorcerer installer anymore.

Currently, I have completed checks of the ia32 image,
but am not uploading it until I have completed the x86_64 image.
About 200 more spells require compilation to complete the x86_64 image.
No telling how long that will require using qemu's x86_64 emulation.
If I am able to acquire some CPU time on an actual x86_64 box
then I may be able to have the image ready before the new year.

One of the advantageous of using a completely modular linux kernel
is that Sorcerer will become for new SAs a plug 'n pray distro.
For some SAs the advantages of plug 'n pray on unknown hardware
may outweigh the cost of not using a precisely compiled and optimized
linux kernel.
A 5% to 10% efficiency loss is hardly noticeable on a modern box.
If you have an itch to try it now you can try a cast of linux-modular.
Be sure that the installed grimoire is 2007-347 or later so that you
obtain all the require bug fixes necessary to be able to boot from
an initramfs image.
And also execute # augur newer; augur update to be certain that
the required init scripts are compatibility with booting from initramfs.
Installations with customized /etc/initscript /etc/init.d/mount
and other customized files in /etc/init.d/ may not survive reboot
with a modular linux kernel.
Should a problem occur merely boot from an older,
but precisely configured linux kernel.

Many who have emailed me already know
that I have no fondness for using an initramfs during the boot of a box.
It introduces another level of complexity that SAs must master.
However, with the Sorcerer implementation the boot from initramfs
will be nearly identical to the boot from a native on disk root filesystem.
The main differences is that when booting from initramfs
the real root filesystem will be located and mounted
during the execution of /etc/init.d/mount during the sysinit.
Consequently, scripts that run in sysinit before /etc/init.d/mount can
execute from the initramfs
while scripts that run after will execute from the real root
filesystem that resides on a fixed disk.
This very simple design and integration with sysvinit
grants SAs the full benefits of using an initramfs for boot
without any additional learning required.

Some SAs might yet wonder what benefits can come from booting from
an initramfs as opposed to filesystem on the fixed disk.
Primarily, the root filesystem can reside on something other than a partition.
The root filesystem can be encrypted.
Or it can reside on a logical device.
It could be stripped across several disks.
It could be on a RAID.
Even if the root filesystem is something unusual
the kernel image and initramfs must reside on
/boot partition that is a real partition and preferably an ext2 partition.
If /boot exists on / and is stripped across several disk in a RAID or
logical device
then forget about lilo being able to load it.
Remember that if you try an exotic configuration.

Basically, the evolution of the linux kernel over the past few years
has increasingly favored the use of a modular kernel and the delegation
of what aught to be purely kernel tasks to user space programs such as
hotplug and udev.
In order to use some of the more rare configurations that are possible
an intiramfs image is required.
Consequently, now you will have all those options while still maintaining
the configure-ability that you have come to expect from Sorcerer.

Those of you itching to get started with an initramfs image are
probably wondering
exactly what is the catch to ensuring that the initramfs image is current.
Is there some sort of program that must be run to update it?
Actually, there is.
However, you never have to worry about it.
During shutdown a check is made to see if the initramfs image is current.
If it is not current a new initramfs image is generated and lilo is re-run
in order to ensure that the next boot is able to use the update initramfs image.
That implementation decision makes the boon of an initramfs image
entirely effortless for SAs.
However, keep in mind that on boxes with the initramfs spell installed
shutdown may require a minute longer than expected
in the event that the initramfs image requires updating.

Lastly, there is a noteworthy change involving hotplug and udev.
Basically all of the hotplug functionality is now delegated to udev.
Therefore, udev is started twice.
udev starts once during sysinit where it may be executing from an intiramfs.
It executes a cold-plug.
All disk and filesystem related devices have modules loaded as necessary
to match hardware that is detected as installed.
Then, during the execution of runlevels 1,2,3,4,5 udev is restarted.
This time it does another cold-plug event where it loads additional modules
for NICs and audio cards and other devices.
udevd remains present in memory, as a daemon, to respond to hotplug events.

This dual startup of udev allows for a more compact intiramfs image
that does not
contain modules for audio and networking that will probably not be
required for booting.
Since all modules for all available kernels are stored on a single
initramfs image:
/boot/initrf.gz
The, more precise inclusion of modules allows for a more concise
creation of an initramfs image.
Keep in mind if you run an initramfs image on a box with a very
limited amount of installed RAM
that is may be possible that the initramfs image becomes to large to load.
However, this problem should be extremely rare if it occurs at all
since most Sorcerer box have plenty of installed RAM for optimal performance.

In summary the transition to an installation using an entirely modular kernel
enables SAs that possess all of the potential but not yet the required
experience
to wield Sorcerer power.
If there was ever a test of SA skill required to deploy Sorcerer
then that test must be the make menuconfig on the linux kernel source.
Now we can welcome a new generation of Sorcerer SAs that will never have
to makemenu config on a linux source nor know the difference between
MTRR ACPID and framebuffers.

In the past we almost never see truly noob questions on the Sorcerer
email lists,
because anyone who deploys a Sorcerer box fully deserves the honors of being
a skilled POSIX system administrator.
However, in 2008 we should expect some very amusing questions on our email list.
As usual I expect our present community to be both kind and generous.

Example: How can I know what parameters I can pass to the kernel during boot?
Answer: Read /usr/src/linux/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
or if it is missing untar a linux kernel and read it from there.

Consequently, anything simple is about probably less than a one paragraph answer
and anything more complex can probably be answered in a FAQ or HOWTO from
the Linux Documentation Project at <A HREF="http://www.tldp.org">http://www.tldp.org</A>
Sorcerer is very complaint with standards.
Consequently, most generic documentation applies almost 100% to Sorcerer boxes.
Therefore, I expect that you experienced Sorcerer SAs will readily
assist the noobs
with their installation, update, and configuration questions.
If you deployed a Sorcerer box for a year or more
then you most certainly have the experienced required
to answer the next generation of noob questions.

A change has been made to Sorcerer so that init scripts that should
necessarily be run during boot and shutdown are now placed in
$SCRIPT_DIR/init.d.on/ instead of $SCRIPT_DIR/init.d/ in the grimoire.
Consequently, SAs will be less able to misconfigure their boxes.
This very minor change should enable less experienced Sorcerer SAs
to achieve successful deployment of Sorcerer with less potential for error.

Regarding a similar concern does anyone mind if all the optional
requirements in the grimoire
upon alsa-lib are changed to mandatory requirements upon alsa-lib?
Do we all use alsa by now?
Speak up if you still use OSS drivers only.

There are few problems if any with using the kernel's alsa OSS
compatibility, yes?
Although this is a very small issue t might make configuration of spells
a bit faster to not have to answer questions about the inclusion of
optional alsa.
The only place it might be a concern is on embedded systems.
However, such boxes probably do not have software installed
that supports alsa to begin with?

Lastly, I want to thank everyone who gave feedback, bug reports and
suggestions in 2007.
With as much as I do in order to maintain Sorcerer
I can become rather complacent about conjecturing positive change.
However, together we have forged a better, faster, more configurable
Sorcerer distribution.
Remember that discontentment is merely an impelling reason for positive change.
Consequently, the benefit of all criticism is evaluated foremost
rather than stereotyping feedback as either flame email or constructive.
Please keep that in mind so that you can be most positive and convincing
in the your recommendations so that the boons and banes of your
suggested changes
can be weighed accurately and a positive change can emerge
from the time invested in the conversation.

Sorcerer evolution over the last 5 years has been influenced greatly by
the expressed wants and requirements of Sorcerer SAs.
Although Sorcerer is well over half a decade old,
nothing about how Sorcerer works is indelibly engraved in stone.
The fact that Sorcerer design readily bends to the will of the senior level SA
may be the the least advertised benefit of the distribution.

Sorcerer's niche has been to scratch the itch that senior level SAs
obtain from deploying binary based distros.
Even as Sorcerer becomes more accessible to SAs with the potential,
but not yet the experience to be rated senior level,
Sorcerer will remain the in the niche of senior level SAs.
Therefore, Sorcerer will retain an emphasis on strong forward progress while
maintaining good backward compatibility so that Sorcerer boxes can
be update on a regular basis continually from time of deployment until
time of replacement.
That way senior level SAs can enjoy a 100% rating for maintaining
their deployed Sorcerer boxes while still gaining plenty of brownie points
for helping fellow co-workers, wearing other hats, and performing
the many other duties not generally expected of system administrators.
More simply put, you need not discloses to your bosses
how easy Sorcerer administration actually is.
Use that free time to train up.
The day that may be close at hand when companies like Cisco providing
many special purpose devices ranging from web server, DB, router, firewall,
and everything in between may make obsolete the entertaining tasks
of network and system administrator.
Even after our times has come to pass our abilities to learn and adapt will
grant us a foothold during the technological transition.
May we continue having fun until that change is upon us.

Happy New Year.
