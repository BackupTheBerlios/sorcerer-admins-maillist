<PRE>Thanks for the suggestion.  I guess I wasn't clear in my last e-mail, but
it's not Windows that I can't get to run, it's an X environment.  I've never
been able to get xorg to install correctly, let alone a window manager.
I've been in the process for the last week or so trying to get xorg
installed. I was working on this issue when I decided to update all of the
installed software to make sure I had everything current before moving
forward.

I was having some issues with grep earlier.  I think I had a hardware crash
earlier in the week that interupted a spell because yesterday when I tried
to cast anything, I got an error from grep saying a shared library didn't
exist.  For some reason all of the installed programs were looking in
/usr/lib64.old for the libraries.  I modified the links from /usr/lib64.old
to point /lib and got augur and cast to run.  Maybe I missed one and that's
why services isn't working.

I'll restart the box and try and update some of the core spells and see if
that fixes grep.

</I>&gt;<i> Seems very unusual.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If something incredibly strange happens, like above,
</I>&gt;<i> you may have to issue
</I>&gt;<i> pkill cast
</I>&gt;<i> Then, take a look at the process list using top and/or ps
</I>&gt;<i> and see if anything is still running that should not be.
</I>&gt;<i> Then, perhaps kill that also.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Generally, it can be dangerous to pkill cast because it
</I>&gt;<i> may be in the process of installing files.
</I>&gt;<i> Some files may be installed, all that is installed might not be tracked,
</I>&gt;<i> etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only thing about the services spell that might cause it to hang
</I>&gt;<i> appears
</I>&gt;<i> to be the grep statement in it.
</I>&gt;<i> grep runs incredibly slow on some boxes.
</I>&gt;<i> Not 13 hours type slow.
</I>&gt;<i> But I suppose it could if it encounter that sort of bug.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I replaced that grep with a sed statement
</I>&gt;<i> and it will go out in the next massive grimoire update.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for reporting the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> It probably is not distribution wide, I hope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for setting up a windows environment.
</I>&gt;<i> Cast wine and use kde together and that seems to work.
</I>&gt;<i> After installing wine run winecfg as the user who wants to
</I>&gt;<i> install and run win32 software.
</I>&gt;<i> That will allow setting up of the type of M$ compatible API
</I>&gt;<i> and the directories, and so forth.
</I>&gt;<i> Much software can now be run within wine.
</I>&gt;<i> wine updates more frequently than once per month.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main problem you may encounter is that z: or some other
</I>&gt;<i> letter may be mapped to your home directory.
</I>&gt;<i> Some malicious win32 software might bug, spy, trojan, virus,
</I>&gt;<i> delete, overwrite, encrypt, or corrupt files in your home directory.
</I>&gt;<i> Just because you run your win32 software within wine will
</I>&gt;<i> not protect your home directory against the ill effects of running
</I>&gt;<i> malware.
</I>&gt;<i> It could, perhaps, even install a custom plugin for firefox within your
</I>&gt;<i> home directory to spy on your web browsing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another option is to run an actually M$ operating system within qemu.
</I>&gt;<i> qemu's ia32 emulation is decent.
</I>&gt;<i> It's x86_64 emulation is slow.
</I>&gt;<i> But it is an option.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cast -c services
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Leech went and downloaded the source, Then my box seemed to compile the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dispelled spell: services
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is where it hangs.  I let it run all night last night to see if it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would finish, but I don't think it should be taking this long.  I have
</I>&gt;<i> tried
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to quit but the box appears to be locked.  I hit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'q', got nothing, I tried 'ctl-c' and nothing.  I don't want to hard
</I>&gt;<i> restart
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the box incase it will break something.  Any suggestions as to what I
</I>&gt;<i> need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to do?  Or what I did wrong?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
