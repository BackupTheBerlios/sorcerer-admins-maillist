The problem is not as bad as it might appear.
If you can not repair it directly, such as retrieving working
versions from /var/cache/archive/
then the next best solution is to use the pcre and grep
that is available on the Install/RESCUE disk.  :)

For something that small you need not do a precise full transfer,
but just grab the files from the I/R that you require and for the moment
place them, if libraries, in /usr/local/lib/
Then, run ldconfig
Once pcre and grep are cast again
then you can go ahead and safely remove the libraries
that you temporarily placed in /usr/local/lib/

Hmm.... was that.... oh right I just answered that email a moment ago.
Once the installed glibc is fixed then gcc-v3.3 will probably compile.
However,....
If the currently installed glibc is not properly tracked by sorcery
and/or there is cruft from other non tracked glibc versions installed
then the cast of glibc could fail.

You may want to verify that the installed glibc is tracked by comparing
what is in /lib and /lib64 with what is reported by
# augur install glibc

Additionally, you should check that there are no other glibc libraries of
other versions installed in /lib and /lib64 that are not listed in the glibc
install log.

glibc libraries are fairly easy to identify because they follow the same naming
pattern as those libraries listed in # augur install glibc

/lib/libform.so.5.6

For example the above library is not a glibc installed library.
It is from ncurses.
But if I did not know that I could ask sorcery.

# augur from /lib/libform.so.5.6
ncurses:/lib/libform.so.5.6
ncurses:/usr/lib/libform.so.5.6

And it tells me that it is from ncurses.

I recommend the order of fixing be pcre, grep, glibc, gcc-v3.3
Naturally, the most difficult component to fix is glibc.
If you have an archive file for glibc it may be okay to use that
instead of re-compiling glibc, likewise the glibc provided on the
Install/Rescue disk can also be used.
However, you have practically no chance of being able to merely
# tar -xf /var/cache/archive/glibc-archive....
When it tries to overwrite some of the files, some of the files will
probably fail to be overwitten, end up with a size of zero, and
being important library files at that cause the box to break for
up to 1.5 minutes until immune spots the break and attempts
to repair it using /lib.old and /lib64.old

It is possible to replace a running glibc library on a box.
But unless you are certain you know how to do it
then it is best to boot from the I/R and then mount the
hard disk filesytem and fix it that way.
Of course, if that is not done correctly then the box may fail to reboot.
# cast -c glibc
is probably best as long as the install log and id log for glibc is correct
and there are no other untracked glibc libraries installed.
But if you end up fixing it while booted from the I/R then remember
that the last step to do is...

# ldconfig -r /media/root

That assumes that the real filesystem is located at /media/root
It is important that the /media/root/ld.so.cache is updated after
changing around the glibc libraries and before rebooting the box.
It would be very easy for anyone to forget to do that.

Hopefully, the box will be entirely in good working order after you
make those fixes.
If not then there is always the other way around.  :)

The other way around is this...
but of course it takes a long time.
It is what one might do if there is no time when
one can really take the box down for extreme repairs.

Copy an I/R to a directory on the hard disk.
Set it up appropriately.
chroot into it.
cast all the software on it that is installed on the box.
Transfer over the appropriate configuration files.
Then finally, after the new chroot image is completely built
you can switch it with the main filesystem.
This can be done without rebooting, if you are me.  :)
Otherwise, I recommend that you boot from the I/R to do the switch.
That is because the moment you moved /lib or /lib64 to
/old/
nothing would work after that unless you export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
and gave very precise commands prefixed with the correct path to
what you want to use for ld.so

For example:

# mv /lib /old/
## Bad break occurs right here, hope you shut off immune before you did this.
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&quot;/old/lib&quot;
# /old/lib/ld-linux.so.2 /bin/mv /new/lib /

That way mv could be executed and move the new /lib from /new/lib to /

It is probably easier to just reboot from the I/R then
mount the hard disk filesystem and then move the directories around.
But, if the box can't come down.  :)  Then, a SA has to do the directory
switching live.

I always encourage SAs to directly solve the problem at hand rather
than doing a re-install or an advanced chrooted rebuild.
Even the problems that seem really big at first are usually fixable
by executing 3 to 5 commands correctly.
And thus even difficult problems seem very trivial after they are fixed.
Plus the SA learns those tricks that in the future make what they do
seem effortless.

If you have a moment to keep reading....
The other day I bugged up some sorcery
and ended up exploding a grimoire onto /
Can you imagine all those files and directories right within /
I was thinking to myself, oh this will take a moment to clean up.
So first I make a /trash directory.
Of course I did not want to accidentally rm anything important.
Then, I started moving everything into /trash,
but sort of by accident I moved both /bin /sbin /lib into /trash also.
That caused an immediate bad break.
Did I brick my shorts or cuss?
Nah.
I just exported LD_LIBRARY_PATH executed the /trash/bin/mv command
and moved those important directories back out of /trash

Point is that through experience you will learn the tricks to recovery quickly
from even some of the worst mistakes and you will have experience to
choose cautious courses of actions such as using an initial trash directory
when disposing of files and directories in dangerous areas or as root.

But at times I am tempted to remember a certain Bob that executed a
rm -rf something* in his home directory and accidentally put a space
between something and the *
He blew away everything in his home directory.
And that is why some of us are SAs, and some of us are users.
*chuckle*
But I did sort of feel sorry for him, because at the time the very limited
backups were only done using tapes of mission critical servers and not of
user's home directories.
Maybe if there was a way to undelete files on Solaris?
But at the time I did not know.
I guess I was a bit surprised that he did not have any of his own
personal backups.
But then again the box was on a closed network.
Oh well.

Anyway, no doubt you will be able to repair those, learn a bit in the process.
But if it requires too much attention you can always do a chrooted rebuild,
followed by a switch while booted from the I/R
All that would take is a bit of disk space.
And if you do, do the chrooted rebuild, it is easier to mount --bind
/new/proc to /proc
and same for sys and dev and so forth...
--binds can be removed more easily.
And also make sure that lsof is installed.
That way when you are done you can check to see if any programs
are left running within the previous chroot
# lsof | grep /new
Or in your case
# lsof | sed -n &quot;\,/new,p&quot;
*chuckle*

If you have any trouble unbinding /new/sys /new/proc /new/dev,
or most likely only /new/dev, then do a lsof check
# lsof | sed -n &quot;\,/new/dev/,p&quot;

After the box is all fixed you may want to run
# augur alien | tee /tmp/aliens.txt
# augur md5sum

Some of the aliens may be files or directories that you want to remove.
Likewise the md5sum check will put into the cast queue spells that have
files that should be installed and are missing or files that are installed,
but do not have the same md5sum as when installed.
Those files may have been modified without authorization or have
simply corrupted on disk or have been corrupted due to a filesystem error.

I hope that grants you some options for repairing the box that best suit
your constraints for effort, time, downtime, etc...
I do enjoy the ease of repairing a Sorcerer box by using either
archives or files from the Install/Rescue disk.
No databases to worry about, no complexity, everything fixable
usually with using commands such as export cp and tar.
Easier than putting together a 100 piece puzzle.
