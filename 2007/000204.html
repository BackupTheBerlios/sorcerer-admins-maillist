<PRE>Hi Decker,

By the way , regarding...

&quot;jacobsen something dot net has stopped getting grimoire updates from
2007-231 ... (today is 2007-237)&quot; (but is is jakobsen - with a k ;) )

This is my sourcecache server (jakobsen.homelinux.com)  - and I do not
allow this to be updated automatically .. Sorry.

This is done &quot;manually&quot; - where by I mean, I start the update script
manually - and it will most likely never be otherways. And some days I
might even forget to run the update script (or do not have the time
for executing it) - sorry I'm human too. But thanks for the
information - but if the machine is offline - I would much more like
to know ;)

Because it has happend that the router was in error - so it was
powered on - but the http port from outside - was closed by the
firewall. So in this case it would have been nice to know ;)

The grimoire on my machine could be corrupted - I do not know
(eventhough I do not think so) - but if so - I can not do anything
about it - right now. (I started the update about 7 hours ago - so
perhaps it is still serving a corrupted grimoire) - but if so I can
only remove the grimoire in about 8-9 hours from now. And therefore it
will not matter - as the day is almost gone (11 hours left) - and
thereafter you'll fetch the new grimoire.

Normally I run the update script - around at 4 or 5 Zulu-time - this
is done to leave time for your own automatic update - to fetch your
versions of the grimoire - so that you yourself can fetch a hopefully
correct grimoire.

Even more I preserve the right to flush the source cache on my server
- when I want - not that it ever has happend (on purpose). But it has
happend by error ;) (a modification to a script that I made - had some
hard consequences - in that it deleted my source cache)

But the sourcecache server is my offer - not something I'm paid for -
if this seems to be a problem - I can remove the caching of sources
all together (or rather not share them out).
But do please drop me a line - if you want it - or not - because there
is no reason that I share this, if the community do not want to use
it.

But sofar there seems to be some machines who use it - and therefore I
plan to keep the source cache server online.  I would not right now
publish the ip-address of machines who has downloaded from it, to this
mailing list - but the maintainers of our distro - can get it - if
they want to - as every connection to the machine is logged, and I
will gladly look into the log file for you - if you tell me which
connection you use, then I can say what you have downloaded from me  -
and when. The reason for this attitude is that there is machines
located at places (as seen from the log file) where I think they do
not want there servers listed on a public mailing list.

By the way: If others wants to share it out - it is about 7 GB of data
for all sources (if one only counts the current versions - but it
amounts to about 50 GB data on the harddrive per year). The internet
upload usage - is if I remember it correctly is about 1-3 GB a month.
