<PRE>I have 4 boxes deployed with transparent decompression.
cast supports it if:

1. fuse is installed
2. fuse.gunzip is installed
3. reduce feature is enabled
4. Sufficiently, larger enough /tmpfs mounted on /dev/shm
    providing POSIX SHM.
5. fuse.gunzip is actively providing the overlay for /usr
   when a spell is cast
6. Then, the files reduced will depend upon
    what function is used to identify which files should be compressed.
7. The default is not to reduce files that are not fragmented.

It is entirely possible that it can be active and have do nothing.
If /dev/shm is entirely filled because it is smaller than 96M
then fuse.gunzip may cause some very spectacular
malfunctions when reading files.

A sure way to see if it active is to:

# ls -lah /dev/shm
-rw-------  1 root root  11K Feb  2 02:50 .10864.1169611210.349557.773.0.fguz
-rw-------  1 root root 109K Feb  2 04:32 .110796.1170356374.362727.773.0.fguz
-rw-------  1 root root  12K Feb  2 02:51 .11348.1166657081.334546.773.0.fguz
-rw-------  1 root root 112K Feb  2 00:58 .114252.1168607572.311994.773.0.fguz

If it is working then files such as those above with the
leading dot and the extention of .fguz will be present.
Chances are it is not working if you saw no changes
in the disk free space as reported by df -a

Problems with cast glibc are usually do to either:
1. Untracked glibc library files exist in /lib or /lib64
2. The install log for the currently installed glibc is incorrect.

Unlike other spells cast glibc can malfunction
spectacularly if the above 2 conditions exist.
Generally, the combination of the library cache
along with sorcery's immune system should not
allow for a box to break so bad that bash can not be run.
That would be a problem that could require an I/R to fix
when no root login shell is currently open when it happens.

Here is a simple tests you can try to verify transparent
decompression works, after you verify the tmpfs on
/dev/shm is at least 128M.  :)

reduce /usr/bin/eject
/usr/bin/eject --help
A .fguz file for /usr/bin/eject will appear in /dev/shm
The name of it will not be eject, of course.
The name shows information that is used to identify the file
and ensure that the cached result presented transparently
matches for /usr/bin/eject.
Therefore, if /usr/bin/eject was modified, such as a new one
was installed by cast eject, then the old cached results would
not be used by mistake instead of providing transparent
decompression for the newly installed /usr/bin/eject

Transparent decompression for /usr is rather dramatic
after a box has time to get used to it.
Savings upwards of 2/3rds can be achieved
while providing faster than normal file access.
It's like a win/win scenario.

The only thing that transparent decompression takes a big hit for
is using reduced files for ELF libraries when ldconfig is executed.
Consequently, the default method for selecting files to reduce is
to omit the reduction of ELF libraries installed in /usr/lib and /usr/lib64
I will skip the technical explanation why this is so.

Using fuse.gunzip on my new versions testing box practically means
that I never have to uninstall software in order to regain space.
I originally made the / partition smaller than what the box's current task,
because I expected to deploy it as a workstation instead.

It is a much better solution than backup, re-installation,
and re-deployment of a box if one wants to stretch out
a few more years out of it.
You can even remove the mount --binds from /etc
that mount for example /var/opt as /opt.  :)

In my next release of fuse.gunzip I will probably make it
so that fuse.gunzip automatically limits the cache size
to 3/4th the size of the tmpfs mounted on /dev/shm in
order to avoid a potential problem with /dev/shm
becoming full on boxes with little RAM installed.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and I decided to recast everything (for the fun!)  so I done a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it started fine but once again when glibc comes into play it's dramatic !
</I>&gt;<i> this morning when I came back I had most of my application killed and

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> first I had ncurses dispelled and then no new bash available hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> tar was still working and I could untar it from /var/cache/archive

</I>&gt;<i> problem same solution....
</I>&gt;<i> and well after that I could launch some xterm again and tried a su....
</I>&gt;<i> shadow was missing! same problem same solution
</I>&gt;<i> after that some cast were failing.... looking compile log I found that
</I>&gt;<i> there was include problem... looking /usr/X11R6 directory.... I had bin

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> after that everything gone fine
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it's not the first time that I have this problem... and most of the time

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thinks that for packages that support DESTDIR install it would be

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> $ldd $(which tar)
</I>&gt;<i>         linux-gate.so.1 =&gt;  (0xffffe000)
</I>&gt;<i>         librt.so.1 =&gt; /lib/librt.so.1 (0xb7eca000)
</I>&gt;<i>         libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6 (0xb7db8000)
</I>&gt;<i>         libpthread.so.0 =&gt; /lib/libpthread.so.0 (0xb7da6000)
</I>&gt;<i>         /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb7eef000)

</I>&gt;<i>         /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb7f69000)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> so those 2 utils required to dispell and to install only require
