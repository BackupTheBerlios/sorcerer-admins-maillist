</I>
There are 2 types of slow when it comes to Sorcerer.
There is the type of slow where a SA must sit and watch
and the type of slow where a SA can leave and go do other things.
Before compilation starts a SA must wait and watch to
see if any questions are asked about optionals for spells.
However, after compilation begins the SA can quit scry
log out, and work on other tasks.
Therefore, compilation slowness does not waste SA time.
However, waiting to be asked questions about optionals
on spells before compilation does waste SA time.
That is why I want that to run faster
even faster than it does currently.


&gt;<i> So what it's doing when generating index, its checking requirement and doing
</I>&gt;<i> some index from requirement (some sort of pre-calc?) and thats why it would
</I>&gt;<i> slow index generation?
</I>
It does not do that.
I wish it could.
At one time it did.
But not only was it slow,
but it ment that re-indexing
had to be done when a SA's
selection of optionals had been received.
In other words, before the SA says X does optionally require Y
either the index had to assume it did or assume it did not.
That is why that code was removed from indexing.

What indexing does is separate information in spells into a form
that can be processed faster later when requirement chains of
for spells are to be calculated.
All the absolute requirements for a spell are put in a file.
All the optional requirements for a spell are put into a file.
That way the file content can be accessed with a &lt;
And that is faster than sourcing in the spell and then
doing some sort of echo involving ${REQ[]}

Indexing also produces a list of how spells should be ordered.
The order of spells assumes that any optional requirement that
can be on is on.
That assumption allows for the generation of an ordered list of
all spells in the grimoire that will be valid no matter which optionals
for spells are selected as on or off.

And of course indexing builds some other important list such as
files and directories that should be protected and excluded,
and also the URL mirrors that sources define and it creates
lists of spells by their categories and attributes.
Everything indexing does generally makes whatever will happen
later happen much faster than it would without an index.
It is not unlike the index of a book.
Without the grimoire index in several instances the entire grimoire
would have to be executed or grepped in order to locate information.

The cost of generating the index is paid back completely almost
immediately because the speed gain for other operations involving
one or more spells is that much faster.


&gt;<i> I like current speedy index generation (compared when it was so damn slow),
</I>&gt;<i> but can those parts move to eg. when cast is about to run first time?
</I>
They do....
When immune is executed at boot
neither the grimoire is merged nor is an index generated.
Jan and some other SAs mentioned it expedited the booting
process on notebooks.

However, the execution of augur, cast, leech, dispel, sorcery
and so forth will cause a merge and index if it does not exist.
The high probability that the index or merged grimoire will be used
is the reason why invocation of those 5 tools begin with a check to
see if the merged grimoire and index are available.
It is faster to do that check merely once when any of those tools
are invoked as opposed to doing a check every time before the
index or merged grimoire is accessed.


&gt;<i> Somehow i feel why Gentoo uses global USE-flag, it has beneficts that those
</I>&gt;<i> optional parts are set on globally.
</I>
Perhaps.
But with Sorcerer I decided to allow
precise optional selection for each spell.
For example...
aumix has a gtk+ interface.
I do not like using the gtk+ interface for aumix.
Therefore, I prefer being able to select gtk+ as off for aumix.
If I must set gtk+ as globally on or globally off as an optional
then I would require for my convenience either 3 spells such as:
aumix; aumix-console; aumix-gtk+
or a customized aumix spell to compile while sending the
--without-gtk configure paramter.


&gt;<i> Anyway, i think we are missing one feature that might be usefull. Eg. if you
</I>&gt;<i> cast x.org and you have casted earlier spells which has some libx11, etc,
</I>&gt;<i> optional part, so i would like to have easy way to re-cast all installed
</I>&gt;<i> spells which have libx11 as optional part, so it would ask if you want to
</I>&gt;<i> re-cast this spell with libx11 on.
</I>
I do not understand the above request.
Oh, maybe I do.
You could try something like

# cast -r -c $(
( cd  /etc/sorcery/log/opt.off
  grep -lx libX11 *
  augur installed
) | sort | uniq -d )

The above command would allow for each spell that has an
optional requirement on libX11 that was previously selected as off
to be reconfigured and recompiled if that spell is still installed.

What would you that functionality if it was added to augur?


&gt;<i> Also whats most easiest way to dispell spells, example if you want to
</I>&gt;<i> dispell x.org, are we missing some sort of depency check here, so if i to
</I>&gt;<i> dispell xorg, should it also be able to dispell all other spells which
</I>&gt;<i> requires xorg, some sort of reverse check?
</I>
Probably no spells require xorg
xorg is merely a profile spell.
Spells might require spells such as libX11
Many spells require xproto.
But the very root would probably be X11R6-symlinks
Having identified the root of that tree of spells you wish to eliminate
you could issue a command such as:

# dispel X11R6-symlinks $( augur iron X11R6-symlinks )

And a few moments later the box is nothing but console only spells and
libraries.

Another, but perhaps less precise method might be to try to eliminate
installed spells by their attribute

# dispel $( augur attribute x11 )

But that may not be as effective as the previous command.
That is because spells may be installed that should have the x11
attribute, but do not have the x11 attribute.

If you were wondering how I identified the root spell for
all spells requiring xorg installed libraries I looked at:

# augur arof libX11
libgpg-error
libpthread-stubs
pkgconfig
zlib
libgcrypt
X11R6-symlinks
bigreqsproto
inputproto
kbproto
xcb-proto
xcmiscproto
xextproto
xf86bigfontproto
xproto
xtrans
libXau
libXdmcp
libxml2
libxslt
libxcb

X11R6-symlinks is the highest spell on the list that obviously still belongs
with the xorg group of spells.

compare that to # augur arof for any other spell that requires x11 libraries
and you will see that there is a similarity in the output of # augur arof.
Spells in that list are ordered so that spells that are required
come before those spells which require them.
Or you can think of it as an upside down tree with the
roots growing at the top instead of the bottom.

The limit of what a SA wants to do is unimaginable,
but the method to accomplish those tasks I imagine
to usually require merely a few command lines.

I generally do not create new augur commands for tasks
that can be completed as easily as those I typed above.
There would be practically no end to it if I did.

But with a good explanation of why the command is needed
and what it is called then I sometimes do include it.
For example, # augur newer_ia was a SA requested command
But newer_ia requires more than 10 lines of code.
It would be inconvenient to type it on a command line.
