<PRE>I have an old Pentium III with Sorcerer installed which I update somewhat 
infrequently because it's a slow computer.
But recently I've been getting some X crashes which seem to leave the
onboard i810 graphics unable to be reset:

ipeir: 0 iphdr: 50c00004
LP ring tail: 7648 head: 6730 len: f001 start 780000
eir: 0 esr: 0 emr: 3d
instdone: ff3a instpm: 0
memmode: 4 instps: 810
hwstam: 9ac7 ier: 0 imr: 9ac7 iir: 0

Fatal server error:
Active ring not flushed



So I thought I would 'augur sync' and upgrade X:
But after upgrading my installed grimoires I got all these errors
saying that root directories couldn't be removed:
