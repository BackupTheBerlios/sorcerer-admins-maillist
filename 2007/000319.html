<PRE>Recently, I was testing the boot speed of
parallelized init script execution at runlevel 4.
My conclusion of course was,
&quot;Yes, that is very fast!&quot;

However, is efficient computing over when booting has completed?
After booting completes the computer is probably mostly idle
while awaiting someone to login and
to begin execution of programs such as firefox.
However, if the norm for the workstation is for someone to login
and begin execution of programs within 5 minutes after boot
then should not the computer anticipate that and begin
loading files into memory before they are needed?
Seems like a simple task for a computer to accomplish, yes?

Take firefox for example.
It reads many files when it starts up.
Consequently, starting firefox may require 10 or more seconds
if the computer recently finished booting.
However, if firefox was previously loaded and exited
then the files may still be in the kernel cache.
If firefox's files are cached then starting firefox may require merely 1 second.
1 second is better than 10, yes?
By that realization I decided that
computers should anticipate the files that will be read
and it should load the contents of those files into RAM before they are needed,
because a computer with pre-cached files can start programs faster.

After discarding several potential implementations I created
an implementation that is efficient, eloquent, and simple and
I call it bootblaze.
I added it to the sorcery tools along with an optional init script.
Merely select the bootblaze init script as on for it to run during boot.

The way bootblaze works is simple.
When the box is booted bootblaze memorizes the files
that are opened during the first five minutes of execution.
It memorizes executables, ELF libraries, and data files.
It adds those to a list /etc/bootblaze.conf
Until /etc/bootblaze.conf is populated no pre-caching of files during
boot is possible.
However, once /etc/bootblaze.conf exists the contents of those files,
listed in /etc/bootblaze.conf, are read into RAM by bootblaze during boot.
Then, when a program tries to read one of the pre-cached files the contents
can be quickly read from RAM instead of wasting any CPU cycles on waiting
for the fixed disk to read the file.

Configuration is easier than making an ACL.
Verify /etc/init.d/bootblaze exists and is mode 0700
Verify that /etc/bootblaze.conf does not exist.
Reboot.
Login and execute all the programs typically running within 5 minutes
of booting.
Configuration is complete!

To change the configuration of bootblaze simply
remove /etc/bootblaze.conf and repeat the steps in the above paragraph.
If /etc/bootblaze.conf is more than 2 days old during boot
then bootblaze will add to /etc/bootblaze.conf
files that are read within the first 5 minutes of booting.
That way if installed software has been updated
and different files are being loaded during boot
then bootblaze will recognize and adapt to the change.
It is an automatic reconfiguration.
Without need for further elaboration
bootblaze uses an intelligent method
to determine what files to keep in
/etc/bootblaze.conf and what files to dismiss.

One important limitation is that bootblaze will not enter into
/etc/bootblaze.conf files that exist in /home directories.
Consider it a privacy concern that bootblaze only
pays attention to files read in within in /bin /etc /usr /sbin

Thanks for taking the time to learn about this new sorcery functionality.
The last obvious question is probably
what boxes should become bootblaze enabled?

Many of us keep both our workstations running all the time
and reboot only after installing a new kernel.
Keeping computers constantly on is healthier for fixed disks, power
supplies and fans.
Frequent powering down and powering up of computers,
even once per day,
can cause fixed disks, power supplies, and fans to fail prematurely.
Computers left on all the time will rarely benefit from bootblaze.
However there is no significant cost for using bootblaze other than
selecting it as on.

Conversely, off time is a norm for notebooks.
Therefore, notebooks should benefit for using bootblaze.

sorcery with bootblaze will arrive sometime this week.
This informational update email was sent a few days in advance
to inform SAs of the new functionality to avoid being caught unaware
when granted the option of having /etc/init.d/bootblaze run during boot.


For those more interested in a new I/R set...
Unfortunately, next weekend may be as soon as possible.
Do not hold your breath.
It is not a promise.
I loathe committing the effort to have some silly mistake render them unsuable.
Anyone who requires a change to the I/Rs send me a message this week.

Already, they will have kernels configured very differently than the
previous release
and should work for even USB CDROMs without the trouble of shelling
to load additional modules, run busybox mdev, and manually create the
/dev/cdrom symbolic link.
Sorry for the inconveniences it has already caused.
