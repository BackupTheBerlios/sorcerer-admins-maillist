At first glance it sounds like a fantastic idea,
until it overwrites /etc/fstab with a blank or perhaps other
files that were installed and purposefully modified.

That mistake with having checksums for files in /usr/src/linux
that should not have been is has a one in an incalculably large
number chance of occurring again.

But I like your thinking all the same.
Even the menu driven installer is a bit demanding.

I received at least one report of something using the device mapper
to set up all except the root and boot partitions.
The advantages I doubt outweigh the performance
cost of properly sized partitions.
However, one can use the device mapper dcrypt
to set up an encrypted filesytem.
Therefore, one could if they wanted have an encrypted
home partition that one must supply a password to mount?
But the menu driven installer does not support
the device mapper yet, but once you have it configured
the menu driven installer can detect and present the block
devices created in /dev/mapper.
