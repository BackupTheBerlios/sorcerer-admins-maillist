<PRE>what was great with previous design of network is that there was no need 
to merge all script requiring complex knowledge of how networks had to 
be brought up....
you have ethernet? fill the required fields in top of the template and 
that's it....
you have pppoe? do the same.....
it was easy to add an interface
now it's complex.... you have to know what part of the scripts to merge 
into a single script that brings everything up...
current design isn't as flexible as previous one.....
maybe we should add &quot;network&quot; templates
ie you have 2 networks home and office
/etc/networks.d/home
/etc/networks.d/office

/etc/networks.d/networks/ contain all the scripts for networking

/etc/networks.d/home :
start() {
     /etc/networks.d/networks/eth0-fixed  &amp;&amp;
     /etc/networks.d/networks/pppoe-home
}
stop() {
    /etc/networks.d/networks/pppoe-home stop
    /etc/networks.d/networks/eth0-fixed stop
}

/etc/networks.d/office :
start() {
     /etc/networks.d/networks/eth0-dhcp start
     /etc/networks.d/networks/eth1-dhcp start
}
stop() {
    /etc/networks.d/networks/eth1-dhcp stop
    /etc/networks.d/networks/eth0-dhcp stop
}

doing this will make notice the user that he have to write what to 
brings up for what
but this add a new layer in networking what I don't like

maybe the really best is to do nothing by defaut in /etc/init.d/networks 
and let the user customize...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well I don't think so, anyway when you install sorcerer you read the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> readme and well it's not difficult to understand that each directory in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d represent a network and each script in that network is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tried until one success
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was not obvious to me and I designed it and wrote the readme file.
</I>&gt;<i> each file directly in /etc/networks.d/
</I>&gt;<i> represents either a network or networks.
</I>&gt;<i> Each file is executed with start on start and stop on stop.
</I>&gt;<i> It should return 0 if successful 1 if not successful.
</I>&gt;<i> There is need for a nest of subdirectories in /etc/networks.d/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes templates can not merely be cat together.
</I>&gt;<i> Having a template raise more than one network
</I>&gt;<i> can require significant modification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, let us say that I redo it.
</I>&gt;<i> Any directory, except the example directory
</I>&gt;<i> under /etc/networks.d/ becomes a directory that
</I>&gt;<i> represents a group of networks to be started and stopped together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For this example let
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d/0_home/eth0
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d/0_home/pppoe
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d/1_office/dhcp
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d/1_office/wlan0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Something like the above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The box is at home
</I>&gt;<i> The box is booted.
</I>&gt;<i> The ISP is flaking.
</I>&gt;<i> However, eth0 comes up fine.
</I>&gt;<i> Should the networks in /etc/networks.d/1_office also be raised or not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The box is at the office.
</I>&gt;<i> It is booted.
</I>&gt;<i> It starts with /etc/networks.d/0_home/eth0
</I>&gt;<i> success even though the box is at home.
</I>&gt;<i> The SA did not modify the script correctly to check DNS.
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d/0_home/pppoe fails
</I>&gt;<i> Does /etc/init.d/networks try to raise networks in
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d/office ?
</I>&gt;<i> It already raised one network in /etc/networks.d/0_home.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I stated before.
</I>&gt;<i> There is far too much ambiguity in what is proper to be done
</I>&gt;<i> with multiple networks being raised from modified templates
</I>&gt;<i> stored in a directory that represents a location.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now let us say there are just these two
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d/0_home
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d/1_office
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/networks does not care if one or more networks is raised
</I>&gt;<i> by 0_home or 1_office.
</I>&gt;<i> All it cares about is the exit value when run.
</I>&gt;<i> So it first runs 0_home
</I>&gt;<i> does it exit 0?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.  no need to run 1_office.
</I>&gt;<i> No, time to run 1_office
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is simple.
</I>&gt;<i> That is clear.
</I>&gt;<i> This way the SA can define whether or not if one only one network
</I>&gt;<i> is raised in 0_home if that constitutes a success or a failure.
</I>&gt;<i> For example eth0 might be possible to establish at both home and office.
</I>&gt;<i> However, home is not home unless pppoe also raises.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, the SA can modify the template so that a failure of pppoe
</I>&gt;<i> exits 1 and therefore 1_office receives a chance at being raised.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all networks have to be considered independant and should be tried to get up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if fact the current method is by far less usefull than the previous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All networks are not independent.
</I>&gt;<i> They may depend upon location.
</I>&gt;<i> pppoe may depend on eth0 being raised first.
</I>&gt;<i> pppoe may create and use a virtual device by virtual device
</I>&gt;<i> runs through the actual hardware device eth0, yes?
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise if one us using many wlan wireless networks
</I>&gt;<i> then the network to connect to probably depends on
</I>&gt;<i> where the box happens to be.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, if connecting to one fails
</I>&gt;<i> then the attempt of another
</I>&gt;<i> depends on the first attempt failing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/network one....  because you can't have several network up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and catenate template isn't a solution... what if I want to restart my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pppoe without dropping my eth0?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is an excellent point.
</I>&gt;<i> And it is not something that is addressed by this design.
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/networks is supposed to run at startup and shutdown.
</I>&gt;<i> It connects to all the networks it is supposed to and disconnects
</I>&gt;<i> from all the networks it is supposed to.
</I>&gt;<i> That is what it is designed to do.
</I>&gt;<i> It is not designed to be invoked:
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/networks stop pppoe
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/networks start pppoe
</I>&gt;<i> But it would have to be in order to satisfy your request.
</I>&gt;<i> Because an invocation of /etc/init.d/networks stop
</I>&gt;<i> would attempt to drop all your connected networks
</I>&gt;<i> irregardless of whether they are defined as:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d/0
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d/1
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d/0/a
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d/0/b
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d/1/a
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d/1/b
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You would require something more like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/networks stop 0/a
</I>&gt;<i> in order to specify the precise network to be disconnected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want that then please make and test the
</I>&gt;<i> changes to networks in the svn grimoire.
</I>&gt;<i> Please maintain backward compatibility
</I>&gt;<i> so that after the spell updates boxes continue
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to start their networks upon boot as they
</I>&gt;<i> are currently defined by files directly within /etc/networks.d/
</I>&gt;<i> Please exclude /etc/networks.d/templates/ directory
</I>&gt;<i> Please only invoke executables located in /sbin and /bin
</I>&gt;<i> Do not invoke /usr/bin/find, for example.
</I>&gt;<i> Please try to keep it simple.
</I>&gt;<i> The way /etc/init.d/networks is now is very easy for me to see
</I>&gt;<i> at a glance what it does and to be able to modify it.
</I>&gt;<i> The next person would appreciate if it could remain equally as easy to follow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck with the modifications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maybe the best is to provide templates to copy to /etc/init.d....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might be a bit difficult to have them execute in proper order
</I>&gt;<i> if they existed in /etc/init.d/
</I>&gt;<i> Modified templates are fine within /etc/networks.d/
</I>&gt;<i> The control for what should execute in /etc/networks.d/
</I>&gt;<i> should be supplied by /etc/init.d/networks
</I>&gt;<i> If it were easier the other way around I would have kept
</I>&gt;<i> it the way it was before when such things as
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/eth0
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/network
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/ppp0
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/init.d/dhcpcd
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and such existed in the /etc/init.d/ directory
</I>&gt;<i> Tried it, ran with it, discard it.
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/networks.d/ is better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no, I created the spell recently after getting my ipv6 tunnel and beeing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unable to use ifconfig to set ip
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> created the iproute2 spell?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    VERSION=(                 &quot;2.6.19-061214&quot; &quot;2.6.18-061002&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;2.6.16-060323&quot; &quot;2.6.15-060110&quot; &quot;2.6.15-060110&quot; &quot;2.6.14-051107&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;051007&quot; )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It has many old versions in the version array.
</I>&gt;<i> Am I misunderstanding?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
oups sorry I confused with a package that provide ping6 and 
traceroute6..... mea culpa

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well net-tools lack lot of ipv6 features in fact.... all people I asked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> told me to drop it....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay then.
</I>&gt;<i> Let's go over to iproute2.
</I>&gt;<i> Please make iproute2 a requirement for networks
</I>&gt;<i> and go ahead and modify the templates accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I don't wanna oblige anyone... if everybody agree then I'll do the 
changes....
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no we don't althought it's better to have uniform interface....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the good thing with ip is also that it can handle route, providing a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> single way to configure everything related to ip
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That probably shaves 5 thousands of a second off the boot time.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> But what if we want to change the routing table on the fly to add or
</I>&gt;<i> remove a default route for example.
</I>&gt;<i> Must we also adjust an interface?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>hummm it makes me think... how does pppoe change route? with ifconfig?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you can use ipv6 and ipv4 at the same time without problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for example I have both since I use a tunnel to connect to the 6thbone....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is how I used to do it, a long time ago.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I wonder if tunneling IPv6 through IPv4 looses
</I>&gt;<i> some of the advantages of IPv6 such as multi-casting?
</I>&gt;<i> Anything interesting on the mbone these days?
</I>well in fact for me this is more to prevent using nat.... nat is trouble 
making.... especially if you have several servers.... also when someone 
comes there is always stuff to changes in configuration to fit a pecular 
need.... ipv6 dhcp simply get ride of that burden.... he use that 
special soft that require that special port to be opened? he has sip? or 
sctp? well fine.... he have direct access to inet...
and tunneling don't make lose any ipv6 advantages because in fact this 
is as is you were directly connected to ipv6 bone through the ISP....
