<PRE>Event logs may give a better idea of why gcc-v3.3 is casting.
There are a tiny number of spells that require it


* AdobeReader
* ati-driver-installer
* fglrx-xorg
gtkmm-v1.2
* jdk
libsigc++-v1.0
linuxrogue
loser
* w32codec
zblast


As you see above the spells that require gcc-v3.3
are either libraries which are rarely used or
they are required by pre-compiled software.
The pre-compiled software I highlighted with '*'

If gcc-v3.3 is not installed and one of the above is
then that above installed software component may
attempt to recast a few times each week.
That is because sorcery will detect that the installed
software has a requirement on an ELF library that
is not installed, but should be installed.
If you tell it
# augur exile gcc-v3.3
then sorcery will not attempt to cast gcc-v3.3
It will also probably proceed with trying to re-cast
the obviously broken installed pre-compiled software.
That will probably work, as long as it it does not
really compile with gcc-v3.3

Is the failure of gcc-v3.3 to compile a localized problem
or a distribution wide problem?
Is it no longer possible to compile gcc-v3.3 with
the current version of gcc installed.

If gcc-v3.3 is installed, but still is recompiling
then it may be due to an adjustment in the way
ldd logs are created and/or checked.
If augur event gcc-v3.3 suggests that then
you could manually edit /etc/sorcery/log/ldd/gcc-v3.3
in order to correct the problem.
Otherwise sorcery tends to correct problems in the
the usual fashion, by re-casting the spell.

If you have no software installed that requires gcc-v3.3
And gcc-v3.3 is installed
then you could simply try
# dispel gcc-v3.3
If you uninstall it
and it is not required
then it will not return.

exile gcc-v3.3 only as a last resort, because it may cause problems
later on that are near impossible to detect while you have forgotten
that gcc-v3.3 is exiled.
