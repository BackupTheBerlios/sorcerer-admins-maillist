</I>&gt;<i> My conclusion of course was,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Yes, that is very fast!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, is efficient computing over when booting has completed?
</I>&gt;<i> After booting completes the computer is probably mostly idle
</I>&gt;<i> while awaiting someone to login and
</I>&gt;<i> to begin execution of programs such as firefox.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if the norm for the workstation is for someone to login
</I>&gt;<i> and begin execution of programs within 5 minutes after boot
</I>&gt;<i> then should not the computer anticipate that and begin
</I>&gt;<i> loading files into memory before they are needed?
</I>&gt;<i> Seems like a simple task for a computer to accomplish, yes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Take firefox for example.
</I>&gt;<i> It reads many files when it starts up.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, starting firefox may require 10 or more seconds
</I>&gt;<i> if the computer recently finished booting.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if firefox was previously loaded and exited
</I>&gt;<i> then the files may still be in the kernel cache.
</I>&gt;<i> If firefox's files are cached then starting firefox may require merely 1
</I>&gt;<i> second.
</I>&gt;<i> 1 second is better than 10, yes?
</I>&gt;<i> By that realization I decided that
</I>&gt;<i> computers should anticipate the files that will be read
</I>&gt;<i> and it should load the contents of those files into RAM before they are
</I>&gt;<i> needed,
</I>&gt;<i> because a computer with pre-cached files can start programs faster.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After discarding several potential implementations I created
</I>&gt;<i> an implementation that is efficient, eloquent, and simple and
</I>&gt;<i> I call it bootblaze.
</I>&gt;<i> I added it to the sorcery tools along with an optional init script.
</I>&gt;<i> Merely select the bootblaze init script as on for it to run during boot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The way bootblaze works is simple.
</I>&gt;<i> When the box is booted bootblaze memorizes the files
</I>&gt;<i> that are opened during the first five minutes of execution.
</I>&gt;<i> It memorizes executables, ELF libraries, and data files.
</I>&gt;<i> It adds those to a list /etc/bootblaze.conf
</I>&gt;<i> Until /etc/bootblaze.conf is populated no pre-caching of files during
</I>&gt;<i> boot is possible.
</I>&gt;<i> However, once /etc/bootblaze.conf exists the contents of those files,
</I>&gt;<i> listed in /etc/bootblaze.conf, are read into RAM by bootblaze during boot.
</I>&gt;<i> Then, when a program tries to read one of the pre-cached files the
</I>&gt;<i> contents
</I>&gt;<i> can be quickly read from RAM instead of wasting any CPU cycles on waiting
</I>&gt;<i> for the fixed disk to read the file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Configuration is easier than making an ACL.
</I>&gt;<i> Verify /etc/init.d/bootblaze exists and is mode 0700
</I>&gt;<i> Verify that /etc/bootblaze.conf does not exist.
</I>&gt;<i> Reboot.
</I>&gt;<i> Login and execute all the programs typically running within 5 minutes
</I>&gt;<i> of booting.
</I>&gt;<i> Configuration is complete!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To change the configuration of bootblaze simply
</I>&gt;<i> remove /etc/bootblaze.conf and repeat the steps in the above paragraph.
</I>&gt;<i> If /etc/bootblaze.conf is more than 2 days old during boot
</I>&gt;<i> then bootblaze will add to /etc/bootblaze.conf
</I>&gt;<i> files that are read within the first 5 minutes of booting.
</I>&gt;<i> That way if installed software has been updated
</I>&gt;<i> and different files are being loaded during boot
</I>&gt;<i> then bootblaze will recognize and adapt to the change.
</I>&gt;<i> It is an automatic reconfiguration.
</I>&gt;<i> Without need for further elaboration
</I>&gt;<i> bootblaze uses an intelligent method
</I>&gt;<i> to determine what files to keep in
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/bootblaze.conf and what files to dismiss.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One important limitation is that bootblaze will not enter into
</I>&gt;<i> /etc/bootblaze.conf files that exist in /home directories.
</I>&gt;<i> Consider it a privacy concern that bootblaze only
</I>&gt;<i> pays attention to files read in within in /bin /etc /usr /sbin
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for taking the time to learn about this new sorcery functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> The last obvious question is probably
</I>&gt;<i> what boxes should become bootblaze enabled?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many of us keep both our workstations running all the time
</I>&gt;<i> and reboot only after installing a new kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> Keeping computers constantly on is healthier for fixed disks, power
</I>&gt;<i> supplies and fans.
</I>&gt;<i> Frequent powering down and powering up of computers,
</I>&gt;<i> even once per day,
</I>&gt;<i> can cause fixed disks, power supplies, and fans to fail prematurely.
</I>&gt;<i> Computers left on all the time will rarely benefit from bootblaze.
</I>&gt;<i> However there is no significant cost for using bootblaze other than
</I>&gt;<i> selecting it as on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Conversely, off time is a norm for notebooks.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, notebooks should benefit for using bootblaze.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> sorcery with bootblaze will arrive sometime this week.
</I>&gt;<i> This informational update email was sent a few days in advance
</I>&gt;<i> to inform SAs of the new functionality to avoid being caught unaware
</I>&gt;<i> when granted the option of having /etc/init.d/bootblaze run during boot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For those more interested in a new I/R set...
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, next weekend may be as soon as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> Do not hold your breath.
</I>&gt;<i> It is not a promise.
</I>&gt;<i> I loathe committing the effort to have some silly mistake render them
</I>&gt;<i> unsuable.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone who requires a change to the I/Rs send me a message this week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Already, they will have kernels configured very differently than the
</I>&gt;<i> previous release
</I>&gt;<i> and should work for even USB CDROMs without the trouble of shelling
</I>&gt;<i> to load additional modules, run busybox mdev, and manually create the
</I>&gt;<i> /dev/cdrom symbolic link.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the inconveniences it has already caused.

</I>That's a good new functionality, my laptop has 2GB ram and often after boot
there is no more disc access....
I would have liked to have a config file where to put the binaries we want
to have cached too... for example, I know I will run firefox, konqueror,
vim, gliv, pidgim at least once during a session but not necessarly during
the 5 first minutes but for efficiency I would like to have those preloaded
into ram (for example I'm on a trip and want to have only disc access during
startup and after only use ram) no matter what.... so is it possible to have
thoses files and dependencies preloaded into ram?
thanks
Best Regards
JLM
