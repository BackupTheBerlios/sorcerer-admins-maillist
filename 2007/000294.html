What has been fixed? Which spell(s)? I am asking because the latest xorg 
upgrade has been quite painfull so far and there are still things I have not 
been able to resolve.

In particular, the xf86-video-intel driver performs much worse than 
xf86-video-i810 on my laptop with Intel 855GM graphics, I get diagonal moire 
and it always comes up with vertical refresh 11 Hz (!) instead of configured 
60 or 75 Hz. I can switch it to higher refresh rate after it starts up but it 
is annoying and the moire remains (and the lousy 3d performance too).

So I reverted to the i810 driver.

Next serious issue is the xf86-input-evdev driver, marked as broken in the 
grimoire. I have filed a bug report and the response was that version 1.2.0 
is needed. Funny, because the xorg release offers 1.1.2 and if you look into 
the individual xorg collection, version 1.1.5 can be found.

After much searching,  I found 1.2.0 in the evdev git repository and it did 
compile with xorg-server 1.4. Unfortunately, the driver fails to load:
(EE) Logitech_VX: cannot open input pEvdev
(EE) PreInit returned NULL for &quot;Logitech_VX&quot;

So I submitted another bug report but no response yet. Without working evdev, 
the mouse configuration is difficult: If /dev/input/mice is used, every click 
is reported twice (both press and release events) which makes it difficult to 
get around. This may be solved by some udev rules that would create a 
persistently named link in /dev/input for each mice but I haven't tested it 
yet (with the laptop I use different mice at home, in my office and on 
travel, what a mess - the fallback configuration is now useless, because it 
cannot use /dev/input/mice).

Well, if you got suggestion or solutions, I will certainly appreciate them.
