<PRE>I can not say whether the pre-compiled binary drivers from NVIDIA are
worthy or buggy.
The xf86-video-intel for X11R7.3 seems to be problematic,
but can be circumvented by installing xf86-video-i810 instead.
xf86-input-evdev Jan reported to be unsable in X11R7.3,
but that can be circumvented by using the version from git.
There is a crashing bug in xorg-server from X11R7.3,
but that appears to be circumvented by a patch I added.

But for those not interested in the potential problems staying with
X11R7.2 may be the easy solution.
I would not update a group of dissimilar workstations to X11R7.3
and risk unhappy users.

Someone, perhaps Jan, mentioned that X11R7.3 is now far better
at autoconfiguration than previous releases and that perhaps in
the near future we may be able to deploy X servers without having
to create an /etc/X11/xorg.conf
That may be exciting news for those who find getting
that file just right to be a pain.
But those of us using dual monitors fancy pointers and other
unusual devices may still have to stick with config files.
Also config files are probably also required for color depth,
virtual desktop size, resolution specifications and specifying
horz and vert frequencies for old monitors and such.

For those who like DirectFB we may yet soon see something like
a window manager for use with DirectFB and linux-fusion.
But that still seems like it may be yet far away.
However, it is exciting to see an alternative to using an Xserver.
