<PRE>Someone requested something like stall prevention for the sorcery tools.
I finally, implemented it with sorcery implosion.
However, I took it a bit further than necessary, as usual.
The implementation has a useful side effect.
When stall immunity is enabled spells can also be placed
into the queues to be processed in the future.
In some cases spells are automatically queued in the future.

Spells queued by
# augur newer
# augur newer_ia
are queued to cast 1 hour from present.

Spells queued by any of the sorcery menus
will be queued to cast or dispel 1 year from present.

However, you need not wait for the future to arrive.
Selecting Run from the Queue Menu of sorcery will
cause the queued files to receive current time stamps
and then dispel and cast will run on them instead of ignoring them.

Likewise:
# augur update
causes the spells in the cast queue to receive current time stamps.


Wondering why spells may be queued in with future time stamps?
Sorcery stall immunity perceives a stall condition exists only
when the spell in the queue has a current or past timestamp.
Spells with future time stamps are considered postponed rather than stalled.
However when immune detects stalled spells it will activate
cast, dispel, leech as appropriate to resume activity.
Therefore, if
# augur newer
queued spells with current timestamps
then it is possible that immune would launch cast
before the SA had a chance to adjust the queued spells and run
# augur update

Yes this present past future stuff is confusing.
A moment may be required to become used to it.
However, if you remember the following
then you will probably not encounter any problems
due to the stall immunity.

# augur sync
# augur newer
# augur update    # do not execute cast instead of # augur update

When using sorcery:
sorcery -&gt; Software -&gt; Queue -&gt; Run


For boxes where the above steps do not appear to work please continue reading.

The way that the sorcery tools quickly determine whether a queued spell has
a future, present, or past timestamp is by comparing the file in the queue to
/proc/version

I checked several boxes.
/proc/version appears to always have a timestamp that is current.
Or perhaps it is better to say that /proc/version always has a time
stamp of now.
If there is a box where /proc/version has a timestamp that is in the past
then cast, dispel, and leech will not view the content of the queues correctly.
If /proc/version has a timestamp in the past then any spell queued even with
a current timestamp will appear to have a future time stamp when compared
to /proc/version
Spells with future time stamps are ignored by cast and dispel.

To check that /proc/version is current simply compare
$ date
with
$ ls -lah /proc/version

I hope everyone finds the stall immunity to be a boon rather than confusing.
For example the first task begun in the office can be the the last task
completed if the SA queues spells to cast a few hours after
they expect to have already left and gone home.


The stall immunity can be enabled from sorcery's immunity menu.
More information is available from:
# cast --help
# dispel --help
$ man touch

The sorcery tools use the exact same parameter and format that touch uses.
# ls -lah /root/.sorcery/queue/cast/
Can be used to verify the correct expected timestamp of the queued spells.
Once the format is learned it is very easy to use.

Lastly, do not forget to enable sorcery's stall immunity if you want to
have spells with future time stamps to cast automatically in the future.
Unless IMMUNITY is not set in /etc/sorcery/local.config
boxes will not gain stall immunity automatically.
