&gt;<i> &gt; I propose that current system should be improved in way that there is 
</I>no
&gt;<i> &gt; need to split spells, but to improve requirement chain checking to 
</I>include
&gt;<i> &gt; to check that needed optional requirements is set to on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is easy to think of, easy to suggest, and easy to implement.
</I>&gt;<i> It really has only one cost.
</I>&gt;<i> Speed!
</I>&gt;<i> The way requirements are written currently is a bit slow to handle

</I>
Well, speedwise, we are compiling from sources, its slow process anyway, 
we can't say we are fastest distro to install new apps anyway.

&gt;<i> I may have been merely lucky that I was able to deduce a bash
</I>&gt;<i> command to properly separate the spell in front of the : from
</I>&gt;<i> the stuff that follows in order to be able to quickly generate
</I>&gt;<i> the grimoire index.
</I>
So what it's doing when generating index, its checking requirement and 
doing some index from requirement (some sort of pre-calc?) and thats why 
it would slow index generation?
I like current speedy index generation (compared when it was so damn 
slow), but can those parts move to eg. when cast is about to run first 
time?

&gt;<i> Adding onto the specification for an optional requirement
</I>&gt;<i> will make cast slower while providing a functionality that currently
</I>&gt;<i> is required for only 1 spell and perhaps at most no more than 5 spells.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, the the benefit does not outweigh the cost.
</I>
Somehow i feel why Gentoo uses global USE-flag, it has beneficts that 
those optional parts are set on globally. 
Anyway, i think we are missing one feature that might be usefull. Eg. if 
you cast x.org and you have casted earlier spells which has some libx11, 
etc, optional part, so i would like to have easy way to re-cast all 
installed spells which have libx11 as optional part, so it would ask if 
you want to re-cast this spell with libx11 on. 

Also whats most easiest way to dispell spells, example if you want to 
dispell x.org, are we missing some sort of depency check here, so if i to 
dispell xorg, should it also be able to dispell all other spells which 
requires xorg, some sort of reverse check?
