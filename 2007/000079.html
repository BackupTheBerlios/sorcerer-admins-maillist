That is correct.
That is because the templates are simple.
Combine templates into a single file to bring up multiple networks.
The way it works is straight forward.
It tries to raise the first network as found in the first file.
If it works it is done.
If it does not work then it tries the next file.
Having subdirectories for containing multiple networks to try
is a bit more confusing to set up.
What happens if it is trying 3 of the 3 files in a subdir for
setting up 3 networks concurrently and it only achieves
success for 2 out of the 3?
Does it quit?
Does it try the next subdirectory that defines more networks?
Behavior is undefined and confusing.
The way it works now is not so confusing.
Just activate all the networks from a single script.
Exit 0 if fine, 1 if a problem exists.
No rewriting required.



&gt;<i> here is a script that do the stuff
</I>
&gt;<i> another whish is to use iproute2 instead of net-tools for script since
</I>&gt;<i> thoses tools also have ipv6 support...
</I>
You can do that if you want.
Perhaps you will contribute some templates for
suggested IPv6 configuration of networks, please?
I wonder if iproute2 is installed on I/Rs?
Maybe not.
That might be a tiny inconvenience for setting up boxes on IPv6 networks.
Hmm, maybe not.
ifconfig supports IPv6 addresses.
ifconfig is from net-tools
I guess we could do without iproute2,
unless there was something specific about it
that net-tools does not provide?
At least, we need not change all the templates
provided to use the iproute2 tools at this moment, yes?
Could be useful having templates that can use either or both?
That would be a good idea along with having templates for
configuring IPv6 networks.
An extra line here and there would not be so tricky.
Most interfaces can also be set up to use both IPv4 and IPv6 concurrently, yes?
Could be useful.
