<PRE>Yesterday I started an update of my x86_64 box and I ran into a problem.  I
cast
augur synch
augur newer &gt;&gt;newer.txt

Then I looked in newer.txt to see what was needed.  The box I'm running on I
haven't yet been able to succesfully get a windows environment running, and
I've run into issues when I load the cast que up with a lot of spells so I
have gotten into the habit of piping lists to text files, then casting the
spells one at a time.  Anyway, one of the first spells I tried to cast was
'services'.  I cast

cast -c services

Leech went and downloaded the source, Then my box seemed to compile the
spell, but it has been stuck for about 15 hours now displaying the following

Compile log for services 2007-9
Built with sorcery thaumaturgy-20070907-0 and gcc 4.2.1
Built on Sat Sept 22 05:19:50 CDT 2007
Traced with sentinal
Preparing to install services
Dispelled spell: services


This is where it hangs.  I let it run all night last night to see if it
would finish, but I don't think it should be taking this long.  I have tried
to quit but the box appears to be locked.  I hit
'q', got nothing, I tried 'ctl-c' and nothing.  I don't want to hard restart
the box incase it will break something.  Any suggestions as to what I need
to do?  Or what I did wrong?

Thanks
