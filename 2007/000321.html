Precisely!
What does every Sorcerer box have in common when they boot?
Plenty of empty RAM!
Why wait for it to fill?
Cram the RAM ASAP.  :)
Since it is a computer it should anticipate what files will be needed
and have them loaded into RAM before they are required.
At least a workstation aught to work that way.

</I>
Yes, absolutely.
However, editing /etc/bootblaze.conf
may not be as effective as allowing bootblaze to
auto-detect files that are read during the first 5 minutes.
Take firefox for example.
Adding /usr/bin/firefox directly to /etc/bootblaze.conf gains no advantage.
Why?

$ ls -alh /usr/bin/firefox
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 5.2K 2007-11-01 21:46 /usr/bin/firefox

Because /usr/bin/firefox is merely 5.2K.
firefox requires a long time to load because
over 100 files including datafiles, executables, and libraries
are opened when firefox starts.
To effectively expedite the startup of firefox all those files
should be entered into /etc/bootblaze.conf in the correct order.
Fortunately, bootblaze can do that.

# rm -f /etc/bootblaze.conf
# shutdown -r now

When the box reboots, log in.
Start the programs that you normally start in their normal order.
Continue to load the other programs that you might use such as:

&gt;<i> vim, gliv, pidgim at least once during a session but not necessarly during
</I>&gt;<i> the 5 first minutes
</I>
Processes are not required to continue running the entire 5 minutes.
Quit them anytime.
After about 5 minutes the disk will become momentarily active as bootblaze
discovers the files that were read and lists those in /etc/bootblaze.conf
The files now logged in /etc/bootblaze.conf
bootblaze will load automatically into RAM during boot,
consequently, expediting the startup of programs that use those files.

The principle is as simple as a tape recorder.
Press record for 5 minutes on first boot.
Press play for 1 minutes on subsequent boots.
bootblaze does that automatically.

Bootblaze does not track files read from /home /opt /tmp /var
Therefore, a minimal amount of disk activity
may happen when programs are started that read
directories and datafiles in the user's home directory.
With firefox there is a measurable delay,
but with most other programs delay is minuscule.

If /etc/bootblaze.conf is over 2 days old during boot
then bootblaze will again observe files loaded during
the first 5 minutes and add those to the list in
/etc/bootblaze.conf while at the same time removing
from the list any files that no longer exist.
To put it simply: activate it, configure it and forget about it.


You mentioned wanting something that bootblaze is not intended to do:

&gt;<i> (for example I'm on a trip and want to have only disc access during
</I>&gt;<i> startup and after only use ram) no matter what
</I>
Unfortunately, bootblaze can not help you there.
However, there are yet ways to accomplish that goal.
