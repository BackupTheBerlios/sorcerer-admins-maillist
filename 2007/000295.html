Seems that hang problem may be isolated to the i810 driver
provided by xf86-video-intel?
I have a box just like that.
Fortunately, it is not being used as a work-station.
If you find a fix for it, please provide.
As of yesterday I checked for a newer version of
xf86-video-intel, and none newer were available.


&gt;<i> In particular, the xf86-video-intel driver performs much worse than
</I>&gt;<i> xf86-video-i810 on my laptop with Intel 855GM graphics, I get diagonal moire
</I>&gt;<i> and it always comes up with vertical refresh 11 Hz (!) instead of configured
</I>&gt;<i> 60 or 75 Hz. I can switch it to higher refresh rate after it starts up but it
</I>&gt;<i> is annoying and the moire remains (and the lousy 3d performance too).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I reverted to the i810 driver.
</I>
Does the xf86-video-i810 work with X11R7.3 or merely X11R7.2?


&gt;<i> Next serious issue is the xf86-input-evdev driver, marked as broken in the
</I>&gt;<i> grimoire. I have filed a bug report and the response was that version 1.2.0
</I>&gt;<i> is needed. Funny, because the xorg release offers 1.1.2 and if you look into
</I>&gt;<i> the individual xorg collection, version 1.1.5 can be found.
</I>
So what version if xf86-input-evdev driver do you recommend that we use?


&gt;<i> After much searching,  I found 1.2.0 in the evdev git repository and it did
</I>&gt;<i> compile with xorg-server 1.4. Unfortunately, the driver fails to load:
</I>&gt;<i> (EE) Logitech_VX: cannot open input pEvdev
</I>&gt;<i> (EE) PreInit returned NULL for &quot;Logitech_VX&quot;
</I>
&gt;<i> So I submitted another bug report but no response yet. Without working evdev,
</I>&gt;<i> the mouse configuration is difficult: If /dev/input/mice is used, every click
</I>&gt;<i> is reported twice (both press and release events) which makes it difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> get around. This may be solved by some udev rules that would create a
</I>&gt;<i> persistently named link in /dev/input for each mice but I haven't tested it
</I>&gt;<i> yet (with the laptop I use different mice at home, in my office and on
</I>&gt;<i> travel, what a mess - the fallback configuration is now useless, because it
</I>&gt;<i> cannot use /dev/input/mice).
</I>
Section &quot;InputDevice&quot;

# Identifier and driver

    Identifier  &quot;Mouse1&quot;
    Driver      &quot;mouse&quot;
    Option &quot;Protocol&quot;    &quot;PS/2&quot; # PS/2 Mouse
    Option &quot;Device&quot;      &quot;/dev/misc/psaux&quot;

EndSection

That could be difficult if you do not have a ps/2 style mouse, yes?
I am not effected by that bug.
Are there any other work-arounds?
I rarely consider mouse configuration with X.


&gt;<i> Well, if you got suggestion or solutions, I will certainly appreciate them.
</I>
ps/2 style port trackball with three buttons?
