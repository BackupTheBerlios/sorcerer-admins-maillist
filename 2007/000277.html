sorcery is highly dependent on certain programs
being installed and working flalessly:
bash, sed, grep, find, coreutils, etc....

Either you must discover which of those is broken and fix it manually
or you should bulk replace them with the versions installed on the I/R

For example:

# mount /media/cd
# cd /
# cat /media/cd/etc/sorcery/log/install/pcre  |
tar --no-recursion -C /media/cd -cPT -         |
tar --overwrite -Uxf -

The above code could be used to transfer the files for almost any spell
from the I/R to the hard disk filesystem.
Probably best not to try and replace bash, glibc, ncurses, or readline that way.
However, it aught to work for sed, pcre, grep, find, coreutils, etc....
After the broken installed versions are overwritten with the ones from the I/R
clean up what is left.

# augur alien  |  tee /tmp/aliens.txt

Look through the /tmp/aliens.txt and potentially problematic alien files
such as residual libraries or symbolic links left behind from the installed
versions of spells that you overwrote.

Finally,
# ldconfig

Once the programs that are important for sorcery
to work correctly work then sorcery will work correctly.


&gt;<i> Why it isnt hardware fault, well, because in last weekend, i compiled linux
</I>&gt;<i> kernel ok, no faults. Its pretty stable if its manages to compiles linux
</I>&gt;<i> kernel, its pretty resource hungry process.
</I>
linux is nearly unique.
You could have a box without glibc header files installed.
And on that box you could still compile linux, probably since
linux does not require those header files.
But it might if make menuconfig is executed.
lxdialog probably requires ncures and readline headers
that probably require glibc headers.
It could be possible to compile linux on a box that has
some unusual and annoying breaks.


&gt;<i> Perhaps its bash-problem or some utility which index is using that's
</I>&gt;<i> crashing system....
</I>
It is possible that a spell can crash index generation.
However, I have not seen anything like that in a while.
Usually, it says what spell and why.
And that is obviously easy to fix.
Just edit the spell in /root/.sorcery/grimoire/
and then repeat # augur index

Without logging into the box I can not tell you exactly what
exactly is broken and must be fixed for sorcery to work properly.
You could try looking at a bash trace for # augur index,
but that is extremely difficult to follow.
Likewise without knowing which sorcery is installed I am uncertain
whether or not grep will effect index generation.
However, I would definitely recommend checking and fixing if required
find, grep, sed, coreutils, pcre.

If you want to install a newer sorcery, go ahead and do so manually.
You can download:
<A HREF="http://sorcerer.silverice.org/download/sorcery/sorcery-implosion-20070924-2.tar.bz2">http://sorcerer.silverice.org/download/sorcery/sorcery-implosion-20070924-2.tar.bz2</A>

Unpack it to a temporary directory in /tmp
Then, run ./install implosion-20070922-0
But you will end up creating a problem if sorcery
detects that /etc/sorcery/config became a customized configuration file.
Therefore, if you manually install it then replace the md5sum value in
/etc/sorcery/md5sum/sorcery
for the file /etc/sorcery/config
with the md5sum for the /etc/sorcery/config
that you just installed.
Then, you can edit /etc/sorcery/log/version/sorcery
and increase the version to the one you installed.
Everything else is basically the same.

On the next grimoire update sorcery the available sorcery is switching to
sorcery-implosion-20070924-2
So once the box is fixed it would receive that sorcery anyway.
sorcery-implosion-20070924-2 does not use grep as much.
Aside from generating the order index, which is very important,
grep might not be used any other place during index generation.
However, I still recommend fixing grep and pcre on that box.

Replacing installed spells with version from the
IR as I describe above is very sloppy.
But generally it does not risk multiplying any existing problems.
When the index is broken, running dispel is way too dangerous.
Replacing a few broken installed spells with known good versions
from the I/R is a much faster and easier solution than redeployment
or even chrooted rebuilding.

Good luck.
