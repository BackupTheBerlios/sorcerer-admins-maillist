<PRE>Reads like a mess.
But it is probably not difficult to fix.

I recommend that you first verify that binutils coreutils and db are installed.
Then, issue
# augur index
That will clear out the old failures.

gcc should be installed.
If not I hope you have an archive of it or some other gcc installed.
If you want to compile gcc with an older version the easiest way to do so
is to edit the /root/.sorcery/grimoire/gcc spell
and add to it
USE_GCC=&quot;gcc-v4.1&quot;

Otherwise you will have to create a cpref file
and then adjust the cpref for gcc temporarily
using the augur cpref.

If gcc 4.2.1. is installed then you probably should not have to recast it.
Most other failures you can probably ignore.
I recommend:
# augur sync
# augur newer
# augur update

If db does fail to compile
then it can autofail anything that requires it
to include coreutils and gcc
If that db failed compilation
then to correct why it is failing should be a priority.
Once db cast correctly it will not cause a string of auto failures.
If it remains a problem you can issue:

# augur sync
# augur newer
# augur abort db
# augur update

In this sequence of command db is removed from the cast queue
if it is queued to be cast and therefore allows the other software
waiting to be updated to be updated.
That might enable most of the installed software to update
while leaving db for you to examine the compile log and
deduce and correct the compilation problem later.

&gt;<i> Ok, so over the past week I've done what I could on this issue when I've had
</I>&gt;<i> time.  I have played around with a fe things and I'm pretty sure I'm having
</I>&gt;<i> a failure of my gcc.  Some things seem to compile, but a majority of them
</I>&gt;<i> fail.  I have tried to dispel gcc, then cast -c -r it again to try and fix
</I>&gt;<i> it.  I have done an 'augur synch' within the past thirty minutes, and the
</I>&gt;<i> version of gcc available is 4.2.1.  This is what I have on my box right now.
</I>&gt;<i>  Anyway, when I try and re-cast gcc I get the following lines.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Fail: Sun Aug 19 .... binutil 2.17 autofailed by binutils&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Fail Sun Aug 19..... gcc 4.2.1 autofailed by db&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've tried to dispel and cast binutils and db.  Both generated the
</I>&gt;<i> 'autofailed by ...' where they seem to fail themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I tried an 'augur update' earlier today, and got lots and lots of compile
</I>&gt;<i> failures.  Not everything failed though.  I don't see an obvious correlation
</I>&gt;<i> between what failed and what didn't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do see that I have gcc-v3.0 and gcc-v4.0 installed on my box.  I believe
</I>&gt;<i> this is from the original install.  Is there anyway to dispel gcc and use
</I>&gt;<i> either of these to try and rebuild the newest version of gcc?  And if I do
</I>&gt;<i> that, don't I have to go back to previous versions of glibc?  I seem to
</I>&gt;<i> remember reading somewhere that glibc and gcc are tied together at the
</I>&gt;<i> version level.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for any suggestions.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please go ahead and dispel busybox.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Although it is installed, by default, and used during the boot of the I/R
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is never used after that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I should go ahead and adjust the update criteria for busybox
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to dispel it on deployed Sorcerer boxes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Anyway, I am going to start over again from scratch.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Almost all spell use the gcc spell for compilation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If that is okay, then compilation should be okay.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Starting over is not advised since there is typically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no problems too difficult to surmount after managing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to configure the linux kernel, install the skeleton, boot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the box, and have it connect to the network.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After that it only becomes easier.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another aspect to consider is that the updated I/R
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are built ontop of the old I/R for the most part simply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by doing the same that would be accomplished by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; augur sync; augur newer; augur update
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ultimately, if you try to spot and fix the problems you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may learn and hone your skills.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do not mean to seem insensitive.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When I was a novice I reinstalled distros like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Redhat and Debian multiple times on a box.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I understand that nagging feeling and thought
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that perhaps I installed the wrong thing or omitted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something else or made some mistake,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and that starting over with a fresh install
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will be able to get it entirely correct this time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But eventually you can work through it and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it will only be a memory.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sometime before I created Sorcerer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was doing Debian installations without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using the Debian menu driven installer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Easily most Sorcerer SAs could do a Sorcerer installation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without using the sorcerer menu driven installer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Eventually, a comprehensive understanding of what must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be done step by step to deploy a Sorcerer box will become
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as apparent and easy to do as walking and talking concurrently.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes it does become that easy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That is why I encourage you to ride out the roughness.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the problems do seem insurmountable you can always redeploy,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but there may be much yet to learn before that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lastly if the box is not sensitive and you want me to take a look at it,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can lend you my public ssh key so I can log in as a guest and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; take a quick look.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is usually no problem on a sorcerer box that once
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; identified can not be fixed with 5 commands or less.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is usually far faster than the time required to reinstall
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and then reupdate from an I/R that is 6 months or older.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Thanks for you help and suggestions.  I'm very impressed at the level of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; support around here.
