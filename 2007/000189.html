</I>
People used to say that about -O3
:<i>)
</I>And it was true that for a time in certain situations -O3 did cause breaks.
Even now, -O2 is mandatory for compilation of glibc.
CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS are modified to enforce -O2 for glibc compilation.
Anyway, it seems that qt-x11-opensource compiles about half of it's
object files with -O2 even if CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS specifiy -Os.
Chances are it will probably work should you compile it with -Os,
but if not you can always recast and use -O2.
For now I will not enforce the use of -O2 for any spell except glibc
or for a spell where -Os or -O3 has been identified to cause a problem.
A problem must exist and not merely be conjectured.


&gt;<i> disk space is cheap, buy larger hdd ;).
</I>
However, the past recommendation is to deploy Sorcerer boxes
with a 2G dedicated /tmp and a 2G dedicated /usr/src/sorcery
or to have a 2G tmpfs mounted on /usr/src/sorcery
However, I would not recommend compiling qt-x11-opensource
on tmpfs even on a box with 2G of RAM installed, merely because
compilation of c++ can require a magnitude more megabytes of
memory than mere c.

Therefore, being able to cast qt-x11-opensource on deployed
Sorcerer boxes without SA modification of those boxes is the
desired outcome.
We do not want SAs to have to make drastic modification to
existing Sorcerer boxes to become compatible with the
future KDE3 to KDE4 update.
However, I will put in the install recommendations that
/usr/src/sorcery be a dedicated 4G partition of space allows
or 3G partition if space is limited.


&gt;<i> Otherwise consider system where we can use/download pre-compiled spells
</I>&gt;<i> without compiling them but current system where we have optional
</I>&gt;<i> requirements per spell thats not easily done.
</I>
It would be possible to provide a near completely statically
linked qt-x11-opensource.
It would take up more disk space.
It would be nearly 100M to download.
And it may not comply with the qt-x11-opensource license agreement.
However, I doubt that it would.

Currently, we make a couple of concessions for allowing spells for
pre-compiled binaries in the grimoire.
1. closed source drivers for nvidia cards.
2. openoffice ( because it is so huge and takes days to compile if you
can figure it out )
3. jdk ( for reasons similar to openoffice )

In contrast, qt-x11-opensource is not closed source,
is not difficult to compile,
and is not so big that it can not be compiled within the 2G
dedicated /usr/src/sorcery/ if demos and examples are omitted.

For the time being I do not want to have qt-x11-opensource
installed on Sorcerer boxes from pre-compiled binaries.
However, if that becomes a good idea then it may be possible
to accomplish if the pre-compiled binaries provided by trolltech
have no ELF library requirements besides glibc, or very few.

Using a precompiled binary for qt-x11-opensource is not beyond consideration
but has not yet reached a point where that possible solution merits
consideration.

For the meanwhile since Sorcerer is a source based distribution it
tends to work best and heal up the problems that come from library
updates when all the installed spells that are effected by library updates
have sources from which the installed version can be recompiled and
relinked with the newly installed libraries.
If qt-x11-opensource was provided as a pre-compiled binary then
it might also require additional spells for libraries such as jpeg
and png that install very specific versions of those libraries
so that the libraries provided are those that were qt-x11-opensource
was dynamically linked with at compile time.
However, if qt-x11-opensource was statically linked with those
graphic libraries and database libraries and so forth
then that would greatly mitigate the potential for qt-x11-opensource
having an ELF library requirement for which no installed spell can fulfill.

Sorry if the above paragraph read complicated.

Sources are like clay.
Pre-compiled binaries are like stone.
Since pre-compiled binaries can not be re-shaped
everything else around pre-compiled binaries
must be altered for the pre-compiled binary
to fit and work correctly.
That could require considerable effort.
And that is the simple explanation.
