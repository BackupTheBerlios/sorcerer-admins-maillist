<PRE>Could it be that you are on uhm oh what is that mode called where
it collects all the day's or weeks messages and sends them clumped together?

As for vmware, it reads as if it may be much slower than qemu.
About a minute after starting qemu I am ready to login.
Speed may not be an important factor,
but if it takes minutes or hours to decompress the kernel
then that is probably too slow?

The runtime performance of Sorcerer x86_64 within qemu is decent.
Any of the coreutils provided executables start quickly.
However, compilation is slow.
It reduces an Athlon performance to 80386SX speeds.

Here is something useful for those wanting to run an emulator.
If you have a simple disk file.
You may want to be able to mount it through the loopback device
in order to transfer files to or from it quickly instead of using HTTP or SSH.
# mount -o 32256 /dev/loop0 img.2G
# mount /dev/loop0
When finished.
# umount /dev/loop0
# losetup -d /dev/loop0

I am uncertain if the offset is the same with vmware
as it is with qemu's disk image format.
But it probably would not hurt to try it if you want it.

I wonder if qemu will shape up with 0.9.1 release
or will qemu become history?
Perhaps by March 2008 we shall see?

bochs 2.3.5 release happened in September 16, 2007.
Therefore, it is more recent than qemu.
However, bochs I do not recall x86_64 emulation support in the 2.3.5 release.

vmware seems like a possibility.
They do have open source:
<A HREF="http://www.vmware.com/download/vi/open_source.html">http://www.vmware.com/download/vi/open_source.html</A>

&quot;To use the versions below, you will need a valid license file.
To obtain your license, please follow these steps:

   1. Evaluate or purchase VMware Infrastructure and you will receive
your license activation code.
   2. Redeem your license activation code to create your license.&quot;

But apparently you will still require vmware license to obtain the open source.

vmware can probably afford to either employ the developers of other open
source machine emulators or merely pay them to quit making releases?
I am not holding my breath in anticipation of another release of
bochs or qemu during 2007.
Are there other alternatives for emulating x86_64 and PowerPC 64 machines?
