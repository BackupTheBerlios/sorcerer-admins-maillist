<PRE>Here comes the massive update.
Yes it includes the new sorcery implosion.
Yes it includes X11R7.3.
Yes it includes gnome 2.20
Yes it includes more than 100 other spells.
A deployed box could re-compile over 300 spells.
You may want to check your dev box following this update.
And for those of you lagging behind by a day
the update will become available a day later.

Something worth knowing before you update.
One one box where the X server failed to start
due to me not having the window manager of my choice
installed at the time that I tested it, the X-server did not
return to console as it should but instead left the screen
sort of blank and the keyboard non-functioning.
On another box where I pressed ctrl-alt-backspace to zap the Xserver
that box also did not return to console, but instead was left sort of in an
unusable state where the keyboard was not functioning.
In both situations I simply logged into the
effected box remotely and restarted kdm.
Doing so brought the X server back to fully functioning.

Also...
Boxes with the pre-compiled ATI drivers installed will not update
their installed X.
The pre-compiled binary drivers provided by ATI are not compatible with X11R7.3.
There is nothing we can do about that except wait.
However, I am not holding back the X update for any other Sorcerer boxes
that do not have the pre-compiled ATI drivers installed.
Alternatively, you could switch to using the xorg provided ATI drivers.

Jan reported an issue involving firefox and seamonkey
regarding the new version of pango.
It is no longer a problem.
Firefox and seamonkey will now compile with the new version of pango installed.

Also...
gnome-control-center replaces control-center.
rarian replaces scrollkeeper
xf86-video-intel replaces xf86-video-i810

Finally,
sorcery implosion may prompt for configuration of spells and
for selection of providers for spells that are not or will not be installed.
Without the complex explanation it is simply faster this way.
If for example it prompts for httpd and php configuration,
but you know you will not be running httpd and php on that box
then you need not spend minutes deciding optionals for those spells.
If you know the spell will not be installed then you can simply tap enter
when it comes time to select optionals for that spell.
You can always change it later if you so decide.
