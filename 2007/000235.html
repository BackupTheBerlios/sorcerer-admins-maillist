<PRE>Has anyone gotten GNOME running on a sorcerer box?  I have been trying for
the past few days, well, when I have time during the last few days, and I'm
not having any luck.  The trouble seems to be with libgdiplus.  This is
required my 'mono' which is required by all of GNOME.  Anyway, the spell
libgdiplus is marked as broken, and looking at the details for it, the break
seemed to be with 'cairo'.  I was able to cast cairo by itself, and it
seemed to work.  It had to install an older version of gcc after it had
already cast cairo, and that broke.  But I did an 'augur version cairo' and
got the most recent version.  I then tried to 'cast libgdiplus' but got the
message that the spell was marked as broken.  Has anyone fixed this?  If so,
what did you do?

P.S. I have seen that a lot of people use KDE.  While I have not used KDE a
lot in the past, I'm not opposed to it.  I want to use GNOME because I have
my profile for it already backed up and ready to go.  I don't have tons of
custom stuff so if it will be lots of work to get GNOME working I'll
probably just install KDE and move on.

Thanks
