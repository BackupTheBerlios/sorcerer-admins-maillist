<PRE>Exact error messages are more useful such as:
VFS:Cannot open root device on &quot;303&quot; or unknown block(3,3)

Either the kernel does not have compiled in support for the
IDE, SCSI, or SATA hardware,
or does not have the filesystem drivers compiled into it,
or /etc/lilo.conf has incorrect entries for the boot= or root= line,
or lilo being run is from the previous distro installed and
not the newly installed lilo.

Fixing it is straight forward:
Boot the I/R.
Manually mount the on disk filesystems with the root on /media/root
Also mount the boot partition on /media/root/boot if there is such a partition.
You may also have to mount /media/root/proc
To do so use the mount --bind /proc /media/root/proc

Check, /media/root/usr/src/linux/.config to verify that the required
disk drivers and filesystems are compiled directly into the kernel
and not left unset or M for module.
Fix it if necessary.

If lilo was installed to the MBR of a disk
I would skip down to the next paragraph.
fdisk the device
Mark the partition to boot as bootable.
write the table.
The bootable partition is the partition mounted
on /boot and contains the linux kernel.
boot= and root= are only the same
when there is no separate /boot partition.
If /dev/hda1 is a boot partition, /dev/hda2 is a swap, /dev/hda3 is root
then
boot = /dev/hda1
root = /dev/hda3
Make the changes to /media/root/etc/lilo.conf
and /media/root/etc/lilo.conf.head
# /media/root/sbin/lilo -r /media/root
Run /media/root/usr/bin/ms-sys
to install a MBR that will boot the first available partition marked bootable.
# /media/root/usr/bin/ms-sys -s /dev/hda
The above command would install it on /dev/hda, for example.
Now skip the next paragraph.

Edit /media/root/etc/lilo.conf
Check and adjust root= and boot=.
root should specify a partition such as /dev/hda1
boot should specify a disk such as /dev/hda
Make the same changes to /media/root/etc/lilo.conf.head
# /media/root/sbin/lilo -r /media/root

unmount the partitions mounted at /media/root
reboot using the lilo and linux installed on disk and not the I/R.

If that did not fix it and the box has more than one hard disk installed
then check the BIOS/CMOS to ensure that the disk being booted is
the one that has the distro installed upon.

Boot errors can either be caused by the wrong lilo being run,
an incorrectly configured lilo being run, an incorrect partition table,
and/or an incorrectly compiled linux kernel.
Therefore, the fastest fix is to check and fix them all.

The good news is once you detected and correct the error
it will probably never occur during future installations.
Trying to fix the error is best.

There is no guarantee that the same error will not occur yet again
from a second attempt to install using the menu driven installer.
The menu driven installer will not warn about the content
of the MBR if installing lilo to /dev/hda1, for example.
The menu driven installer will not parse the linux configuration
and warn if there is no compiled in support for the necessary
disk hardware drivers or filesystem drivers.
The menu driven installer will not parse the lilo configuration
to make certain that the designated boot= and root= lines
are correct.

Almost any errors the SA makes the menu driven installer will permit.
The menu driven installer is not a SA nor does it try to be.
It just helps guide the SA along the required sequence of
instructions to install the distro while avoiding the possible
omission of important steps.

When in doubt you can always give a go at repairing
or doing a complete manual installation.
If you do not want to compile a kernel right away you can
attempt to scavenge the kernel from the /isolinux/linux to
boot directly from the hard drive.
It will probably work although it is not intended for a SA
to do that instead of compiling a custom kernel.
If you become thoroughly baffled about whether the
problem is due to an incorrect kernel or an incorrect
lilo then you could try

# cd /media/root/boot/2.6.20.1
# mv linux linux.old
# cp /isolinux/linux linux
# /media/root/sbin/lilo -r /media/root
That way you keep a copy of the previous kernel
while your next attempt to boot the box will boot
the kernel made for the I/R.
Do not even consider trying this until after you have
completed the much longer sequence of steps near
the beginning of the message.
This last test you will probably not want to do anyway,
because it would only succeed if the custom kernel
configuration was incorrect and everything else was correct.
Chances are that the true error will be detected and fixed
in the former sequence of investigation rather than this later.

Good luck.
