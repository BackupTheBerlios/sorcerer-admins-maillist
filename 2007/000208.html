<PRE>I do not know if NVIDIA-Linux-x86 provides glut.
Does it?
If not then glut may require adjustment?


# augur from /glu.h
MesaLib:/usr/include/GL/glu.h

Someone said that NVIDIA-Linux-x86 provides MesaLib.
Therefore, it should install a GL/glu.h
since MesaLib installs GL/glu.h
If it does not then perhaps both MesaLib and NVIDIA-Linux-x86
must be installed concurrently on a box?
I do know that MesaLib provides glut.
So if you have MesaLib installed you will not require glut to be installed.

Your best bet is having someone who uses the NVIDIA-Linux-x86
pre-compiled binary drivers help you trouble-shot the problem.
My nvidia card malfunctioned, sorry.
If I had one I would fix it and probably make the spell work.
For now you may want to try using the nvidia driver provided
by xorg while taking a good look at what is provided by nvidia
and seeing if there is an easy way to integrate it.
The xorg driver will not have 3D accelerated OpenGL,
however it will probably still work.
It will probably even work in SVGA mode.
The nvidia cards appear to have a two separate chipsets
one for just 2d SVGA and the other for the OpenGL.
It was the OpenGL chipset that died on my card.
Since I switched over to ATI I have enjoyed only
marginal success with OpenGL performance.

However, since we are on the topic of the troubles of closed
source pre-compiled binary drivers for graphics cards
I have written a new spell called:

ati-driver-installer

I have not had a chance to test it yet,
because I am still waiting on
two compilations to complete in qemu.
Never tried saving and restoring a state of
the virtual machine using qemu, although I suspect it is possible,
therefore already more than 24 hours into compilation
I would rather just let it complete.
However, the spell is probably not far wrong as is.
And although I gave it the attribute of broken
it will go out in today's grimoire.
My hope is that it should slide right into place with our
xorg X11R7.2 installation and provide top quality accelerated
OpenGL graphics for both ia32 and x86_64 architectures.

I wish I could be more help, but at the moment it seems
that the obvious problem is a lack of GL/glu.h.
If not from MesaLib or NVIDIA-Linux-x86
then I am uncertain what would install GL/glu.h

Something else to know about glut is that it is extremely old.
There have not been any new releases of glut source in a long time.
The glut spell has not been edited since Oct 30, 2006
and even then it was probably merely a cosmetic change.

If I were in your shoes I would probably take a look at MesaLib
It has something interesting about it:

    SOURCE=( &quot;mesa3d/MesaLib-$VERSION.tar.bz2&quot;
             &quot;mesa3d/MesaGLUT-$VERSION.tar.bz2&quot;
             &quot;mesa3d/MesaDemos-$VERSION.tar.bz2&quot; )

If it is possible then perhaps the MesaGlut can be compiled
separately without MesaLib and installed to provide glut.
If that is the case then perhaps a new spell can be created
called MesaGLUT that acts as a drop in replacement for glut?

Well MesaGLUT does contains some Makefile tucked away within
a few layers of subdirectories, but not a configure script.
Perhaps if all 3 sources are combined together as they would
be to compile MesaLib a modified installation could be used
to install merely the glut header files and libraries following compilation?

I probably would choose that road before trying to fix glut,
because MesaLib is newer and probably better maintained than glut.

However, if you want to get up and running ASAP I would probably
try casting MesaLib first and adjusting NVIDIA-Linux-x86 so that
it no longer EPROVIDE MesaLib, updating the index, and then
casting NVIDIA-Linux-x86 so that it installs,
perhaps even overwriting some of the files installed by MesaLib
and then manually correcting any symbolic links that should be corrected.

Anyway, someone told me that NVIDIA-Linux-x86 provides MesaLib.
Apparently, that information was incorrect.
So I will adjust NVIDIA-Linux-x86 spell so that it no longer has an
EPROVIDE=&quot;MesaLib&quot;

Before anyone tells me to make a change in the grimoire
I expect that they have thoroughly tested it and confirmed it to be correct.
For me to second guess every recommendation and test it
myself would be insulting and impolite to my fellow SAs.

Long ago there was a modification made to gettext based upon a SA
absolutely assertion that it had to be have the library and header
components installed, although the same functionality was provided by glibc.
And not longer after change and after almost every installed spell on every
Sorcerer box was dynamically linked with gettext's library
then glibc's version went out of sync with gettext.
Consequently, a large amount of deployed Sorcerer boxes
had to be re-deployed from Install/Rescue CDs in order to correct that mess.
In my recollection that was the single biggest mistake in Sorcerer history,
because most senior level SAs had neither the experience nor intuition
required to untangle all the requirements on gettext's ELF SO.
It was not as simple as forcibly dispelling gettext
and recompilation what broke.
The breaks were far to extensive and involving
core programs used during the compilation process.
It was a far worse mess than having chewing gum stuck in one's hair.
However, this is just a minor inconvenience by comparison.

I prefer someone who has a NVIDIA graphics card
to do the fix and thoroughly test it, and make the changes.
If you want me to take a blind stab at it I can make
some time to fix it following the next release of the
x86_64 and ia32 I/R and source CD images.

As for me I went a full year without OpenGL graphics
when the OpenGL component of my NVIDIA card flaked out.
I kept thinking it was just bugs in the stupid drivers
since my card worked fine with non OpenGL programs.
Afterall it seemed that the card worked fine until a short while
after I did an update of the NVIDIA drivers and then after
never worked in OpenGL for more than 6 minutes without flaking
and finally crashed right away when attempting to do OpenGL.
NVIDIA's tech support did not help one bit
nor did the countless hours I spent searching
message boards and emails lists for a solution.
By the time I decided the card had malfunctioned
the card was already past the manufacturer's warranty limit.
Proprietary closed source drivers are not at all friendly for us to use.
Most of the time we can not tell if the malfunction is the driver's fault
or because the graphics card is about to catch fire.
For the moment I suggest trying to get an Xserver running
on the box without using NVIDIA-Linux-x86,
assuming you have no OpenGL programs that you must run.
The performance for non OpenGL programs will be excellent.
Watching movies and video will be excellent.
All non OpenGL ways it will be excellent.
I remember.  :)
You will not be displeased.

For the moment I will again mark the NVIDIA-Linux-x86 spell as broken.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
