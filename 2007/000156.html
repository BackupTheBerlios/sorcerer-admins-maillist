<PRE>XFree86 4.7.0 appeared!

But the more important question is do any Sorcerer SAs want to use it?
Needless to say balancing the grimoire with both xorg and XFree86 is difficult,
but not impossible.
However, some of the components of XFree86 that would replace components
of xorg are not necessarily drop-in replacements.
Some sources that compile with xorg installed may fail to compile with
XFree86 installed.
qt-x11-free I expect is one of those sources,
only because it would not compile with the previous XFree86 release.

Whenever I update the XFree86 spell I must search through the config files
of the source tree to try to discover all the drivers for hardware
that it supports.
Then I have to update the configuration menu, and so forth...
And I can not check every configuration combination either.
Therefore, as you would expect of xorg since it is already chopped up into
more than 300 source tarballs it is easier to do a partial and hardware
specific installation of xorg than it is for XFree86.

Even if I do not know whether updating 300 xorg related spells is
faster or slower
than updating merely one XFree86 spell, I am reasonably certain that testing
that compilation testing of that one large monolithic source tree of XFree86
does take longer.
Afterall if just one aspect of it fails I have to adjust
the configuration and start it over entirely.

If you want to use XFree86 please look at the Changelog and
the new docs at the website that describe the updates and
hardware that is supported.
My expectation is that most of our boxes will work just as nice using xorg.
However, since I have not yet bothered to read up
I will leave that decision to you guys.
If there is good reason to support XFree86
then we shall support it.
Otherwise let us remove XFree86 from the grimoire
as so not to hinder new Sorcerer SAs that are unaware
that almost all production Sorcerer boxes currently have
xorg installed instead of XFree86.
If we can settle upon using one standard
or the other we can minimize both errors and testing.

Since I noticed that the category index of one of my boxes was strange
I went ahead and debugged a problem with how several of the xorg
related spells were definied.
I also improved the existing xorg related spells making them smaller.
And as you know we already have the ability to select whether we want
to use the release versions for xorg related spells or the individual
xorg related spells by making that selection with
# cast xorg-individual
As the above information xorg related spells already have a comfortable
foothold in the grimoire a nice integration with other spells and
the flexibility to install the latest individually wrapped driver when
the release one falls short of performance expectations.
Although it is sort of like some maddening 500 piece puzzle,
in recent years we have grown used to it, yes?

Please think it over and report back with additional information that
you discover.
If everyone is fine with xorg and nobody has significant comment about
the new XFree86
then after 2 weeks or so XFree86 will depart from the grimoire,
because it would be misleading and frustrating for new SAs to expect that
we are supporting XFree86 in Sorcerer when actually it fell by the wayside.
