Those might yet be caused by trying to export a previous
XFree86 configuration file instead of generating a new one
with xorgconfig
You could save what you have and try generating a new one
based upon the information in the old one to see if it helps.

If you can spot missing requirements for spells with attribute
X11R7 then please do.
My guess is that they are most likely
involving spells that install only header files.
In those instances an augur lddof spell_name
would not detect spells requirements that are
not of an ELF library nature.

The last time I did tests were the initial cast of xorg
on a completely fresh deployment of Sorcerer.
Unfortunately, I did not detect any problems.
It could be in some cases that a potential problem
may be hidden merely due to the difference in order
of which spells being or finish compilation on different boxes.
Sorcerer does not enforce a strict order, but rather an order
that requires only explicitly related spells to compile and
install in order.
So if at no point in a requirement chain
does spell A requires spell B nor does spell B require spell A.
Then, either spell B or spell A could be cast first depending
upon which already has a source downloaded for it.
However, if all the required sources were already downloaded,
which was the case with my testing
then the order that spells A and B would cast in would be specific
to the order in which they appear in /root/.sorcery/index/order

I hope that is not upsetting.
However, knowing that fact may help identify why
cast xorg may work flawlessly on one box, but could
potentially trip on an unexpectedly required but not
spell that provides required header files for compilation.
So if you encounter it, please report specifically what spells are involved.
To circumvent add in those requirements if they are obvious,
but if not, download all the sources for spells with
proto as part of their name, regenerate the index,
and restart the cast of xorg.
That will probably step around any problems
involving required xorg header files not being installed.
