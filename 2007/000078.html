# grep &quot;binutils\|glibc&quot; /etc/sorcery/log/snap/gcc
binutils        2.17
glibc   2.3.6

Or maybe it does compile with 2.17?

Strange, but possible.

It may not be glibc related.
If it was me, I would find every file from domino.
Check if it is a dynamically linked ELF.
Determine all it's dynamic link libraries from an objdump.
Determine if it uses system installed versions of those libraries
or whether it uses the libraries that it provides.
Then, check them one by one against snapshot logs to see
what updated when might be causing the break.
Afterall, it could be any of 80 or more installed
software programs updated in the last 30 days.
If you can find out when it last started without error, from a log file.
And you find a snapshot log in /etc/sorcery/log/snap or /etc/sorcery/log/snapy
that is from just a moment before the server was started
then you will know exactly what software was installed when it worked correctly.

Then you can do something like:

# cat $OLD_SNAP $CURRENT_SNAP | sort | uniq -u

That will display any software that has since been uninstalled,
installed, or updated.
It may provide good clues.  If the problem is caused by a software update
then the culprit will definitely be on the list.
However, glibc might not be on that list.
glibc has not updated in a long time.
We have been using glibc 2.3.6 since probably around Nov 04, 2005
since that is the date of the tarball on the gnu ftp server.

I do not recommend using any of the experimental releases of glibc which are:
versions 2.4 and 2.5


&gt;<i> Any ideas, OS seems to be stable otherwise... allthough Domino is only big
</I>&gt;<i> problem i run inside those machines, but otherwise shell &amp; utils seems to
</I>&gt;<i> work flawlessly - except my Dominos...
</I>
I also would check for a library problem first.
However, I would not suspect or expect it to be glibc.
There are some very old pre-compiled commercial software
that for some reason or another require an ancient version of glibc.
Software from loki-games comes to mind.
Gentoo has a FAQ on how to get that stuff to run, if at all possible.
However, chances are you would not be using software that old
for a database server, simply because by now it would have so
many known bugs and vulnerabilities in it, but maybe not if it is
closed source?
Even so it would be strange if it was that old.

For most of the commercial software you are running your version of
glibc is ideal.
If the glibc was too old then more recent software could not run
because of missing symbols.
Likewise since your box has all the installed software compiled with
some version of glibc 2.3.x you could not downgrade glibc 2.2.x and
expect programs to run.

However, many binary based distros do not have as current support
libraries as Sorcerer has, such as libcurl and openssl.
Consequently, commercial software intended to run on binary based distros
which are dynamically linked were probably compiled with and linked with
older versions of those libraries.  Usually that is not a problem if
the commercial
software is statically linked with those libraries or provides those
libraries to
itself privately within it's installation.  However, a problem might
occur when it
uses a system wide installed library instead of a privately installed one,
if that can occur which probably does not.

Optimal running of commercial software requires providing the libraries that
it was intended to run with, however that does not require that those versions
of those libraries be system installed on a Sorcerer box.
You can install, for example, some libraries in /opt/lib
which is not normally in /etc/ld.so.conf nor should it be.
Then before you run the commercial software do
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&quot;/opt/lib&quot;
Then, when the runtime linker tries to load libraries to run the
commercial software
it will first use the libraries in /opt/lib before loading any of the
libraries with the
same names that can be found in /usr/local/lib and /usr/lib
/usr/lib64, .... and so forth.

Here is something that will help make better sense:

Commercial software X is compiled and dynamically linked to glibc version 2.1.2
Commercial software X runs on boxes that have the following versions
of glibc installed:
2.1.2
2.1.3
2.2.1
2.2.2
2.2.3
2.2.4
2.2.5
2.3
2.3.1
2.3.2
2.3.3
2.3.4
2.3.5
2.3.6

That is a wide range of distributions of various modern and decrepit ages that
software X can run on.

Compare that to commercial software Y that is linked with glibc 2.3
Commercial software Y runs on boxes with installed versions of glibc:
2.3.0
2.3.1
2.3.2
2.3.3
2.3.4
2.3.5
2.3.6

That is far less than software X.

That is why when it comes to pre-compiled binary commercial software it is often
linked with some of the oldest glibc and support libraries available anywhere.
The expectation is that by doing so it will run on a greater amount of distros
those that are old and those that are new.
However, we have seen that even when it comes to glibc that somewhere there
exists a great divide and that software that is sufficiently old enough can not
be run on modern boxes without a few glitches or aspects that a SA must fix
by providing some of those ancient libraries.

glibc is supposed to be backward compatible all the way back to the
first release.
Oddly enough it is not.  This may be in part due to changes with the
linux kernel?
But glibc provides sufficient backward compatibility that we can
update our boxes
as infrequently as yearly and still be able to run software compiled last year
with the glibc compiled yesterday.
Therefore, we experience very few library problems on Sorcerer boxes since
all the software tends to level up to current at about the same time.
Also the sorcery tools automatically handle recompilation and installation
of software when required to match a library update.
It is a nice convenience.
But it does not work for pre-compiled commercial software.
That is why extra care must be taken to provide pre-compiled
software with the exact libraries that were used when it compiled
in order to achieve optimal performance.
And as I mentioned above, this does not require
down-compiling a Sorcerer box to a state of years past.
If you do not want to compile the old libraries yourself,
and easy way to get them is to fetch them from Debian's ftp server.
Then, pry the libraries out of the debian package.
When it comes to old libraries Debian has them.

Hope you can spot the problem.
Do keep in mind that it may not be a library problem.
But it might.  It might also invoke some installed software/program
on the box that has changed it's parameters, for example,
and that might cause a crash.
The crash may be due to an update from Lotus Domino?
There might be a bug in the database that your loadout has triggered?
Either of the databases may be compromised or sabotaged?
Either of the boxes may be compromised or sabotaged?
It might not like bash 3.2.010, I had some problems making
sorcery compatible with the newer bash.
But if I had no clues to go on then I would start with a snapshot log comparison
comparing the last time the server started correctly with a snapshot from
the first time the server did not start correctly.

If you expect that it may become a problem
then you might want to create a wrapper for starting the server
that automatically makes a snapshot of installed software on the box
and deposits it in a directory so that you have those snapshots for
comparison instead of having to select snapshots from approximately
the same times from the directories in /etc/sorcery/log/
