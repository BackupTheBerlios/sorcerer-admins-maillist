Looks like I was the only person who could have made a case for keeping XFree86.
Who knows when the tide will change and favor will drift back towards XFree86?
However, we shall have to cross that bridge anew when and if that day comes.
XFee86 and the spell for the older version of it have been removed
from the grimoire.

Meanwhile I have started work on a new spell called:

ati-driver-installer

Maybe now that AMD has taken over ATI we may yet
receive some pre-compiled drivers that we can integrate
with a modern linux glibc xorg based POSIX operating system?
However, after examining the ?source? ?tarball? that they provide
it does not appear that they have gone back to formula on the drivers,
but continue to use pre-compiled code for which they will not release
the source code for due to agreements with blah blah blah and so forth.
In in other words it does not look much different from before.
But hopefully, it may work as a drop in that snaps right
into place with xorg X11R7.2
Perhaps a few days from now I will be able to test it.
For now it is in the grimoire with the attribute of broken.
When it is ready to go the the attribute broken will switch to new.

As for what OpenGL graphics card to buy.... I have no clue.
I merely know that I would not want NVIDIA nor ATI.
The xorg's savage driver for motherboards with integrated savage
seems to provide OpenGL, but I do not know at what speed
quality or compatibility relative to anything else.
Chances are there is a $30 -&gt; $50 card that will work awesomely
with xorg's open source OpenGL implementation.
Please feel free to nominate your favorite vendors and cards
in replies to this email message.
