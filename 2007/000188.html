<PRE>Hopefully, copying binutils from the Install/Rescue CD
has repaired the problem with binutils?
Almost any of the core spells can be repaired that way.
The loadout of the Install/Rescue CDROM is intentionally uncomplicated
in order to make repair of deployed Sorcerer boxes both apparent and easy.
Afterall it is both an Install disk and a RESCUE disk.  :)
If any other core spells are broken you can simply
copy them from the I/R to the hard disk and in most
cases that should fix it.

After copying binutils from cdrom to hard drive
the sorcery tools should be able to identify that
it is installed.

# augur version binutils
2.17

Should print a version number for binutils such as 2.17
But it may be an early version.

If it printed:
&quot;binutils inactive&quot;
then perhaps I mistyped the command to copy it?

Another method might be to try:

# mount /media/cdrom
# cat  /media/cdrom/etc/sorcery/log/install/binutils  |
tar  --no-recursion   -C /media/cd -cPT - |
tar -C / -xvpf -

A bit more eloquent, but also a bit more complicated.
If I typed that incorrectly then who knows what might happen, right?  ;)


After repairing binutils you may want to try:

# find {/media/cdrom,,}/etc/sorcery/log/install -type f -printf &quot;%P\n&quot; |
sort | uniq -u

That will tell you what spells are installed on the I/R
that are not installed on the hard disk filesystem.
If you are not certain if the spells printed are important to have
installed or not
then feel free to ask us.
Since it is odd that binutils was not installed
it seems probably that there may be other important spells
that are also not installed.

After all the important software is re-installed
I advise casting core
# cast core

core is a profile spell.
It keeps the spells that it requires installed.
Therefore, in the dispel menu you will see core listed.
Consequently, you will not be presented with the selection
of spells to dispel that core requires as long as you do not
select to dispel core.
That way you will only have to remember that core should
never be dispelled when you are selecting installed spells
to remove from sorcery's dispel menu.

There used to be another way of protecting
core spells from accidental SA removal.
But it was easy enough for a SA to accidentally turn off that feature.
Therefore, I switched to using the core profile spell.

The first line of core's description is:
&quot;core profile spell keeps important software installed&quot;

That would show up on the status line when the SA
moves the highlight bar over the core spell and
ponders whether to select it to be removed.
Hopefully the SA would read that and decide,
&quot;Wait, I should not select core for removal.&quot;
And the box would be saved from a bad break.

However, nothing about the operation
of any Sorcerer box is beyond the SA's control.
Nor is the SA hindered from doing whatever they want.
A SA can dispel core if they want.

Previously, you might have expected that there was
a database that had to be updated
after re-installing binutils from the I/R?
There is not.
The sorcery tools identifies the state of the box
by looking at the log files that are kept in /etc/sorcery/log/
Log files are very simple.

As you would expect the command:

# cat /etc/sorcery/log/version/binutils

prints the version of the installed binutils.

Likewise the following command:

# cat /etc/sorcery/log/install/binutils

prints the files and sometimes directories that were
created or modified during the installation of binutils.

Taking a look inside the install log for binutils you will see:

# grep &quot;/etc/sorcery/log&quot; /etc/sorcery/log/install/binutils
/etc/sorcery/log/compile/binutils
/etc/sorcery/log/id/binutils
/etc/sorcery/log/install/binutils
/etc/sorcery/log/ldd/binutils
/etc/sorcery/log/md5sum/binutils
/etc/sorcery/log/snap/binutils
/etc/sorcery/log/stat/binutils
/etc/sorcery/log/version/binutils

As the above command shows,
the install log for binutils also lists the other logs
about binutils that the sorcery tools use to precisely
identify the state of the installed binutils and identify
and correct problems with it.

However, if the problem is that binutils is not installed
then sorcery will not repair that type of problem since
sorcery is not authorized to do that type of repair.
To do so could create additional problems if the SA
intentionally dispelled binutils and has something else
installed in it's place but has not fully informed sorcery about it.

However, explaining about how to inform sorcery of the
custom and irregular situations of spell providing is too
much information for this email, yes.  :)

Hopefully you gained:
an understand where the sorcery log files are located;
a basic idea of what they contain.
Now you will be better prepared to fix any similar type of problem
in the very rare event that you encounter it again.

Even if learning the trick required a couple of days
in the future you will not perspire one drop in the mere
minute required to identify and fix that type of problem.
A mere 5 or even 15 minutes to identify
and repair problems on a Sorcerer box
requires far less time than to completely re-installation
and update from an Install/Rescue CD
that is over 6 months old,
not to mention re-installing
the rest of the software required
for the role the box performs.

You can feel pleased that you stuck it out and learned something.
This is why I encourage Sorcerer SAs to confront problems and learn.

Sorcerer is designed to be powerful, adaptable and simple.
With an extremely tiny learning curve not much time elapses
before a SA realize that nearly every system administration
task involving a Sorcerer box is trivially simple to accomplish.
No packages,
no package manager,
and no database for installed package information exist.
Every aspect about the sorcery tools is within the SA's grasp.
Both the sorcery tools and the information about installed
spells can be easily modified with any text editor.
Even with all that convenience the sorcery tools
are still adequately fast at performing nearly any task.

The box is probably not far from being in perfect working order
now that you have identified and fixed some problems.

After you are certain all the core software
and important software is installed please
run the command:

# augur alien  | tee /tmp/aliens.txt

That does a limited search in areas where spells
should have installed files and directories.
Files and directories in those areas that do not belong to spells are aliens.
The augur alien command finds aliens and prints their location.

An alien file or directory can indicate many potential situations.
An alien may indicate a spell should be installed.
It might indicate intrusion.
It might indicate that the SA mistyped a tar or cp command.
It might be left over intentionally from a spell.
For example, the strace spell requires that the SA
manually remove the file /usr/bin/strace
if strace is to be dispelled.

A review of any aliens may help spot any loose ends
on a box that is nearly repaired.
When you are certain an alien is not required and should not be installed
then you can either remove it or do something like:

# mkdir -p /root/aliens
# chmod 0700 /root/aliens
# mv $ALIEN /root/aliens/

That way you can save it in a place where normal users
can not execute, modify or read it.
If it turns out to be important you can put it back later.
However, with an exception of aliens found in /etc
which might be configuration files,
most aliens are safe to remove.

Good luck and have fun at bringing your box
back to full speed and performance.
Even if you start to feel and understand the reason why
Sorcerer is called an distribution for senior level SAs
your ability will soon rise up to meet the challenge
as long as you have the required tenacity.

Merely two traits define senior level SAs.
Neither trait is knowledge nor experience.
The foremost trait for a senior level SA is tenacity.
The second and less important trait is the ability to teach oneself.
Those who lack the tenacity can never become senor SA.
Those who have the tenacity can not fail to become senior SA
when that level of ability is required.
And the best way to hone tenacity is to ride out the problems.

If the trend continues it will probably be another 3 or 4 years
before another SA reports a problem about a core or very important
spell not being installed.
This sort of repair is rare.
Lucky you, right?  :)
