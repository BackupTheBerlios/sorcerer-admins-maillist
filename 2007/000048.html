<PRE>Perhaps seeing double was the expected effect of
# augur scry glibc
executed at that moment.

Upon execution of augur scry
the compile log is first cat.
Then, it is followed with tail.
Due to executing both cat and tail
the last line or lines that exist
when augur scry is executed
may be printed more than once.

If that is the case then the only way to be certain
that it did not dispel twice
is to look at the compile log,
probably /usr/src/sorcery/.meta/glibc.log

It probably did not dispel twice.


glibc fails to cast for usually one of two reasons.
Either the install log for the installed glibc is incorrect.
Or bits and pieces of untracked and older glibc exist
in /lib, or on x86_64 architecture in /lib64.

Doing checks before casting glibc on a box where it is
expected to fail is probably best.
The task is fairly easy for a SA,
but difficult to script since a wrong
assumption made during the creation
of the script could cause glibc to break
upon the script's execution.
When an alien file must be pruned from /lib
the SA should be careful to prune the files
that should be pruned and log the files in
the glibc log that should be kept.

Below are some sample tests a SA might try:

# for file in /lib/*; do grep -qrx &quot;$file&quot; /etc/sorcery/log/install ||
echo &quot;$file&quot;; done

The above may display untracked files in /lib

ls /etc/sorcery/log/install/glibc*

Is something called glibc-failed installed?
That would cause a break.
Something called glibc-dev installed?
Is the glibc install log mysteriously absent?
Those could all become problems.

# grep &quot;^/lib/&quot; /etc/sorcery/log/install/glibc | while read; do [ -e
&quot;$REPLY&quot; ] || echo &quot;$REPLY&quot;; done

Did it print that any lines starting with /lib/ are tracked but do not exist?
If it did then the glibc install log may not be correct
for the installed version of glibc.
Directly modify glibc's install log to correct it.

What spells installed files in /lib/?
Should not be many.

# grep -lr &quot;^/lib/&quot; /etc/sorcery/log/install | cut -d / -f6
glibc
bzip2
gcc
libcap
init-functions
procps
shadow
linux-fusion
zlib
pcre
udev
e2fsprogs
acl
linux
kqemu
ncurses
device-mapper
readline
fuse
attr

Is there a spell with files installed under /lib that
perhaps should not be installed?

# grep &quot;^/lib/&quot; /etc/sorcery/log/install/glibc

/lib/libutil.so.1

Are there files in /lib that should be on the above
list but mysteriously missing.
A clean reap of the installed glibc is essential
for the newly compiled glibc to install successfully.

There is a high probability that you will spot and
be able to correct the problem if you check for it.
I apologize that is not something that I can script
for and feel safe and satisfied about the script.
However, I can check the box personally 1st hand if you want.
If what I wrote above does not solve the problem,
which it should solve in most cases,
then the problem will probably only be detected
and solve by direct inspection by a SA.
Could be something odd like an old or untracked or
developmental version of binutils installed
or an unexpected problem due to the compiler being used
or one or more trojaned executables installed.
Those possibilities are so remote I can not begin to estimate the odds.

I once inspected a box that could not tracked files installed
by spells because the installed version of findutils was broken.
Oh, that was so long ago now that the findutils spell no longer
even contains the comment about what version to never use.
However, I would expect that a box broken in that way would
either be unable to cast glibc, or unable to cast a newer glibc
after the older glibc installed, because the install log for the
older installed glibc would be lacking entries for files that
were installed in /lib/

It may even be possible, although unlikely,
that a problem with a file installed in /usr/include
may cause glibc to mis-compile.
However, that is very unlikely since the glibc spell
provides not only the glibc header files to use,
but also the specific linux kernel header files to use
for compilation of glibc.

Try the recommended above checks please.
I apologize for harping about it.
But there is no sense going on a wild goose chase
before shooting the ducks floating in the barrel.
