That gives an overview of what processes are consuming the CPU cycles.

That gives an overview of what sorcery may be doing
or could be doing on the box.

The delay between when a spell is cast and
when it begins may be due to several factors.
1. grep runs far more slowly now than it did in the past.
2. When a spell is cast every spell that spell requires
must be checked to see if it is fully configured.
3. The SA is presented with configuration dialogs
for spells that have not yet been fully configured.
4. Sources for spells that must be compiled have to be downloaded
if they are not already available on the local box.
5. The spell requested to cast may be waiting
for the spells that it requires to be installed.

Here is an example:

Spell C requires spell B.
Spell B requires spell A.
Box has spell A installed.
SA requests Spell C cast.
Spell C must wait until spell
B finishes casting before
beginning to cast spell C


Unlike leech and cast which can automatically invoke the other
dispel can not automatically invoke any other sorcery utility.
The appearance of &quot;waking up&quot; due to a spell being dispelled
is merely coincidental timing.

Lastly, a new cast request that occurs
while sources are being compiled
will take a few times longer to be processed
than a cast request on a box that is otherwise idle.
But it will still work.
