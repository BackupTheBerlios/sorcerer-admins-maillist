<PRE>&gt;<i> About db, there is no that line &quot;patchin file&quot;, and cast -c db does not
</I>&gt;<i> help, i have tried that many times.
</I>&gt;<i> I looked my /var/cache/sources/db/4.5.20/ and there is indeed 2 patch files,
</I>&gt;<i> patch.4.5.20.1 and .2, any ideas why it does not patch them? Maybe some
</I>&gt;<i> error in build()?
</I>
Perhaps it is?
I rewrote the two lines which apply the patch file.
It now uses what is expected to be the precise path/name to the patch file.

PCX=1
while  [  -n  &quot;${SOURCE[$PCX]}&quot;  ];  do
  patch  -p0  &lt;  $SOURCE_CACHE/$SPELL/$VERSION/${SOURCE[$PCX]}
  ((  PCX++  ))
done

That should also be faster than before.

Next time you cast the spell you could try inserting a
set -x
at the top of the build.
It will however, end up with many lines of cast execution also
dumped into the compile log.
But if you at least encompass the part where it begins
the patch to the part where it finishes the patch with:
set -x
...
...
set +x

Then, whatever it is doing that is unexpected shall be revealed.
:<i>)
</I>
Also...
You could check out those files in the source cache.
Those two files that are supposed to be patch files?
Are they patch files?
Or are they some poorly configured server that wrote
Some type of error 404 message into a text or HTML file
instead of actually throwing an error 404 back to the browser.
When patch is invoked on a file that is not a patch file,
patch usually process it silently and produces no line
stating that any file was patched or if there was a problem
with the patch file.
That is most likely the problem that the files in the source
cache which are supposed to be patch files are not patch files.
Therefore, no matter how many times the spell casts the
source is not properly patched.
