<PRE>Seems very unusual.

If something incredibly strange happens, like above,
you may have to issue
pkill cast
Then, take a look at the process list using top and/or ps
and see if anything is still running that should not be.
Then, perhaps kill that also.

Generally, it can be dangerous to pkill cast because it
may be in the process of installing files.
Some files may be installed, all that is installed might not be tracked, etc...

The only thing about the services spell that might cause it to hang appears
to be the grep statement in it.
grep runs incredibly slow on some boxes.
Not 13 hours type slow.
But I suppose it could if it encounter that sort of bug.

I replaced that grep with a sed statement
and it will go out in the next massive grimoire update.
Thanks for reporting the problem.
It probably is not distribution wide, I hope.

As for setting up a windows environment.
Cast wine and use kde together and that seems to work.
After installing wine run winecfg as the user who wants to
install and run win32 software.
That will allow setting up of the type of M$ compatible API
and the directories, and so forth.
Much software can now be run within wine.
wine updates more frequently than once per month.

The main problem you may encounter is that z: or some other
letter may be mapped to your home directory.
Some malicious win32 software might bug, spy, trojan, virus,
delete, overwrite, encrypt, or corrupt files in your home directory.
Just because you run your win32 software within wine will
not protect your home directory against the ill effects of running malware.
It could, perhaps, even install a custom plugin for firefox within your
home directory to spy on your web browsing.

Another option is to run an actually M$ operating system within qemu.
qemu's ia32 emulation is decent.
It's x86_64 emulation is slow.
But it is an option.
